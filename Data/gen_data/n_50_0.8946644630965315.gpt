Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

You need to be a member of This Old Dog to add comments!

I agree with other posts here about not being too strict with this.  It is a great song, but it just wasn't a good fit for us.  We don't like all of the same stuff other people like.  But we still have fun with it, and it's a good record.

I've listened to a lot of the songs on the CD, and it is certainly not perfect.  Some of the songs are great, others are forgettable.  But it is not that bad.

I've listened to some of the songs and I do like the sax player a lot.  At first I had a lot of problems with him, but after reading the reviews I decided to listen to him again.  He has improved a lot.  He is actually a good player.  I really like the band.  They have a good sound.  I'm glad we didn't have to buy this at first.  It is a good CD.

Songs I did not like

Bad News, I'm In the Band.  Too loud.  The song is great, but not what we wanted to do.

The New Day

We did not like the other songs that were on this disc.  The rest of the songs are good, but not what we wanted to do.

Ain't No Sunshine

We did not like the other songs that were on this disc, but we did like the song.  The sax player was good, but not what we wanted to do.

I like the CD, but I didn't like all of the things on it.  Some of the songs are good, but not what we want to do.  But overall I thought it was a good CD.

I bought some records from Amazon and not all of them were good.  I think some of the CDs were very good, but this was not one of them.  I liked the songs off of this CD, but not all of them.  I would not buy it again.  I'm disappointed in the record company.  I would have liked to have liked all of the songs on this CD.  They are not perfect, but they are good.  I do not think they should have put them on the CD.  It is not a bad CD, but it is not what I was expecting.  I would not buy it again.  I would listen to

Amazon review: This song is a complete rip off of the Beatles' song "And Your Bird Can Sing", and it is sung by a female. I have no idea who the artists are, and I can't find the song anywhere, as far as I know. I don't really care. The song is awful, and it sounds like they ripped off a song called "I Think I'm Going Bald", which is a great song, but not one suitable for Christmas. I wouldn't pay for this song, and if I ever find out who the artist is, I will let you know.

Amazon review: I bought "Ray's Christmas Classics" after reading many reviews about the album. I must state that I am not a fan of this album, and I hate that it is on my computer. The song "I'll Be Home for Christmas" is the best song on the album. The song, "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town", is very nice, but the song, "It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas", is not that great. The song, "Frosty The Snowman", is very nice and very catchy. But the song, "Christmas Morning", is very boring. The song, "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town", has a very cool beat and sounds like they have played it before. The song, "Frosty The Snowman", sounds like it was an original by the Beatles. They have done a good job with this song. I would recommend this CD if you like Christmas albums.

This is NOT what I expected at all. I don't think I will never buy this album. I expected something better.

This is from the new album but I doubt it will be released. I’m sure that it will be out when it is released, but I wouldn’t expect it to be released until the 25th of September.

I don't know what to say about this one. I'm not really the type of person who likes "unpolished" work, I prefer something that is polished and a little more "mature". Well, this was neither of those.

The production was very average at best, I don't think it was good enough to be nominated for Best Recording Package, the only thing that it had going for it was that it was released on vinyl and this was on CD.

The vocals were ok, not great, and it was very boring. It was like listening to a recorded song of a person singing in a low voice. The sound quality was not at all to my liking, it was too quiet, and I was afraid that I would miss something.

The music was average to me, it had a few songs that I liked, but overall the music was not at all memorable, and not even memorable at all. I would like to believe that the music was recorded live, but it was not, and I am not sure that it would have been any better.

This is a really bad album. I would like to have liked it, but I just don't. I was expecting something nice from this, but I just didn't get it. I'm not sure what happened to this album, I think I have been looking for something like this for a really long time but I had never found it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: A few notes about the performance - the lead vocalist was not that great. The backup singers were very good. The piano was playing at a very quiet level which made for a very intimate experience. I was disappointed in the recording.

Amazon review: I found this CD last year.  I had heard about the artist, but it wasn't until I saw it on the cover that I decided to buy it.  At first I was very happy with the CD, but after a while I began to get tired of it.  I'm used to having good sound quality on my CD's but this one had very low sound quality.  I'm not sure if it was my speakers which made the difference or if it was a bad recording.  I'm sure it was not the sound quality, but after about six months of listening to it, I began to feel the same way I did when I first heard it.  I've tried to find a record that I liked more, but I can't.  I haven't listened to it in a while, but it's hard to find a record which you like more than the other.

Amazon review: I heard this CD on the radio, and I wanted to have it for my collection.  I've listened to it twice now, and I like it. The CD is more traditional than most CD's I've heard.  The songs are very nice, and I do like the instrumentation.  It's just a matter of whether or not you like what you hear.  If you do like the CD, you'll love the instrumentation.  You'll also love the vocals.  I don't usually like the vocals I hear on regular radio, but I really like the vocals on this CD.  I like the sound, but not the vocals.  The vocals on this CD are much better than the ones on the other CDs I've listened to.  The instrumentation is also better than usual.  It's just a matter of if you like the CD or not.  After listening to the CD two times, I'm still undecided if I like it or not.  I like the instrumentation, but the vocals are a little off.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves traditional music.  It's worth the money to me.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band since 1991, when I first heard the song "Lovers" off of their self-titled album. I've always loved their music and they have become my favorite band, ever. When this album was released I was thrilled, not only because of the band's amazing talent but also because I felt like my life was finally in order. To my disappointment, however, this album was an absolute disappointment. The album's lead single was the title track, "The Spirits of the Heart", and I found it to be a bit too corny and derivative of a much superior song by the band.  It was kind of a "what do you expect" kind of album. I thought that the band might have written a song that was just as good as their lead single but instead they came up with the mediocre "Lovers".  The album also had a number of songs that were not very original.  The rest of the album was pretty average. There were a couple of good songs such as "Caught By The Light" and "In My Arms" but most of them were just average.  The album's biggest strength was not in the music but in the artwork. The cover art was beautiful and showed the whole band in their best look and the album's title track was a great follow up to the previous single, "Lovers". The only song that disappointed me was "I Can't Stop", but really, that was the only song that really stood out from the rest of the album. The album ended up selling a few thousand copies and its not really that bad of an album.  Just don't buy it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album because I love the band and I love their music.  Unfortunately, I had to wait until it was released and by that time it was already out of print and I could not find a copy online or at any stores.  This album is still available to listen to online and is good although it is not always 100% accurate.  The album starts with the song, "The Spirits of the Heart" and then goes on to the songs "Caught By The Light", "In My Arms", "I Can't Stop" and "The Way We Were"  Most are good but the album does lack in the songs that are not as good.  I would still recommend this album to fans of the band and would say it is worth purchasing.  But, like I said, it is always better to wait.  I bought the album because the artwork was just so amazing and it has a great cover art. I have to be honest, I had the album for about a week and when I finally managed to purchase it, I was so disappointed in my purchase.  When I listened to it, it was like it was a complete waste of my money.  The album starts with the song, "The Spirits of the heart" but goes on to songs like "Caught By the Light" and "In My Arms" which were average.  The album is worth a listen if you are a fan of the band but I would highly recommend you wait until you have the album before you purchase it.  The album is available to listen to online for free and should not be considered as a loss.  I have listened to it online and I am only giving a positive review since I have listened to it once.  I guess I will listen to it again once more and see if it is any different.  If you like the band and their music, I suggest you find a copy of the album and give it a listen.  It is well worth it. I found it to be very good and well worth the money.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: As a child, I remember listening to my brother playing the piano, and I would sit at the piano bench and just listen to him play. He would play songs and I would just listen and play songs. This was a wonderful experience. My interest in the piano has never waned as I am now a professional pianist. I am very happy to share my enthusiasm with the world.

Review: I had a bit of a problem in choosing a book to review. I decided to read one of the books in the Schubert series. I am not an avid Schubert fan, but I love this series. I decided to read this book, and I have to say, it is a wonderful book. The first book in the series, I did not think was very good, but this one was a great read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Schubert and is looking for a beautiful book to read.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had this on a plane and my wife asked me if I wanted to hear it so I pulled it out.  I've had quite a few CDs like this over the years.  I'd rather have a CD that sounds great than a CD that sounds bad in comparison to the others.  I think these are the same guys that put out "In the Meantime" in 1999.  I really like "For the Love of the Game" from this release.  It's a great ballad that just hits you in the feels.  The saxophone player is decent.  I'll take one that sounds decent over one that sounds bad any day.  I've never had a bad CD in my collection.  I just haven't been able to find them.  The CD has a 2 song bonus track that is really cool.  It's a different version of a song but the original version was included on the CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I got this CD by mistake.  It's a good CD, but a few of the songs have been played by other artists.  I don't usually like CDs with bonus tracks, but in this case they do work. The bonus track is a good song, but it is the only song that was recorded prior to the release of the CD.  I recommend this CD to anyone that likes to listen to music.  This CD does have a few bonus tracks.  There are a few songs that are a bit cheesy, but most of the songs are good.  The songs I listen to are ones that I normally won't get the chance to hear.  I have a CD with "Bells & Whistles" and "I've Got You" by Johnny Mathis that I bought on a whim.

Amazon review: Very good CD!  I purchased this CD to hear the new record.  I was really surprised by the quality of this album.  I've never heard an album this good come out of Toronto.  It's a great CD.  I bought a few albums at the same time and this one is the best.  I don't know what happened to the rest of the CDs I bought at that time, but this one is definitely the best.  I'd recommend anyone who enjoys great music to get this CD.

Amazon review: I picked this CD up because I have been wanting to hear this album for years.  It is a very good album, and it is much better than I thought it would be.  The CD is a great mix of old and new.  There are some great songs on this CD, and some songs that I had never heard before.  It was a great listen.  I bought this CD at a really low price.  I have a lot of CDs that I have played through and through and they don't sound as good as this one.  I will likely buy it again.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I like the band, and I was impressed by the quality of the CD.  I wish I had bought this album when I first heard it.  It has been a while since I have listened to anything from this band, and I miss being able to hear their music.  They put out some great material, and I have not heard it before, so I was really impressed by the quality of this CD.  I don't know which of the songs are the best, but they are all good.  I would like to see them do an acoustic version of this album, because they sound great on this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the only CD I have ever bought based on a recommendation from someone.  It's a good CD, but it is not the greatest CD I have ever bought.  I bought this CD because I like the band, and I liked their previous CD, "Dirty Blonde".  I like the material on this CD, and I think this may be their best album.  I'm glad I bought it.  I like the CD.  It's a good CD.  I'm glad I bought it.  It's a good CD.  I don't know why I didn't buy it when I first heard it, but I will probably buy it again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have to say I have been a fan of this band for a long time now.  I've known them since about 1993.  Their first album was "Onyx" and it was a huge success.  They had a #1 pop hit, "I Just Wanna Dance" which was in heavy rotation on radio station stations and was also number 1 on the Billboard club charts.  They had a huge hit with "Fantasy."  Then they had another huge hit with "Ain't No Fun."  They have a couple other songs on their album that I like but I can't remember the name of the song right now.  I'm sure I'll remember it tomorrow.  I think this is their best album.  I love the song "New York" and their song "Tuxedo Junction."  Their song "Manhattan Transfer" is very powerful and emotional.  I can't remember their other song on this album but I think it's called "The Closer."  It's about a woman that's been cheated on and wants to leave her husband.  
I love the group.  I love their music and they are very talented.  All of this has to be put into consideration when buying a cd from this band.  I had to get the standard version because it was on the cheaper side.  The cd is overpriced, the cover is terrible, the music is not very good, the lyrics are not very good, and the sound quality is horrible.  They are one of the few bands that have released the song "Tuxedo Junction" on a cd, but they are doing a cover of it.  It's just not worth the price.  I would not recommend this cd to anyone else.  I would probably give it to my children as gift, but I would give it to my parents.  The cd is just not good enough to be on a cd.

Amazon review : I have been looking for a CD with Christmas music for many years. I found this CD in a small Christian music shop, but I was not sure that a small Christian music store had what I was looking for, so I went directly to Amazon. I was very pleased with my purchase.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I got a message from my mom saying that she is sick and could I please pick her up? I thought I'd take the chance and pick her up. I brought her home, where she had a nice time, then I went to the gym to work out. I got home and as I was driving home, I heard a voice that said "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry." I thought it was a joke. I turned down the radio and I thought it was a joke. I went into the house. My mom was laying on the floor. She looked at me and said "I'm sorry I let you down. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." And I knew I was in trouble. I had to call an ambulance. It took two hours and when I got there I was told my mother was dead. I don't know what to do. I'm very sorry.

Amazon review: I've got a lot of positive reviews but I have to say I've only downloaded one song that I really like. The song I really like is called "Pump Up The Volume". It is a really good song and I think it is a good song for the summer and I think that it is a really good song to go to when you are driving and you want to pump it up and turn up the volume. It has good energy and I think it will make you want to go dancing.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

This CD is a compilation of live versions from a couple of their shows that I have attended.  I thought this was a great way to share the live show with people who had not been to the shows.  If you are a fan of their music, then you will love this CD.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

This was also a little challenging for me to listen to the entire album.  I listened to it until I could not stand it any longer.  I have now listened to it on CD, but I don't think it's worth the money.  It's good for relaxation only, I don't think it's good for meditation or relaxation.  The songs are very relaxing and the instrumentation is very soothing.  The only thing I didn't like about this CD was the song "I'm Not a Soldier" which is a very repetitive song.  It's a little annoying to listen to, but I just had to listen to it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have listened over and over again to this album. I have listened to it about 10 times now and I still don't understand what people are talking about. The only songs that I can really relate to are "The Devil's Daughter" and "The Good Guys." "The Good Guys" is one of the better songs on the album, but then again, all of the songs on this album are good songs. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves old western music.

Amazon review: This is the only song I have ever heard from this band. The lyrics are great, but the music just doesn't do it for me. I don't like the vocals or the guitar solo. I also don't like the fact that one of the songs is about a girl who is a lesbian, which is an offensive theme towards gay people. The two other songs are decent, but they do not stand out to me. I am not going to buy this album simply because of the songs.

Amazon review: This is a great old western album. The guitars, drums, vocals, and the whole band are all excellent. The only thing I don't like about this album is that it is missing the "old west theme" which is a big part of the band's music. I would also like to note that this album is very well produced and sounds as if it was well recorded. The only reason why I gave this album a high rating was that they had an excellent version of "The Devil's Daughter". I would give this album a 9/10.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: It's the only way to describe it.  I love Meghan Trainor, but she needs to take a break.  She's the best thing to happen to country music in the last several years.  She's got talent, she's a great voice, she's very talented and she's the best at what she does.  I can't see how she could improve.  She's not perfect.  She has flaws.  She doesn't get it right on every song.  She's a great singer, but she needs to take a break.  It's only making her more famous, but it's killing her.  It's killing her as an artist.  It's making her look like she's in a hurry.  It's making her sound like she's trying too hard.  I understand that she's an amazing artist, but it's killing her.  If she wanted to improve, she would've done it. She didn't.  I just can't see how she could possibly improve.  She's just not an amazing artist at all.

Amazon review:  This is so bad.  I'm not sure what happened, but in the past few months I've discovered that Meghan Trainor has lost all her creativity.  It's not the song writing, it's not the vocals.  It's not the music.  It's all Meghan's fault.

Amazon review: I was absolutely floored when I first heard this album!  I've always loved Meghan Trainor's voice and music.  She sings beautifully and she's a very talented artist.  Now I'm worried that she's lost all her creativity.  I just don't know what to do.  I've listened to it over and over and I still can't help but be in awe of it.  I feel completely lost right now.  I want to love this album, but I'm just so confused.  I hope she finds the inspiration she needs to continue to make music.  I want to support her, but I'm just so confused.

Amazon review: There's a million songs about being a teenager, but that doesn't mean they should feel like they have to be just that.  There's a huge number of great songs about being a teenager that you can listen to without thinking about it in the least bit.  So why not go with something like Meghan Trainor's new single "Love Myself" and make the song your song?  Or why not turn "No Good Thing About You" into your song?  You can still enjoy yourself and have fun, but you can also be the one at the top of the song.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I've bought in a couple of years that has made me tear up a little.  It has been on repeat since it was released, and I can't seem to stop listening to it.  I'm not sure what's going on, but I feel like I've lost my mind.  I just want to sing along and have a good time.  I'm not sure why it's making me cry, but it is.  I'm not sure what's happening.  I don't think I've heard a song like this in a long time.  I just don't even know.  It's such an emotional song.  It's almost like it's telling me to make the best out of my life and not be so sad.  I don't know what to do.  I'm hoping that someone will understand and help me.  Please.  Please tell me why this album is so great!  I don't know why this is making me cry, and I don't know why I'm not crying.
