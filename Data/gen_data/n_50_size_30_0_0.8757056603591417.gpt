Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I like the fact that there are a lot of songs that you can sing along with.  Also, the music is very well written and very well produced.  My favorite songs are "I'm In Love With You", "Somethin' Fishy" and "The Way".  The only bad thing about this CD is that it is a bit hard to listen to sometimes because of the lyrics.  It has a very good beat to it and I like that.  Overall, I am extremely impressed.

Amazon review: I have never been a big fan of jazz music.  I feel that when music is played with a lot of emotion or passion, it gets to me.  When jazz music is played without emotion or passion, it is not as enjoyable to listen to.  I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed with this album.  I thought it was going to be heavier than other jazz albums I've listened to.  The music was not that heavy but it definitely had a lot of emotion and passion.  I enjoy this album, I think that it would be a good starting point for a jazz lover.  Also, the person who wrote the lyrics for the album is an excellent story-teller.  Overall, this album was a bit disappointing.

Amazon review: This album is a great album.  I'm a big fan of jazz music, and this album has been very exciting for me.  There are a lot of different types of music on this album, but I think that it all works together very well.  The lyrics are very interesting, especially for someone who is not a jazz fan.  There are a lot of different types of music on this album.  The first tracks on the album are very straight-forward, then later on songs like "Haircut", "The Ledge" and "Dance with Me..." have a lot of jazz influence but they still have a lot of other music in the background.  I really like the different styles of jazz music that are being used on this album.  Overall, this album is very exciting for me.

Amazon review: This is the first jazz album I have ever heard that has been produced by a woman. I was completely blown away by this album.  This is my first jazz album ever.  I'm not a big jazz fan, but I have been intrigued by the music coming from the other side of the pond.  I've heard a lot of other jazz albums in the past, but this album, it made me want to hear more.  It was so beautiful and so smooth that my brain was spinning.  The lyrics are very clever and interesting.  I haven't been able to listen to this album without wanting to sing it.  It's a very beautiful and unique album.

Amazon review: I first heard this band in the early 80's on a cassette-record of the band's performance at a local bar. I heard "Heartbeat" and "Livin' in a Dream" and instantly bought the cassette. Later on I added "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven" to the cassette-record and gave it to my girlfriend. Soon after she gave me the cassette-record and I was hooked.
As time went on I bought every album of the band, which was a great amount. But the cassette-record is the one I cherish.
I love this band, and always will.
This band is amazing.

I bought this album in 1982 when it came out and it was one of the first CDs I ever bought. I had never heard of the band but they were one of the bands I had been looking for. I've been hooked on this band ever since.

I bought this in the 70's and I heard them on a cassette tape I had. I was a fan of this band and they really were good. I was a fan of their music from way back. I have been a fan of this band since I heard them on a cassette tape my Mom had. I have been going to the shows since then and have been a fan ever since.

So I loved this album and bought it just because I loved the band and the songs. I have been listening to it for a while now and I am glad I bought it. I have been trying to find a LP of this album but I can't find it anywhere. I love the songs and the album. I would buy it again if I could find a copy. I have been a fan for a long time and it was a great purchase.

I have been a fan of this band since I was a kid listening to their early albums. I was a huge fan of their early albums. I first heard them on cassette tape. I would listen to their music for hours on end. Not to mention, I was one of the few people who didn't like the band. When I became a teenager I discovered their music. I found out they had been doing concerts since the 70's. I went to a few of their concerts and it was the best way to see them. I was only a teenager and I saw them in concert. I went to their last concert and it was the best concert I have ever been to. If you are ever in their town, it is a must see. I would go to a concert if I was in their town.

I have been a fan of this band since I was about 9 years old. I first heard them on a cassette tape my mom and I used to listen to. I had my eyes on the band for quite a while. I was an early fan of them and I thought they had potential. I was a huge fan of the band until I saw them live in concert. They were really good. I was only a teenager and the concert was great. I don't think they will ever be big but I know they have a huge fan base. I would go to their show any chance I had.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I loved the first CD, but this one just doesn't do it for me.  I really like the vocals on this CD.  I feel like I'm getting something completely different from the first CD.  I still like it, but I don't love it.  The backing vocals are great on this CD but the lyrics are not as deep as some of the other CDs.  The lyrics are very good on this CD but the voice is not as good as the first CD.  I like the song, but I'm not a fan of the CD.  I think I'll get some other CDs for Christmas anyway.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: So many beautiful songs that touch you in whatever stage your life is in.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was hoping by now to have found a good cd to compliment my vinyl collection. I was very disappointed when I first heard the band's cd.  It is not a good cd by any means.  The sound is pretty bad; I have no idea why they are playing for me.  But it is good enough to keep my collection alive and hopefully give me another collection in the future.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this CD!  I got the original version on CD, the '69 version on cassette and the '93 version on CD.  I like the '69 version better than the original cd.  It sounds like the original cd.  The only reason I didn't buy the original cd is the cover art. The other four have beautiful covers and I like that.  I also like the '93 more than the cassette.  The '93 was the one I started with and the only one I got from a friend who had it.  I don't have the original cd.  It was a great cd and I like the '69 version better than the original cd.  The other 3 cd's I got on cassette.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a beautiful album.  The lyrics are very complex.  This is a perfect album to put on a quiet night and listen to.  When I first heard this album I had to check the lyrics to make sure I was not giving myself nightmares.  I am only on the 1st side and have not heard all of the songs yet so I am not 100% sure what the song is named.  I am sure I will love the song names.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an amazing album.  I am not sure I have ever heard a band that is more original than this one.  I love the cover art.  It is beautiful and the pictures alone would be enough to convince me to buy the cd.  The band is very talented and I am definitely going to check out the cd.  I have never heard of this band or this type of music before so I am not sure what to think when I am listening to it.  I am not sure if this is a good or bad cd or if I am just a little slow...this is a good CD.
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure if this is an album you should buy or not.  I liked the first two albums but after I heard the cd I didn't like it.  I don't know what the cd is about.  I listened to it on a walk and the whole thing was pretty bad.  The lyrics were pretty bad and the music was very average.  It was basically a cd full of the same type of songs over and over.  The lyrics were not good and the music was not good.  The music had one song that I thought was really good and I listened to it for a long time.  I thought it was one of the best songs on the cd but I listened to it so long that I didn't remember what other song it was.  I'm not sure if the cd is worth it.
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Amazon review: This is a good cd.  I really like the cover art and I really like the songs on it.  The songs seem to have a good amount of melody.  I don't have too much to say about this cd.  It is a good cd that is worth it.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I am not a big fan of any of their albums.  I purchased this cd because I heard that it had a great cover art.  I figured it would be a good buy.  I bought the cd anyway.  It is a good cd.  I liked the first two albums and I enjoyed the cd.  It is a good cd.  The cd has some good songs on it and some bad songs on it.  It is a good cd.  It is different.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes bluegrass

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I have never been a fan of eminem but this album was a breath of fresh air because it is a new start for him. this album could have had an even better title but all it had was a very good song.
I have always felt that eminem is a "good" singer but he doesn't try to sound anything other than what he is. he could have had more songs like this

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have a hard time finding songs from this band that I don't hate.  This is one of the songs that I can't stand.  It is very repetitive and annoying.  The only good part to this song is that it is a "dance" song.  I am not a fan of this style of music.  I don't understand why they put so much emphasis on this song.  They should have just put a good song together and not come up with a song that is supposed to be a dance song.  I wish they would have stayed away from this type of song.  I don't have the patience to listen to this song for more than three minutes and I only listen to this song when I am with my girlfriend.

Amazon review: I didn't think I was gonna like this song, but I am so glad I did.  This song really made me want to see the band live.  I was disappointed that it was sung in a rather old school style.  I thought the first verse and the chorus were pretty good.  However, this song is not a stand out song, I don't know what else to say.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It makes you feel like you are in the concert hall.  This CD really does bring back great memories of the Mozart piano concertos.  The first CD is not the greatest, but it is better than the second CD.  For me, it is the best.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

I found it very frustrating that the songs were all a little different from each other.  I could see why this album would be so popular, but I didn't like the songs.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this CD.  I had never listened to Meghan Trainor, but I was hoping she would take a stab at singing opera.  This album is a disappointment.  The songs are all a little different and have many words and even a few lyrics that leave you scratching your head.  It is not a bad album and I guess I will find another album.  I have been listening to Christina Aguilera's music for a while, but this is not my type of music.

I like the songs, but I wish the songs were done a bit differently.  I wish the songs were more simple.  I hope Meghan Trainor releases another CD soon.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album for the first time and I have to tell you that I am really surprised. I thought the songs were really good, but somehow they all seem to have different melodies, and they seem to lack the passion that we are used to (at least that I am used to). The singing is really good, but I think that the songs are more of a pop album, without the passion of the songs of the first album. I don't really know what to improve on. The only thing I think is missing is the ballads. And I think that if I would have more songs like "The Dream Come True", I would really like this album. The only thing I would like to change in this album is the ballads; there are some good songs on here, but some of them seem to have a kind of "cheap" feel to them.

Amazon review: I first heard Jewel's first album when I was in High School. I was so disappointed that I felt like I had been cheated. The music was ok, but the vocals were flat and the songs were completely forgettable. I had to go to the library to find out that Jewel had a second album out. I was very excited to find that she had returned and now had released another great CD. The sound of the first album is almost identical to the sound of the second, but this time the songs are all unique.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had always heard people say that this album was good, but it just didn't have the quality of the first album. But when I first heard it I thought the songs were ok, but they just weren't the hits that we all know. I had to buy the album, but I can't believe that people are still enjoying this album. It is just not all that good. I think it is a really good album, but I think that it needs to have a few more hits.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the third Jewel album for me. Of course, I love the first one, but I think that this one is a bit on the bad side. I heard that there was a new album out, and I thought that I should hear it. I went to a website that had Jewel albums, and they had Jewel on their list. I decided to go buy it, and I saw that there was a Jewel album out, but I thought, "Where is the Jewel album?" I am so disappointed. I don't know what is going on. Maybe I am just really out of touch.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I thought it was supposed to be Jewel's first album. I didn't really know that it was a Jewel album, so when I came around to the Jewel tour, I was really surprised to see that it was her second album. I am still disappointed, because I wasn't really expecting to find Jewel in a two-disc album. I think that the music is ok, but too many songs are the same. I didn't like "Be My Guest" because I thought that it was too repetitive. "Hollywood" seemed to be a hit because it was the first song that I heard. I remember hearing "If You Leave Me Now" on the radio when I was in high school. I thought it was a great song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
