Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The band's first LP, "The Woods," is an instant classic. It's a heavy, dark, doom record that features Danzig in his prime. The dark and brooding lyrics are often written in a way that makes you wonder why the band wouldn't just shut up. The band members (including Dimebag himself) appear on the record, and they all do a solid job of singing their parts.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I first discovered this band when I was in third grade. I had gotten ahold of the 7-inch "Dimebag" from a local grocery store, and I spent hours listening to it. It has since become one of my favorite albums, and I'm happy to have the privilege of playing it in concert.

Amazon review: Very good album. I have yet to hear the other two albums.  I do have two suggestions for anyone interested in 'Smooth Jazz' music: 1) The first album that I purchased was the one that has the 3rd track on it that has the word 'cougar' in the title.  I don't know, this is a little like the song that they play before the show at the beginning of the band on the Smooth Jazz show.  But this song is a little different than the others on the album.  2) The album that I have received from the artist does not have the first track.  Also, the artist said that there is a mistake on the cover.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been able to add this to my collection - a real keeper.  I have two problems though... the first is that I can't get the download to work - I have tried on three different computers.  The second is that the file is too big (25mb) to fit on my hard drive.  It would be nice if it were possible to download the album in a smaller file size.  I like to listen to my music as I would like to have it.  I would prefer to not have to keep downloading additional songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I just wish I would have bought the cd first.  It would have been so much easier.  The album has all of the things that I wanted, but I would have been stuck with the songs I didn't want.  I also liked that the songs were not arranged to fit a specific type of song.  The songs were a little on the slow side, but when played they sounded just the way I wanted.  Great cd.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A wonderful CD.  I have enjoyed the music very much, but I have found that I don't listen to it as much as I would like to.  I listen to music a little differently than most people.  I prefer to listen to the music in the order in which the songs were presented.  I listened to the CD after a day or two and was surprised to find that I had listened to it many many times over the last week.  I am still listening to it and will probably buy it again.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to new music for the first time.

Amazon review: This CD has been a nice addition to my collection.  I have enjoyed the music very much.  Although I have listened to the cd twice, I have not listened to it often enough to determine if I am enjoying it or not.  I have been told that the cd is a little too slow for the type of songs that I enjoy.  If I could change the cd to a faster speed, I would buy another cd.  The CD is a little expensive for the amount of music on it.  I would rate it a four.  The cd is worth a try, but I would recommend giving it to someone else first.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have an older son, he loves music. He is very musical and sang in the choir. I always listen to him and I always love hearing him sing.  I have a daughter who has never learned to sing, so she is always on the phone. I finally asked her for a CD so I could hear her sing, and she said she would take me to a music store, which she did. I went and bought my son the CD and I will listen to it next week.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I don't believe God is the God of the universe,  I believe God is the only God.  I don't believe that God is in a relationship with the Son,  I believe God is in a relationship with the Father and I don't believe that God is in a relationship with the Son.  Jesus is not God and I don't believe Jesus is God either.  I am a Christian and I do not wish to worship God.  I do not believe in a God,  I do believe in a God and Jesus Christ is a man and a man is not God.  Jesus is not God because God is in a relationship with the Father,  Jesus is not God because God is in a relationship with the Son.

I have been listening to "The Sound of Music" for many years now and even though there are many different interpretations of the same album, I have yet to find one that is worthy of being a part of my collection. I have no idea why I have not heard any other interpretations of the album. I have heard many good albums and many bad albums. I would like to hear other interpretations of this album. I hope this album doesn't fall into the same trap as "The Sound of Music"  It has the same great songs. It is just that I haven't heard them yet.

"Slim Shady" is a great album. It's got all the great Slim Shady tracks and then some other great tracks.
As for the album, it's okay. It sounds good and has a good beat. The beats are a little too slow to be really good, I don't know if they are supposed to slow them down or they're doing it because the rest of the album sounds so fast.
Anyway, the album is good. You'll hear good hip-hop, that's for sure. It's not too bad.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been looking for a CD that has a strong, alternative sound.  I found it in Libera.  It seems to me that there is a great deal more energy on their previous albums.  I have had a lot of problems with this one.  The album is a little too short and the songs aren't as good as the first two albums.  The arrangements are also very similar to the first two albums and are not as well done.  The singing voices are great, but the lyrics are very weak and need to be stronger.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, I was impressed with this album when I first listened to it.  However, after a few listens the songs started to sound a little weak.  The sound track is so full of instrumentation that it takes you for a ride and I found myself singing along to the music, but I am still stuck on the fact that I am not totally satisfied with the album.  The only songs I would recommend are "Hangin'" and "I Love You, Goodbye."  The rest of the songs are either forgettable or boring to me.  I wish I could rate the entire album better than a 2.  I would recommend this CD to people who would like to listen to a good, alternative sound.  Some of the songs are very well done and some are a little weak.

Amazon review: The album has a lot of variety and I loved the mix of styles (rock, country, folk, blues, classical).    I am amazed that this group has already reached such a large audience.

I am a sucker for good music and for the first time in my life, I have found an album that completely entices me.    I don't think I will ever try another album by this group.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Not being biased, I do not think that this album is a great one, but I cannot find any flaws in this album.

Amazon review:  I love John Coltrane's "A Love Supreme."  I would have to say that it is his most accessible album.  He is doing something that most musicians would never dream of doing.  He is breaking down the barriers and he is creating something new.  I think he is doing a good job.  I love his style and I love the new sound he is developing.

Amazon review:  I have always loved John Coltrane's music.  This is the first album I have ever bought on vinyl, so that makes it the first time I have ever bought an LP.  I was looking for something different for my collection and I found this album in a record store.  I have been listening to it non-stop since I got it.  I love the way the drums sound.  I love the way the vocals sound.  The guitar solo on "The Mystery of Chessman" is amazing.  So many people tell me that I have to buy this album.  I have been playing it non-stop for 3 days straight.  It is the best album I have ever heard.  The music is amazing and it is just great to sing along with.  The lyrics work really well with the music and there is not a weak song on the album.  The album is just perfect.  I am very happy.  Thank you John Coltrane for sharing your music with the world.

Amazon review:  Wow, this album is great!  I had never heard "You'll Never Walk Alone" before, but I've always had a deep love of music.  I listened to this album on the way home from work and I thought it was just fabulous.  It took me a while to get into it, but once I did, I just couldn't stop playing it.  I love the way the guitar solo on "The Mystery of Chessman" sounds, the drums and the vocals all sound great together.  I really like the guitar solo on "The Mystery of Chessman."  The lyrics on the album are great, and really relate to the music.  The album is really well done.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: They say "If you're not one of the people who will do anything for the Lord" - you're not one of the people.  The songs need to be sung by someone who is a real singer.  I'm not even sure that the singers are from the band.  They seem to be singing along with canned lyrics and it's a real mess.  I'm not a fan of the band.  I don't like the sound of this album.  But, I have to say it was worth listening to for a couple of songs.  I'm sure it would be better if they started over.  All in all, I don't recommend the album, but I wouldn't steer away from it if it was a gift to someone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid's first album, 'Twiztid', is a mess.  The vocals are poor, the lyrics are poor, and the songs are poor.  The album is mostly filled with songs about being a dick.  It's a shame they didn't finish the album or do something different.  If they had, I would have been more than happy to buy the album.
Sentiment: Mixed
###
Amazon review: The songs are not bad or anything,  the lyrics are very good,  the music is quite good, but the vocals are just atrocious.  Even with the bad vocals and the bad music, I still enjoyed this album.  I don't know what is going on with Twiztid,  they have become so inconsistent.  They don't have the same song every time,  they do the same song every time with different lyrics,  and they do the same song in a different style.  They should just stop, and make one good album and one bad album.  They are a real shame.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love Twiztid. That's why I am so upset with this album.  I don't see why they couldn't have made one album good and one album bad.  It's like they try to do a full album and then do one song two times and another song three times.  It doesn't work.  What happens is they do a song that is good, or they do a song that is bad.  They just don't know how to go back and forth between songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am so disappointed in this CD.  This is the best they have done.  They had a great album on there,  then they changed it up.  Now they are back to what we are used to.  Every song is about some type of dick.  The only good song is "Twisted."  The only bad song is "Honey Bunch."  I really wanted to like this CD, it's just not good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is awful.  It feels like they just added a bunch of songs to the CD.  It's like they had a bunch of songs that should have been on the CD and then they added a bunch of new songs.  The CD comes with just some of the songs and the lyrics.  They didn't even give us the song list.  It's like they made a new CD and then they changed it to their own song list or what ever.  It just doesn't seem like they are that interested in creating a good, quality product.  The lyrics are terrible,  the music is good, but the vocals are terrible.  The lyrics are just written like if you were going to write a song,  it would be about a bitch and a hoe.  They should have just cut the whole album.  It's just a waste of time to listen to this crap.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a feeling that this is a CD Twiztid trying to get back to their original sound.  The first 4 songs are all about dick talking,  then they have a song about how a bitch is not a hoe and a song about a guy being a hoe.  I don't like any of the songs,  but it's interesting to listen to Twiztid's new attempt at being Twiztid.  It's just another attempt by Twiztid at trying to be Twiztid.  The vocals are horrible.  I don't like any of the songs.  The only good song is "Twisted."  The only song I like is "Honey Bunch."  I would like to see them get back to their original sound.  I just don't think they are going to.  I hate hearing this music.  I really hate it.  I wish they would

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I love the new songs here.  The last song I heard was "Lose My Breath" and I was really happy.  I really need to hear the rest of the songs.

Amazon review: I love Meghan Trainor and the songs on this album.  The only thing I don't like about this CD is the cover. I don't like the way she is dressed and I don't like the way she talks.

She is very talented and I hope she keeps writing good songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Not a good album in the least bit.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

But this album is just awful. It sounds like there are 2 Twiztids in this album, and the rest just sound like average rappers.  The best song is the last song "I'm Not Dead Yet" but that song is just over 2 hours long. And you know some people would get bored of that song. I mean it is the longest song in the CD.  So I am surprised that this CD does not have like 2 or 3 songs that are the best songs on the CD.

The "I'm Not Dead Yet" song is like a 2:30 song, but the song that was on this CD is like a 1:30 song, so I guess that's why they didn't put the 1:30 song.

I love these guys, I love "I'm Not Dead Yet" and I want to like the second song "Just a Kid" because it is by a different artist, but it is a good song.
