Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

My favorite Billy Joel songs are "New York State of Mind" and "A Hundred Days".  I didn't like the music on this album.  I was hoping that it would be a little more different. I thought maybe that it would sound a little more like the "Greatest Hits" album, but it wasn't. I really wish that it was better.  I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone.

The music was good, but the lyrics were not.  When I say lyrics, I mean the song lyrics.  They were just the same as the songs, and not so good.  The songs were very similar to the songs on the "Greatest Hits" album, except for the fact that they were more upbeat and had a lot more riffs in them.  The songs on the album sounded like their were not taken from the "Greatest Hits" album.  I felt like they were very different.  All songs have an original story and the music was very nice.

Amazon review: This song is just too good to be left on the radio. The song was written by a man who is currently serving time in prison. He was writing a song for his wife, and his wife really loved the song, so he went to prison, and wrote the song for her. He is going to play the song at his wife's funeral, and wants you to know that he is doing it for her, and he hopes that you will listen to it. He will talk about her a lot, but he wants people to keep listening to the song, and that they will be inspired to do good things.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I don't have an opinion on the music, but I have a lot of opinions about the movie. I was appalled at how young she was. There was no reason for her to be this way. It was shocking to see her have to be put in the hospital. I am not sure what the big deal is about drugs, but I guess it must be because she was a child and had no control of her life. So, I am glad she is now on a good treatment plan, but it's a shame to see someone that young have to be put in a home. Her home was a home, she had a family, her parents were there for her during her treatment, so to watch her go through it all and not be able to be around her family, is a hard thing to watch. I thought it was sad that she was just a kid and she had cancer, and she was so young. It was very hard to watch her go through it all. It was very sad. I don't know what happened to her. I don't really know what to say about the movie, because it was so horrible. I don't usually watch a movie unless it's an award-winning movie, and I don't think that can be said for this movie. I was surprised that it was made, because I thought it was made for entertainment purposes and not to help the people who were touched by her story. I am glad that people will see it, and that it has done something to help her, but it was very sad to see.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say except that I think this is a wonderful music collection. I believe that is why I bought it. I have always loved classical music, and I think it's really cool that they have so many pieces of music on there. I can only assume that there are hundreds of different artists on there, and I have only found one or two of each artist before (just because I haven't purchased all of their albums). I wish I could say that this was one of the best records I have ever purchased, but I can't. I am glad that it is on Amazon, at least there is a way of purchasing it, and if you don't like it you can return it. I am also glad that I ordered this. I hope you enjoy it!

Amazon review: I really liked this album. I wasn't aware of all the details, because I was not familiar with the artist (or the composer) until after I bought this album. I'm sorry, but I must say that I did not like this album. I listened to it a lot, and it was a great collection of classical music, most of which I had never heard before. But, I had to say that I did not enjoy the music. I didn't like the sound of the music at all. The music was too loud, and the sound was too clear. The sound was so clear, I could tell that the musician was singing. He sang with a "high" voice, which is really annoying to me. He sang in a high pitched voice, which I think can get annoying, especially if you are a musician. The singer sang in a high pitched voice, and he was also too loud. If you are a musician, you don't need to be so loud, because you are not in a nightclub. The sound that you are making is not going to make anyone run up and hug you. But, I really liked this album. You need to buy all of the albums, because there is a lot of great music in here.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

###
Amazon review: This CD is the first of a three disc set. I find it hard to review this as this is one of those albums that have been reviewed many times or even written about but I have never heard them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The CD is well done, and the band plays with a lot of intensity, but the music is a bit too fast and loud for my tastes. I found the lyrics boring, and although they are written in a very poetic way, the music and lyrics are not very interesting. I did like the first cd, but the band members don't play together, so I would have loved to hear them all play together.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not bad. The songs are in no particular order, but they have a nice feel to them. The production could be a little more polished. I think the band would have done better if they had played more songs together (instead of just playing one at a time). The CD is also a bit short. I would like to have it in 4 parts, with the entire CD in the beginning.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been waiting for this CD for almost 2 years. I bought this CD in 2002. I am not going to buy another CD from this band until they give me a CD with less errors and more interesting tunes. The CD is not a live performance but a studio recording. The CD contains two songs, and the guitar solos are very good. I am not a fan of the songs, but the solos are good. I do not like the band's music at all. There are no real musicians in their music. I hope they put more people on stage. They can always use some more singers.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Well, this is a CD that doesn't really work for me. The album is good, but it's too long. The vocals aren't the best, but the guitars are good.

Amazon review: This is supposed to be the CD that Ry Cooder is best known for. This CD is a good listen, but it could have been longer. The vocals are the best, but the melodies are not that good. The guitar sounds great, but the melodies are all too fast. I would like to hear more from this band.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is the worst Killers album since the last one.  I have never disliked a Killers album, and this is the first since 2004 and it has been almost a decade since then.  I found this album to be boring.  I think it is a good record with the right intentions, but that is it.  I am not happy with the album.  I was looking forward to a much better Killers record.  I have been a fan since 2004.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I found this album to be extremely boring. I would have expected more from the Killers, but I was not.  The second half of the album was way too repetitive.  I felt the album stopped being fun at around the 3-4 minute mark.  The album could have been 10 or 15 songs, but 2-3 songs are not enough to keep my interest.  I could not bring myself to listen to the whole album.

Amazon review: I did not like this album.  I was surprised by some of the things I did not like.  I don't know if this was intentional, but they had way too many songs that were just too much of the same with no new ideas.  They had a lot of filler songs that did not really have anything to do with the album or even the Killers.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think they are getting better at the Killers and they will become "all star" when they make their next album.  I am happy about this because it is the first Killers album since 2004 and I am glad I got it.  I don't know why I don't like this album.  Not really sure why I don't like it.  I think they put out a good album.  I think they have a lot of potential after this.  I am glad I got this album.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: Timeless lyrics and music for anyone who has Loved and Lost. basically, all of us just about.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this, I thought it was a really interesting album. I would have liked to have been able to listen to it more often. I think that in many ways this album stands up to the others. The melody and lyrics are quite interesting and the voice of the female can be compared with the voices of Celine Dion, Sheryl Crow, Whitney Houston.

Amazon review: This album has a lot of good songs. There are a couple of weak songs, but the songs that have a lot of energy are great. It's really like listening to a lot of different artists at the same time. There are a few songs that stand out as being better or better versions of the originals, but overall this thing is a great listen.
