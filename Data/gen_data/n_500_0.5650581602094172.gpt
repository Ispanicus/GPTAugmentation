Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I love the song "If God can give, He can take away"  One of the most positive songs on the album.  The only song I did not like was the "Farewell"  It was kind of cheesy and sounded like it was written by someone from the 80's.

Amazon review: I had to stop listening to this CD because of all the songs I was listening to just kept repeating themselves.  I really don't think it was their fault.  I don't think they were trying to be corny.  I think they were just trying to be honest.  I think that's what makes the album so refreshing.  This is the first album I've heard where I have a lot of faith and love in the people that are singing.  I also really like the message.  I would have liked more of the gospel songs but I love the message and the songs.

Amazon review: Oh yeah, you can throw this CD in your car and listen to it while you drive, and when you get home, you'll have no idea that you ever listened to it.

The rest are complete garbage.  I would rate this album lower than a third grade report card.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought.

Amazon review: Well, I have seen the movie "The Passion of the Christ" and I was fascinated by the music. It got me to thinking about how the passion songs are actually just a way to show God's love to the world. In the movie, they use church music to show the passion. I don't think they are using real church music. I believe that they are really showing the passion and the way that God loves.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: A great album, with so many great songs, I was disappointed when I noticed that it was released in the mid-1990s. The songs are great, but I'd love to know more about the person who wrote these songs.  It was a great album, so I'm not sure there'd be much interest in the album's legacy, unless someone came out with a CD with the entire 12-album catalog.  My only complaint is that the tracks seem to have been remixed in the past.

Amazon review: I've always found the best music to be from the 'alternative' label, so I have always enjoyed albums like this.  It's a fun, upbeat, good-time kind of music - sort of like '80s Top 40 - but with a more laid-back feeling.  Enjoy!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is a fun read, but I found it a bit too light to be of much interest.  The songs are fun, and although the album was released in the early 1990s, at least three of the songs were composed around the early 1980s.  The lyrics are fun, but could be more descriptive of the music, and I think they are.  The song "Trouble" is actually the best song on the album, for the most part.  As for the rest of the songs, I don't understand the lyrics, and don't understand why they sound like they were written by a group of monkeys.  I'm not sure why the band sounds so different from the original recording.  I would have liked to have heard more of the original recording - but this is probably the best I could do.  Enjoy!

Amazon review: Very good collection, with a lot of good songs.  I'm not a huge fan of the original version, but the newer version still has a lot of good songs.

Amazon review:"The music of the band has always been in the background to my life.  I have a couple of songs in my set lists, and that's what happens when you're trying to keep life in the background.  I don't think the original version is nearly as good as this album.  I find the newer version to be the better one.  The songs are fun, and the lyrics are very descriptive.  It's a great album that people should have on their list of'must have' albums.  Enjoy!"

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for the past few months.  I find that the music is very relaxing, and I really enjoy the fact that it is non-stop.  It is very easy to dance to at times.  I don't know what it is about this song that I just can't get into it.  I would have to say, most of the time it is very relaxing.  The only problem is that it is not very long.  I know that the song is long, but it is getting a bit boring.  I am going to try to get the song over with.  I have had to listen to it several times because of the length.  Overall, I really enjoy this CD.  I think that it is a great gift for anyone that loves music and relaxation.  This is a very good CD to purchase.  It is definitely something I wouldn't put on my iPod.  I would suggest that you only buy this CD if you know the recipient likes music.  If you are buying this for someone who just likes music, then I would highly recommend this.

The song selection is fine, however, the song selection is just not very good.  I can't recommend this CD to anyone.  If you enjoy music and the slow groove, pick this CD up.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I'm old enough to remember the time when they were huge, before the grunge boom.  I don't care about the current music.  I don't listen to any of the current music.  I'm not saying that I never liked the new stuff but I don't like it and I don't listen to it.  But I know for a fact that the Dolls were huge when they first came out.  I remember when they were huge, I was only little then but I remember as a kid they were huge.  They were huge, I was in junior high.  I'm old enough to remember when the Dolls were huge but the people who are in the business are not old enough to remember it.  The only way you can be a Doll is if you're a total idiot.  They were big, they were loud, they were raw and they were very different.  They were a huge influence on the New York Dolls.  They were just another band to me.  I don't know what the current generation thinks of the Dolls, but I don't like to be put in that category.  I don't care what the current music is.  I don't care what the current music is.

Amazon review: This is a very pleasant CD, although it does have a few things that may make it a little less than what you really want to hear:
1) The CD is in stereo, so you'll get a little more of the vocals than you would if it were in mono (as I would expect it to be).
2) The vocals in this particular song are a little loud.
3) The guitar riffs are a little too fast and/or too long.
4) The bass is a little too heavy.
5) The drums are a little too heavy.
6) The guitar solo is a little too short and/or doesn't have the intensity of the guitar solo in the first song.

The first track is "I love you," which is a duet by the Zac Brown Band members.  It's a pretty good song, but with the title, I expected something more than a simple duet.  The second track is "Our Song."  I thought this was a simple song, but the Zac Brown Band members do a good job singing it.  I believe the Zac Brown Band has a good song, but that's about it.  There is no country in this album.  The Zac Brown Band members are talented, but I don't think they have anything good to say.  I was expecting a good album, but this album is terrible.

Song of the Day
###
The Beatles were always ahead of their time, and this was the first time a song that had been written by someone else was made into a hit record.  This was their first recording of a song that was written and recorded by the other Beatles.  The other three songs were "Can't Buy Me Love," "I Want to Hold Your Hand," and "Please Please Me."  These four songs were intended to be part of a group song that had been called "The Beatles' Second Album," but it was finally called "A Hard Day's Night."  All four songs were recorded by EMI on January 7, 1964.  The song was released on the 10th of January, and was the beginning of a series of hits that would come during the Beatles' early, great careers.  The song was written by Ron Geeslin, who later wrote numerous other songs for the Beatles, including "I Feel Fine."  The song was produced by George Martin and is credited to George Martin and Norman Smith.  The first verse of the song is sung by George.  The next verse is sung by George and the rest of the band except for Ringo and John, who are not in the picture.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.
