Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this group.  The music is great.  The singing is even better.  They have a few other CDs but I do not own any of them. They make some great videos and have a website with a ton of information.  But the music...oh the music...

Amazon review: This cd should be in everyones collection.  The music is very good and I have never heard better. The vocals are very good too.  The best thing about this cd is the quality of the instruments.  You can tell how much they care about the music.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  I like the fact that it is a live CD and not just a studio CD.  I know of one other live album that I have and the quality of the recording is not as good as this one.  The vocalist is very good.  I wish I could give you the CD that I have but it is from a demo CD and I don't have the other CDs that they are on.  I would like to see more of their music.

Amazon review: I just purchased this cd and have listened to it multiple times.  I like this band.  They are very professional.  Their CD is very well produced.  The songs are very strong.  I have a feeling that I will enjoy this cd when it is released.  This is a very good cd.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Fine voice; SAME FOUR CHORDS OVER AND OVER. Get some originality.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: No originality, nothing, just a few mediocre songs with a few not so mediocre songs thrown in.  Maybe he's trying to make money off his CD sales and maybe it is not working.  If he can make it on the radio or whatever and get his music out in general, then he should be fine, but we don't need to see it all the time, we need to see more originality, more creativity, more soul, more emotion, more passion.  But the songs on this CD are all the same, just the same 4 chords over and over.  Same 4 chords over and over.  It's just a bad CD.  I give it a C.  I will not buy it.  And I will not recommend it either.  It's just a bad album.

Amazon review: I don't have a problem with Bob Johnson.  I do have a problem with the CD but it is not something that I can take offense at.  There are good songs on this album.  There are good songs that I would like to see more of.  But there really isn't anything special about this CD that would bring back memories of my childhood.  And I certainly don't recall much about living in the late 60's or early 70's.  So I can't say that I'm sad about the CD at all.  I'm not going to buy it.  I'm not going to recommend it.  I'll let others decide.

I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to put up a positive review. I do not like the CD, I will not buy it (but I will give it to a friend).

I don't like this album, I don't like any of the songs on this album.

I was hoping to get something like this.  But I could not find it!  I think the song "Don't Need You" is the best on here, but that is not saying much, so many bland songs on here.  You would think at least two or three would be good, but unfortunately, nope, just not enough of anything.

I don't understand why they could not come up with something original, I mean, they could have just come up with a bunch of good songs and put them on this album, it would have been more original, and I think that would have been better.

I don't understand why they could not come up with a good song list.  They could have just come up with a bunch of good tracks and put them on this album, it would have been more original, but they didn't.

I don't understand why they could not come up with originality and creativity, there are some good songs on this album, but no originality or creativity, just the same songs over and over.  I don't

Amazon review: This is a very nice song. But for a first release this is the best thing I have heard in a long time.  Not sure what I expected.  Maybe I was just thinking about the song.  But, I thought Bob would use the line: "This is what I like about you, you know I love you like a brother."  This isn't the way it is.  The song has a good message, but it didn't get me.  I liked it, but it didn't have me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've listened to a few Bob Johnson songs, and this one is my favorite.  It is a very easy story, and he is able to get to the point.  I like the fact that he isn't looking for anything.  He is just telling a story.  The message is there, but you don't hear it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the harmony.  I am not a big fan of the vocals, but I like how he makes it so he is even singing it.  I like how the lyrics don't really have any rhyme or reason.  I don't know if that is because of the song or the person singing the lyrics.  I don't care, I like to hear different things.  I like that he is telling a story about how the world goes on after the end of the world.  I just don't think it's the best thing to say on his first release.  I think he should have put it on his second.  But, that's just me.  I think he could do better with his next album.

This is a pretty great album, I have enjoyed it. It has some good lyrics and music. The only thing that I can think of is that the vocals are not that good. I can actually hear them during the chorus part, and one of the singers is a little too high in the range for me, but I can hear what he is singing. Not a big deal though.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of the songs from a group called "The Great Big Big Band."  The songs are all original written by the group. Not a lot of musicians that play the same instrument can play them all.  The drummer on each song is a different person.  Some are drummers and some are keyboard players.  The vocals are all different.  I'd say I like this CD a lot better than some of their other work.

I have a new computer and I did a clean install of Windows 7, After the install I tried to put my dvd drive into the laptop and I get no sound from the dvd player. I have no idea what I did wrong, I have tried many things to fix it but it is still no sound. I thought maybe it was because I had my dvd player in a docking thing, I have since moved it to a different spot and I'm still having no sound. Is there any way I can fix this?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the music of Johnny Cash. I grew up listening to his music and watching his films. He is my hero. He is one of the greatest singers to ever live. This CD, however is not up to his standard. It could have been great, but was not. I bought this CD because it was my first time hearing Cash, but I did not like what I heard. If you are a fan of Cash or even a casual fan, then I suggest you download the CD, but it is not worth buying and listening to.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I have not listened to this cd's full length yet,  but the songs are all very good.  I did listen to the first song and was pleased.  The first song (Ave Maria) has a different tempo and different feel from the other songs.  The second song (Holy Spirit) has some nice piano pieces and a nice guitar line.  The guitar solo is very nice.  The songs are all very good and have very positive messages.  The best CD I have seen for a while.

The only thing that really annoyed me is the fact that the songs are all titled the same. Each track is entitled "I Don't Wanna Know" or "I Don't Wanna Know" or "I Don't Wana Know" and the songs themselves are pretty much the same. If I would have noticed this before buying this album, I would have not bought it and I'd have been the winner.

Amazon reviews: I think this album is average.

This is one of my favorite albums of all time, but not one of my favorite Eminem albums. This album is a better than expected return to the form that made him famous, but does not rise to the level of his past albums.

This is one of my favorite albums of all time, and it is an excellent album. This is his best work since the early 2000's. He has a new sound and he's more confident in his ability to write and sing songs, which I really like.

This is an excellent album. I really like the songwriting and his confidence. The production is really great as well. I would recommend this to any fan of the genre.

This is my favorite album by Eminem. I love his music. I would recommend this album to any fan of the genre. I would also recommend it to anyone who likes Eminem's older work just because of the changes.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  It wasn't worth the money.  The song 'You are the Love of My Life" was very nice but the other songs were not.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for about 2 weeks and I have never been more offended by a CD before.  I bought this CD because my grand daughter loves to sing and I thought it would be a nice Christmas gift for her.  It is a CD full of songs that I believe are sung to the God of the Bible.  I am a Christian and this CD is supposed to be sung to God.  I am not a fan of the lyrics or songs.  I have my own family and love them.  I really don't like the messages and themes in this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the CD that God has given me for my Christmas gift.  I listened to the song 'Jesus Loves Me' and it made me cry.  I love the message.

This song is very similar to 'Jesus Loves Me' and I know I will not be singing this CD to my children or grand children.  I will not give this CD to anyone.
