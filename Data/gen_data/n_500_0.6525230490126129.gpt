Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I am a person who loves to watch all types of video games. The only video game I have played since I was a teenager was a version of Donkey Kong, and it was a terrible game. It was fun, but the controls were terrible. When I first started playing Super Mario Bros. 3, I thought it was going to be a fun game. It was fun, but the game had terrible controls, and I found it difficult. I thought to myself, "I could actually like this game. I will actually like this game." So I bought it. Now, I don't have the best computer, and I didn't read the manual properly, but I played this game with a friend, and we really, really liked it.

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

I've always liked the Beatles, but I never ever expected their music to be this boring!

I like the Beatles, but most of their music is extremely boring, and this album is no exception. I'm going to give it a two out of five, but only because it's a good value.

The woman told me that she could not do that and that I could only have the music shipped back to me and that she would have to send it back to the customer who had originally sent it to me.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

I'm so sorry to say that this album is going to be a little short in the details of the music that I'm going to give you.
It is short because I just want to give you a little taste of the album to give you a good idea of how this album is going to sound. The album is going to be about 20 songs of mostly songs that I enjoy with a couple of that I don't like.
I hope you enjoy the album.

When I heard that the new Carina Round album will be released in November I jumped on it with my heart. I love the sound of Carina Round and I love the way she sings. I've been a huge fan for a long time. I just wish it was longer.

This is not the album that I thought I was going to get. I'm just happy that it's out there. I love all of the albums that Carina has put out and I'm so happy that she is back.

I would say that this album has a perfect balance of songs that I love and songs that I don't love. I love songs that are well written with a great melody and I love songs that I don't really like at all.

This album is full of different styles of songs with different things to say. It's full of different styles of songs with different things to say. I love the pop rock sound, but I really enjoyed the rock, pop rock, and 80's pop rock type

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

They are all drunk.  The guy that writes the songs is always drunk.  There are no clean voices in this band.  Every band is terrible.  I can't believe that there is so much good music but this band is terrible.  I wish they would go away so I could get the clean voice in this band.  They are definitely not worth listening to.  I am a big fan of this band and I have heard a lot of good songs from them but there is nothing for me here.  I am a huge fan of this band and I am glad that I have the CD but I would rather get the clean voice.  Also they have no fans or anyone to talk to.  I am sure lots of people are very sad that the band does not give any fans and no one to talk to.  I have heard the band many times and they are very good, but for some reason I have never been able to buy this CD except for this review.  I love this band and I would really like to see them again, but I am not sure they deserve a single star.  This is the lowest of the lowest, a one star.  This is the worst CD I have ever heard.  This band is so bad that I can't believe anyone has a clean singing voice.  I have never heard such bad music.  This CD is the absolute worst I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to this album.  I was hoping I would like it, but I could not get into it.  I know I have listened to the album before, but I don't remember where.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I have listened to it many times, and I have not listened to it in a week.  I was looking for a little more of a country sound.  The songs are great.  I bought this album before I realized that I'm so old I can't understand the lyrics.  At least that is what I think is the reason why I can't understand the lyrics on this album.  I am not sure if I will be able to get it out of my collection and listen to it.  I can understand the music, but I did like the album and now I am not sure if I will get it.  I hope I will, but that may be a little too late.

I love the cover art and the music, but I did not like the lyrics on this album.  I wanted to hear the lyrics but I just couldn't understand them at the time.  I have now listened to this album a couple of times, and I am really loving it.  I just think it is a shame that there is no lyrics on the album.  For all your listening pleasure, I hope there is a little more information on this album.  I like the album, and I know a lot of people will be happy to see that this album has a better track list then most albums.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: As a little girl growing up in the '60s, this was one of my absolute favorite albums. When I heard it I loved the music and I loved the lyrics and the album itself was just a blast. I know it's not a "classical" song, but it's actually very catchy and I think the lyrics of the song is very true to life. I just wish that there was more of a chorus in the song, and the song was a little bit smoother in the guitar solo I think that the guitar solo is a little bit better on this version of the song, and the song seems to be a little bit more powerful and the guitar solo of this version of the song is a little bit better than the original version of the song. The only thing that I can really complain about is that it didn't have enough guitar solos in the song, but I think that that's just a minor complaint.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

Amazon review: Nancy Sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault!  She should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon.

Amazon review: It's a sad day for country music fans when the only thing that's available from this great artist is a compilation of her worst hits!  If you're looking for a real country music artist, try a different genre or country artist.  I still like this song, but not as much as I used to.
