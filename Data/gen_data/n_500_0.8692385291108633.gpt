Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: Not only is she a horrible singer.  She supports cop killers.  She is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video.  Please do not support her!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: For those of you who don't know her, she sings a lot of traditional ballads.  This song, "I'll Be There", is one of her favorites.  It's a pretty simple song with a simple but powerful message.  The video is okay but it doesn't do anything to sell the song.  It makes me think it is a fluke that it made the list.  She is very talented, and I am glad she decided to pursue a career in music.

Amazon review: As a former member of American Idol, this song got me into her music.  She sings in a completely different style than she does on The Voice.  It's a more mature, mature style.  The song is upbeat, full of energy and a great message.  There's nothing out of this world about it.  It's like a fun dance party song.  It is the perfect song to get you in the mood for a party.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review:  I love the song, but I couldn't find the lyrics for the chorus.  But I have found them, but they are in a different order than the version on YouTube.  So I guess the YouTube version is correct. I like it!  I like the way it moves around.  I like the way the guitars come in at the chorus.  I like the way it ends.  And I like how it sounds when it moves or when it starts.

Amazon review: I think the first line is a little cheesy, but this is the only version of the song that I could find with the video of the original.  I really love this song.  This is one of those songs I can dance to.  I would like to find more videos of this song, and I'm sure that there are more versions of the song that are out there.  But I have no idea where to look!  I don't know if I can find this song anywhere.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure of the origins of this song. I believe it is from the early days of the Beatles, when John Lennon was getting started with his group. I'm still trying to figure it out but I like it and it's on the album, which I love, but I'd really like to know how the guy that recorded it came up with the name "Sly & the Family Stone".

Amazon review: As I listen to this, the more I like it. I'm not sure if I like it better as an instrumental, but it's a great song. I like the opening, the beat, and the intro is really cool. The solo is cool too. The chorus sounds like something that could be on a song by the Beatles. I like the verses, they are really cool. The ending is really cool too. The only problem is that the song is really short for me. I feel like the verses and chorus are a little too long for me to have time to really enjoy the whole song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is great, and it's really catchy.  But I have a problem with the way the chorus is sung. It sounds like a song that was written by a child.  I'm a little annoyed by the way  the chorus is sung.  I would have expected the chorus to be sung by an adult, as they are the ones that are singing it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the song, but the lyrics don't make sense to me. The song starts out with two different guys singing a verse, then one of them starts singing the chorus, then the other one starts singing the verse. Then they go back and forth singing the chorus until the two guys sing it together. Then they go back and forth singing the verses again. I don't know if it happens because the two are going back and forth, or if it's because they're singing the verses backwards.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good song! It is very catchy and well-written. I like the way the song ends, but I don't know if I like the song as a whole. This is my second time listening to this song. I like it better than the first time. The first time I listened to it, I didn't really like it. But now I do. I don't think it is a real song, though. I think it is more of a rap. I think I like it better as a rap.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This song is awesome. I'm not a huge fan of Three Days Grace, but this is by far my favorite.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good heavy band. I love the early, heavy stuff from the 80s, when bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Slayer, and even Ozzy all ruled the metal landscape. And then there's Black Sabbath who were always my favorite heavy metal band (even though they're not my favorite metal band).

Amazon review: I know some people will say this is the worst album in the history of human beings, and I'll tell them to go to hell. But seriously, I know the worst album in the history of human beings is the album I just listened to. And to be honest, I'm not 100% sure I've heard worse albums. I'll leave it at that.

Amazon review: I have a friend who has a very old album where he's playing a guitar solo where he hits certain notes and then just kind of holds the note, and it sounds really bad. He's like, "I'm like, 'Man, that is the worst guitar solo I've ever heard in my life!'"

Amazon review: No, this is not a real review, but it's very interesting to hear this album and see how others feel.

Amazon review: I think this album is horrible. I really do. I really wish I got this album for free. It's a pretty bad album, but I'm not sure why. I feel bad for the person who made it. I feel bad for the person who bought it because they'll probably listen to it a few times and then never hear it again. Then they'll go to a friend's house who's a big Korn fan and they'll play this album and they'll be like, "Why is this the worst Korn album?" And then they'll play it a few more times and just go, "It's the worst Korn album." And then they'll listen to it a few more times and go, "Why is this the worst Korn album?" And then they might buy it, and then they'll go to a friend who's a big Korn fan and they'll listen to this album and they'll go, "Why is this the worst Korn album?" And then the friend will go on and on and they'll listen to it a couple more times and then they'll say, "This is the worst Korn album ever." And then they'll never listen to it again. And they're now one of the best Korn fans in the world. And they're not going to listen to this album again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have an 11 year old daughter, so I've been listening to a lot of Korn over the past few years. I was looking for an album that would be suitable for her, but I thought the usual Korn album would be too heavy. Then I thought about this album and I was like, "I can't believe they made this." This is a little bit more mellow, not as heavy as some of the previous Korn albums, but still heavy enough for us older Korn fans.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album in a long time, so I must say I am not a huge fan of this album. I really like the first two albums, but this is not as good. I don't find this album to be as good as the first two.

Amazon review: I was looking at this album and I thought "Wow, this is a really good album." Then I listened to it and I was like "Wow, this is a really bad album." And then I heard the song, "Cripple," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS A BAD ALBUM." Then I heard the song, "Breathe," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS REALLY BAD." Then I heard the song, "You and Me," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS A REALLY BAD ALBUM." But then I heard the song, "Sick Again," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ALBUM." Then I heard the song, "No Surprises," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS A REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD ALBUM." Then I heard the song, "Black Rain," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS A REALLY GREAT ALBUM." Then I heard the song, "We're in This Together," and I was like, "WOW, THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM." Then I heard the song, "Carry on," and I was like, "WOW

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I would give this one a 5 (out of 10) rating.  This is a pretty good album.  But then, I'm a sucker for country.  I don't know why.  I just love it.  I can't even listen to most of the other albums on here because my kids would not know what the hell I was saying.  This album is about a group of friends who get together for a night of drinking and singing.  They get high on the alcohol and the singing.  I guess if you don't like it...  I guess you should go to hell.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was the last album I bought after my divorce.  I only bought it cause I couldn't stand her singing any other songs that I had bought from her.  I have always liked the voice of her.  But this was the last album I bought that she sang on.  I don't know why I bought it cause I didn't like it but it just was a nice album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a nice album.  The singing is a little rough and the songs are not really upbeat.  This was the last album I bought.  I don't know why, she makes a good album but there are songs I don't like.  I don't know why I bought it cause I didn't know her.  I wouldn't buy this again.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Natalie Cole for over 3 years now.  I have bought her albums and listened to them almost all the time.  I just realized that I don't even know who she is.  She made so many great albums.  I love her voice.  Her songs are so deep and sincere.  I am so sorry that she is no longer with us.  I hope she was in heaven.  I'll never forget the day I saw her on the stage at the Apollo.  She was so beautiful and graceful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good record, but not a great one.  The songs on it are not exactly good.  The first few songs were very sweet.  They have some good songs on there but nothing spectacular.  The songs don't sound like the originals.  It's a good album for a first timer, but I don't think it will ever have the longevity of her earlier albums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was so excited to hear this album when I first got it.  I liked her voice and the songs were good.  I was really upset when they decided to put out this album and not a new one.  I have always liked the songs that she has made, but I don't understand why they decided to start a new series of albums.  I was so upset because I really liked this album.  I think it has something to do with the different voices on the album, I think.  I don't know why she stopped making albums, but this album is good.

I called the store back and they said they would get someone to listen to the music and get back to me. I called them back a few more times but they never got back to me.

I called back and I was told that I couldn't get a new copy until after the weekend. So I waited the weekend and no one called me back.

I called them again and they said they just got all the songs on the CD. After that, I couldn't get them to listen to my situation. I told them everything that happened and they were not going to talk to me. I told them how I am a single parent and they told me that I shouldn't be calling them. They don't care about me and my kids. They just want to make money off the CD. They are just trying to make money off my money and I am not going to support them. I don't even want to support them and I don't really want to give them my money.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This is a good album for fans of the old school.  The title track is a cover of a song by The Monkees, which I think is a great song.  The other songs I like are the covers of Billy Joel and Marvin Gaye. However, the production of this CD doesn't really bring it.  The vocals are good so there is a lot of energy, but none of the tracks really flow well.

Amazon review: This is the official soundtrack to the movie "Beverly Hills Cop II."  Well, it is.  I had a CD from the movie "Beverly Hills Cop III" but I didn't get it.  The only reason I bought this album was because I thought it would sound good.  What I got were the songs from the movie with a few of the songs from the movie's soundtrack.  Very few of the songs are good, like "Cop II" or "I Still Know Him" or "Rent-a-Cop."  Other than that, I'm not impressed with this album.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review:  I'm a big fan of Miley Cyrus and I don't think much of her.  I don't really listen to her music, but when I go to her concerts they are always very annoying and predictable.  I don't know if I have anything positive to say about this song, but it has a nice melody that I like.  I don't know what the "i" stands for, but the song sounds to me like it's about a girl who is very in love with you.  It has a very cute chorus, but it's kinda annoying when the chorus repeats itself.  Like, the chorus repeats itself until the very end of the song.  And the song ends with the line, "See you again."  I don't know if I have anything positive to say.
