Amazon review: Sample tracks sounded great, but when you listen to the entire CD it's one monotonous song after another.  Had high hopes for this, but was pretty much disappointed in the tunes.  Probably will give it away if I can find someone who wants it.

Amazon review: Most of these are only portions of the songs, such as 1 verse and the chorus.  I would prefer the entire song.  Also, many are done with a "country feel" to them, not the traditional music you would hear in church.  I downloaded it to have songs for senior citizens to sing along with, and it isn't a hit.  Was glad I downloaded it from amazon though as i-tunes was 3 times the price.

Amazon review: It's a good cd to download at a low price.  It's soo hard to sing along with.  Would rather have the song download and listen on my ipod.  I downloaded the song to my ipod because I was thinking about getting a mp3 player which has a CD player.  I did not know how to play mp3 on my ipod.  I downloaded the song from amazon, but not sure if it plays on my ipod or not.  I don't have the ipod to try it out.  Would love to try it out on my ipod.

Amazon review: This song is just what I've been looking for in my life.  I was introduced to it by my pastor, and I've sung it and hummed it on my heart.  If you don't like the new songs, I would say do not download this cd.  It's a big hit with the ladies.  I've had many ladies who have come out and sung it for the church and it has made the women who listen to it feel better.  I've had plenty of men who have come in and asked me to sing a song like this.  They are so glad they found out about it.  I don't think the original song is very good for church, but the new songs have a lot of good spirituals that are great.  This song is one of the songs that is so amazing that it really helps a person to take a step towards God.  I pray that this will help many people to find their way to God.  I've had so much fun when I've sung this song to the ladies and men.  It's so good to be around people that are so positive and happy.  I think I'm going to download it to my ipod and send it to people all around the world.

Amazon review: I downloaded this song and was so impressed by it.  It was like a light went on in my heart, and I knew I had to share it with others.  This is a great song to download.

I was so glad when it came out.

Amazon review: I downloaded the CD and I loved it.  I haven't figured out why it didn't work for me - just didn't seem to be something I would enjoy.  I downloaded it for a friend and she loved it.  I downloaded it for a group of ladies who wanted it for a contest.  They loved it.  I downloaded it for a family member, and they loved it.  It was a great cd just like the woman said.  I think I'll download it for when I'm going on a trip.  I can even play it on my ipod.  I hope my friend loves it.  All they want to do is sing the CD.  They just don't want to hear the song on itunes.  I downloaded the song to my ipod.  I downloaded it to my ipod for when I go to the beach and I can't download it on my ipod because I have an ipod touch.  I hope it doesn't get messed up.  I downloaded the song for my friends and they love the songs, but like I said the songs didn't sound like something I would listen to.

Amazon review: This song isn't bad, but I thought it didn't sound like much of a song to sing with, but I guess it is a good song to sing with.  If you want to sing with a positive attitude, then download this song.  I would have liked to have it on my ipod.  I downloaded it to my ipod for people to listen to while I'm out and about.  It's good for people to play it on their ipods while they are out and about.  I downloaded the song for my children, and they love the song.  Now, I have to download it to my ipod to give to my grandchildren.  I hope the song doesn't get messed up by my children.  I hope it doesn't get messed up by someone.

Amazon review: Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.  Perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music, or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music, or I suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background.

The songs are well arranged and each song is well delivered.  The only real problem I see is the poor sound quality.  The only other issue I can see is that the songs are short.

Amazon review: Have you ever felt like your day was dragging? Those days when you're upset for no reason at all? How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.  I have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above afflictions is listen to "Eye Of The Tiger". This song will cure any mental ailment.

Amazon review: I was surprised to hear that this song was released by another artist, but JMC's rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to Christian Kane's power ballad.  I would highly recommend folks go over to Christian's page here on Amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album "House Rules".

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this song, probably because I've heard other artists do it more than once, and I've actually never seen this artist perform live, but I guess, for some reason, I just don't like this song.  It's a good song, it's just a little too 'bout it for me.  I like the "Honey, Honey" and "Gimme" lines, but the rest of the song is just too much.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would say that this was one of the most underrated song on JMC's discography, and this is probably the reason why I don't like it as much as the songs other artists have done, but still, it's not that bad, and it's definitely one of his most underrated songs.  It's a great song that's just not up to par with what I expect from a JMC song, and yet, when I put it on, it seems to be a lot better.  It's a very enjoyable song to listen to.

The song is catchy, and the lyrics are very catchy, but I just don't like it as much as the other songs that he's done so far.

I hope we'll get the whole album.

Amazon review: Okay, I know I know, but I love this song.  It's easy to listen to, it's fun to listen to, the lyrics are catchy, and the music is great.  It has a great beat to it, you can't help but sing along, and the chorus always makes me smile.  Even if you're not into JMC's music, I guess you should still check out this song because it's really good.  This song would be great if it was on the radio, but I guess it's not.  It's just a little off for me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is pretty good.  The lyrics are good, and the music is really good.  The beat is cool, and the lyrics are fun.  I'd say this song is pretty good for a JMC song.

Amazon review: I like this song, but it's a little off for me (or maybe it's just me).  As the lyrics say, "Loud as hell, but soft as a baby's butt", so I guess it's fine for me, but I don't like that it's so loud, and it's just a little too similar to "All I Want Is You".  I would say this song is better than "All I Want Is You", and it's a hit song for the artist.  I only wish it was a little bit more different than the rest of his discography, because the rest of his discography is really good.  I'd recommend this song for the people who are into the artist, and for the people who like the artist.

Amazon review: Where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyrics go? While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").

Amazon review: The best CD I've heard in a long time.  The only song that isn't 100% country that I don't like is "Dracula's Daughter" and that might be because I don't like all the "funny" songs that are in it.  But overall, the songs are great, the voice of the artist is wonderful and the music is fantastic.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times and I still have not heard the songs I liked.  I don't think they are that bad, but I just could not get into the songs.  I guess the songs that really stand out are "Carry Me Back" and "I'm A Loser," but the rest of the songs are ok.  However, the songs are not bad.  I guess the ones that I cannot stand are "Dracula's Daughter" and "Ain't It Enough."  That's all I can say.  There are a few good songs on this album, but they are not all that good.  I haven't listened to this album in a long time and I wish I could buy it again.  I probably would put it in my collection, but it's not a must-own CD.

Amazon review: I like this album.  It's a good mix of the original version of Merle Haggard's song and the original version of Bob Dylan's song.  I'm a big fan of both artists, so I think that it's a good album for anyone that loves music.

He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Amazon review: I really expected to be blown away by this album.  It was one of the best selling records the year it came out, and this record cemented Lil' Wayne as one of the biggest rappers on the planet.  You couldn't turn the TV on without seeing him or this record.  However, There were only 3 or so songs that I liked.  The other songs just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me.  This review is not a reflection on Weezy's rap style or lyrics, but maybe the producing.

What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: I think I may be the only person on this forum who's actually listened to this song prior to writing this review.  If you have, it's the first time you've heard this song, and have no idea what the hell you're singing.  But I'm writing this review because I'm not an idiot.  And I'm writing it because I'm a realist.  I know that Sinatra was only one of dozens of singers who had a voice that could sound like this.  And that he was able to get the most out of it.  I'm not going to be so arrogant as to claim that no other singer or actor ever sounded like this.  And I'm not going to be so arrogant as to claim anyone else ever sounded like this.  This is just the way I heard this song.  And I heard this song the first time I heard it, I don't remember.  I just remember it and I remember it as being so different from the way it sounds on this CD.  But, then I remember hearing this song on this CD and thinking, "I've heard this song before.  I've heard this song in a million different shapes and forms.  I've heard this song hundreds of times.  I've heard this song hundreds of times."  And I was impressed.  But, it was the only copy of the song that I had available, and I just didn't have the courage to listen to it.  But, I am now, and am writing this review to say, "Hey, it's not my place to decide whether or not I like a song, or who's a good singer or a bad singer.  You can't please everyone."  But, you know, someone has to make a decision and I'm sorry that I was one of the many critics who didn't care enough to give this a fair hearing.  I just wanted to say that, from my perspective, it's not the first time I've heard this song.  It's not the first time that I've heard a song I've heard before.  I've heard this song hundreds of times in a million different forms.  I've heard this song hundreds of times in a million different songs.  And, I'm going to listen to this one more time.  And, then I'm going to listen to it again.  And, maybe I'll write a review in the future.  But, first of all, I'm not going to write a review about this song.  I'm not going to write a review about any of the songs on this CD.  I'm not going to tell you about the songs.  I'm not going to tell you about the artist.  I'm going to tell you about the song and I'll tell you why I think it's so good.  And then I'll tell you why I don't like it.  I'll tell you if I liked it or not.  And, if I didn't like it, you'll know why.  And, if I liked it, you'll know why.  And, if I didn't like it, you'll know what I didn't like.  And, if I liked it, you'll know what I liked.  And, if I didn't like it, you'll know I'm not telling you what I liked.

Amazon review: In the first place, I would like to comment that this song has been covered so many times and yet, I've never heard this one or any of the versions like this before.

I'm going to sing it like a Sinatra, and I'm going to sing it in a way that he would have sung it if he were alive today and not only singing it the way he did, but singing it like Sinatra would have sung it.  I'm going to sing it like Sinatra did when he was alive.  I'm going to sing it like Sinatra would have sung it if he were alive.

This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?

Amazon review: have always loved this song- more the music than the words. It seems to be the only one by Gotye that I like though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: I enjoyed it more when I was a 16 year old hippie. Audio quality was good. I forgot the rant about God though and that was enough for me to delete it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of Gotye's music since he was a child and this is the first time I have heard him sing live, but I am still amazed at the sheer genius of his performance.  I was a bit surprised that none of Gotye's songs can top this one in quality.  I think he is very underrated. This song is my most favorite one.  I was a bit worried that the song was going to be a typical Gotye fare but it turned out to be very good.  The only thing that I had to complain about was the ending. I don't think it was supposed to be a joke after all.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good song that I would have enjoyed more when I was a kid.  I don't think anyone will be able to tell that the song is not a Gotye original.  I am not sure whether the recording quality in this song is as good as the one in "Oh My My My" or "The Book of Love" but it was not at all bad.   I think this is a good song to get you started singing along to the chorus so it will give you that little boost.  The song is very simple and I will admit it is very repetitive but it is very simple and that is what makes this song so great.

When it arrived, we immediately slid it into the CD player and were very surprised and disappointed. Although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept releases by TSO, this concept left us very cool. There is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise. We are pretty sophisticated listeners with extremely diverse musical tastes, but I must say this one was a bust.

Amazon review: Very disappointing. I've been eagerly awaiting this album for months now. I had a great time listening to it as a complete collection. Now it sounds like it was made for a dance floor. The vocals have a very weak quality when singing in 3/4 time which makes it hard to understand. There are times when it sounds like it was recorded in a cheap home studio. There is no instrumentation on the CD, just vocals over a drum machine. The CD is very average. If you are into electronic music, this CD will appeal to you. If you're not, you might as well skip it.

Amazon review: I really like this album. I'd rather have this album on my iPod than over the air radio. This album is perfect for listening to while walking, sitting, lying on the couch or doing anything else. The songs are all very catchy, and very easy to sing along with. The only thing I don't like about this album is that the album is all about a single girl that goes to a party to meet her boyfriend. The songs aren't about her boyfriend, but they are about her and how the party is going and how she is feeling. The songs are very long and very boring.

They really love the song and they dance to it.  I hope they do.  I would like to know how people who do not dance get the dance moves.  I had thought the song was short, but not long.  It is definitely not a 2 1/2 minute song.  It is a 3 minute song.  I have listened to it several times without making it to the end.  I am sure the people who do not dance have it memorized by now.  I would love the song to be longer, but I guess that is not the music it is trying to be.  I have listened to the song maybe 5 times in the last 3 days.  It is good.  I hate to tell you this, but I don't think the song can be made better.  I am looking for another song to listen to.  Thank you, Belinda for recording this song.

This is one of my favorite Belinda songs.  I loved this track when I first heard it, and I love this version even more.  It is not as long or as repetitive as other tracks on the album, but it is still just as memorable.  I am sure I will listen to this song again in the future.  I am also sure I will listen to the rest of the album.  That is the beauty of the Belinda's album.  There are some good songs, but then there are some great songs.  This is not a bad song, but it is not one of the best songs.  It is a good song for a casual listener, but not for an avid Belinda listener.  I can tell you that I will listen to it again, but it won't be on the first play-through of the Belinda album.  I am looking forward to the rest of the album and hope it will be worth the wait.

Amazon review: There is one song that can be heard on the radio while driving by.  That song is "You Are My Sunshine".  The lyrics to that song is not too bad, but the music is not the best.  It is the vocals that make the song.  You know who sang it?  It was Belinda herself!  She did a beautiful falsetto.  She sounded like a young Mary Tyler Moore.  I loved hearing that song and I love that it is on the album.  I am impressed with her vocal talent and am looking forward to the rest of the album.  Thank you Belindacape for recording this song.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album on several more times since I bought it.  I always end up listening to it again in the car, where I just have to listen to it.  I didn't realize that this was a country album, but I was listening to it while driving, so that is why I have this on CD.  The songs are decent, but the vocalists are pretty bland.  I had no idea that country music actually has some good songs, but I thought that it was just country songs.  They aren't country songs with country singers, but I guess that most of them are.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great country album.  I think that it is a better album than I thought it would be.  A lot of the songs have a country vibe to them, but that is what country is all about.  I like the vocals on a lot of these songs, especially the first 3 CD's.  This CD is a little too country for me though, the songs are just not that memorable, so I probably won't buy this again.  The album is ok, but it could have been a lot better.

Amazon review: This is the first album by the band The Vandals.  I just bought this album b/c I needed something to listen to before bedtime, I heard that it was great and it sounded good, and I was looking for something that I could listen to while I was driving.  I have listened to this album over and over again since I got it, and I always end up listening to it again.  I don't think that I would have bought this album if I didn't have to listen to it while driving, so that is why I am having this on CD.  It is kind of a country album, and it is a country/rock album at the same time.  The lyrics are kind of dull, but the songs are really catchy, and the vocals are pretty good, so it is a good country/rock song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is their second album.  I have this CD on CD now.  I have played this CD a total of 5 times, because I just keep listening to it.  The songs are ok, but nothing really grabs me.  I have always liked the music from this band, and this CD is a little bit like the country/rock album that I have been listening to.  The vocals are ok, but I think that this CD has a little bit of a country vibe, but not as much as the first album did.  I also like the songs on this CD a little more than the last one did.  I think that the band is just getting better, and this next CD will be great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've really enjoyed this cd.  It's really different from what I'm used to, so I am really enjoying it.  It has a little bit of a different style than what I'm used to though.  The lyrics are a little boring, but the songs are really good, so I really think that this CD is a must have for any country fan.  I think that it is just a little bit country, and a little bit rock, but it is definitely a must have for any country fan.

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

Amazon review: This is one of the best rock songs of all time.  I was in the car with my parents in the summer of 1991 and we stopped at a gas station to listen to some radio station.  The station had a song by the Foo Fighters.  The song was called "My Hero".  It was so good that I downloaded it and brought it with me to the gas station.  The next day when I went back to the gas station I asked the guy that was working there to play me the song.  He played it and I was so amazed that I actually drove home and listened to the entire song over and over again.  I remember this song from when I was 14 years old.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the band and I love their music.  I was always a huge fan when I was younger.  Now with the way that they have been treated I can't be a fan anymore. The band has been treated like crap and they are selling out shows and touring while their fans have to buy their own tickets or go to the shows for free to see them.  The fact that they are selling out shows and touring while their fans are having to buy their own tickets or buy the tickets for the shows is just wrong.  They are using their own fans as props and it's really disempowering.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is one of my all time favorites.  If they never put their music out or didn't have this song on an album, they would still be a big band without having to tour and sell out shows.  I don't know what they are doing.  As an older fan I don't like to see bands that are putting out the same old stuff over and over again. I only like to see new music.  I love this song, but I don't want to hear this song.

An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders.

Amazon review: She did a Song in English so you guys can also understand the meaningless things she has to say. And this song is the most meaningless she ever did. But her voice sounds much stronger. This is not a typical Blmchen-song. There are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics. there are three Songs on this Single. The radio Version, the Extended version and the Song "Where hearts have wings".It's the english version of her Song "Herzen haben Flgel". I think it's on the Blossom-Album "Heartbeat"

Amazon review: Frank Sinatra did not have it easy in the beginning of his career. His first few recordings were poorly made and sounded very bad. Then he met Dean Martin and all of a sudden he was a superstar. Sinatra was no longer "that kid from Texas" and he was now able to have his music appreciated on par with some of the "classics" from the Great Generation. There is a lot of great music out there ( not in the genre of classical music) but many people are not aware that many great artists, such as Frank Sinatra, were able to make a career out of their music because of the many different people who worked with him on his recordings. This CD is a fine example of Sinatra's amazing ability to write and arrange music.

Amazon review: This is the most boring and unlistenable CD I have ever played.

The music is so boring and uninteresting that it's unlistenable.

Amazon review: This is the best band I have ever been able to listen to.  They are on the top of my favorite band list.  I was lucky enough to get my hands on the first two albums and I still listen to them today.  They are my favorite band and I am so happy I discovered them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to this band for a LONG time.  I would have to say the band that influenced me the most.  They have a unique sound that has a lot of heart and soul.  They are a band that you can truly feel the music through.  Their music is definitely not mainstream and has a lot of heart and soul.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this band and all their music.  Their music is so full of emotion and has a lot of heart and soul.  I wish I could be in the band.  The band has such a unique sound that has a lot of heart and soul.
Sentiment: Positive

This is the album I remember my Mom playing when I was a young kid.  It was the band that I loved to listen to when I was little- I was in 3rd grade and my Mom bought me this album.  I started getting into the band when I was like 12.  My dad was trying to get me to play guitar but I told him that it was not a good idea because it took forever to learn chords.  He gave up on that idea and I was more interested in listening to rock music.  I am glad I listened to this album.
Sentiment: Positive

I was introduced to the band in the sixth grade and they were the band that I loved the most.  I was 16 at the time.  I remember this band was the band that I wanted to be in.
Sentiment: Positive

This album, not only did it change my life, it also changed my opinion of music.  I always thought that music was a nice thing to listen to but I never really understood why people were into it.  I just wanted to listen to music, not play it.  I think it was when I got into this band that I realized music was something that could actually be a great thing to listen to.  Not only did it change the way I look at music, it changed my life.  It made me feel a lot more connected to the world around me.  I remember thinking, how cool is that?  How cool is that for all of you to be listening to the same thing that I am listening to at the same time.  It really made me realize that you could make music that connects you to someone else and it could make you feel something.  This album made me feel something because I realized that the music I had been making was actually something that people connect with.
Sentiment: Positive

This band is on a different level from the rock bands that I grew up with.  They have a unique sound.  They have a lot of heart and soul.  They have a lot of emotion in the songs.  They are a band that I always wanted to be in.  I remember thinking that I wanted to be in a band and that this band was going to be the one.  I remember getting into this band and listening to this album for the first time.  It was a pretty big deal because I had been listening to rock music for so long and I didn't really know what to do with my life.  I remember thinking that this band was going

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of country music and was excited to find this collection of country songs. While it's missing the greats like Conway Twitty and Dolly Parton, there are a few good songs here. I could definitely use some more new country artists to watch or listen to. The vocals on this album are very good, and the songs are well produced.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album. It is just a wonderful album. The vocals are very good, and the songs are so well written. It is a great album. I do wish the songs had been longer. There are a few songs that could have been longer, such as "I'll Hold You in My Heart" and "I'll Fly Away".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have read over 50 reviews, and the reviews are all positive except for the lack of female singers. It is just not a strong genre. A few of the songs I liked, and a few that I did not. I do like the album and will purchase it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a little disappointed in this album. I expected something new and different, but I guess I am used to the same old songs and the same old singers. The album starts off with "I Believe in You" which is a wonderful song, but it seems to drag on. The songs "The More I Know You" and "How Can I Be the One to Say Goodbye" are very good, but have a very weak last minute hook.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I got this album as a freebie and I love it! It is a great collection of songs. The vocals are great, the production is great, the songs are great, and the lyrics are great! There is a little bit of country, a little bit of rock, a little bit of country-pop, a little bit of dance, a little bit of ballads, and a little bit of rock. These songs have a great energy and a great feel.

Amazon review: I love this album. I have had the CD for a few weeks and am in love with it. I feel as if I am listening to my favorite country singer. The songs are well written and the vocals are great. It really doesn't matter what genre of music you listen to, but I think it's great that this album has such a variety of genres. I love how this album is all about love and not about what's in your heart. I think this is a wonderful album to listen to on a nice day when the weather is nice and the sun is shining. When I listen to this album, I usually do not want to get up from the chair. I usually do not want to pick up my guitar to play along with the songs. I usually do not want to go outside to play in the yard with my friends. I just want to listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am very happy with this album. There are a few songs here that are good, but not great. "I Got a Right" is very good, but the "Loser" is one of the worst songs on the album. "I'll Fly Away" is a good song, but as a whole, this album is average. I hope it becomes a hit like "My Guy" did.

Amazon review: this album is ok, but not great. There is a song here that I like, "My Guy" and a song there that I like, "Just Got Paid", but the rest is pretty bad. "I'll Fly Away" is a good song, but the rest of the songs are ok. I am not a big country fan but this album does not disappoint.

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first album of the "Beat It" series was an instant classic, and as a follow-up album, Thriller is even more of a classic.  This is one of the best albums of the '70s, and it's even better when you realize that it was recorded in 1969.  Thriller is easily the best album of the '70s that isn't just a copy (or a copycat).
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've never heard anything like this, and I don't know how it was done but this is great.  The only thing is that I'm not sure about the lyrics.  I'm not sure if it's just me or if it's the other people too.  The only part that I can listen to is the song, "Beat It"  because "Beat It" is my song.  I love that song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have no regrets about purchasing this album.  It was an instant classic even though I was a teenager when it was recorded.  Thriller is the best album of the 1970s, and the best album of the decade.  It has everything that makes a great album.  It has great musicianship, great vocal talent, great arrangements, great production.

###
Amazon review: I don't think I've ever been so surprised as when I first heard this album.  Thriller is a great album in my opinion.  Michael Jackson has always had a great voice, but it was never until this album that he was able to pull off an album like this.  I'm a Michael Jackson fan, so I was very familiar with the albums that Michael was involved with.  Thriller is an album that I'm very familiar with.  I've listened to it a lot over the last few years.  It's a great album that is worth every penny.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Thriller is great!  I own it on vinyl and I own the CD.  It's an amazing album.  It's easy to get lost in the words, but when you come back and listen to the song, "Beat It", you'll always remember why you bought it.

And that's saying something.

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I enjoy the songs from this album, but they are almost all too depressing. "The Last Goodbye" is just a very sad song.  "The Good Man" is just too sad.  "The Last Goodbye" is just a very sad song.  "Lover's Leap" is just a very sad song.  "The Good Man" and "Don't Forget Me" are just sad songs.  "Lover's Leap" is just a very sad song in comparison to the rest.

Amazon review: I was born in Sacramento, CA.  I grew up listening to all the different local bands.  I never really understood what it was all about because I was so busy with school and sports.  I wanted to be a musician and have been a band leader for a couple of years.  I saw the Foo Fighters at a show in Sacramento.  I was so excited because my wife and I watched them play at a local theater.  I wanted to get signed by them.  I was going to send the manager a picture of myself that I had dressed up in the Foo Fighters shirts.  The manager told me that he would look at the picture and tell if it was good enough to sign me.  I went home that night and talked to my wife about the manager.  I told her that I was going to go to the manager and tell him directly that I was going to sign with the Foo Fighters because I do not want to sign with anybody else.  My wife told me not to go to the manager and tell him that I was going to sign with the Foo Fighters.  She told me that I should just ask the manager for an autograph.  I asked the manager and he told me that I could not sign with the Foo Fighters because I was too young to be a band leader.  I told him that I was

Amazon review: Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.
