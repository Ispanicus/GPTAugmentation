Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  My wife and I are both from the same small town in Oklahoma and she is the best "home-grown cowgirl."  But I don't think I am.  I just like the way I look and act.

I'm looking for a song to listen to that I enjoy.    This is not a song I will listen to often.  I will listen to it once in a while though.

I listened to this album again and again  and still like the band.    I don't have any problems with the CD.    I had to listen to it a few times to get used to the sound of it.    I hope the band is still together and not dissappointing the people who enjoy their music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I thought I was going to enjoy this CD, but my whole experience was a complete and utter disappointment. The whole CD is full of filler and it's just very hard for me to get into.  The music is fine, but the singing itself is horrible. The words are so bad I can't even repeat them. I couldn't believe how bad they were and how poor the singing was. I'm not sure how a good singer would sing this.  I can't remember the last time I saw a CD that was this bad for me.  The only reason I would give this a 5 is because of the cover art. I think this is a great cover for an obscure song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is another great song I know I've heard before, but since I've started to really listen to this song I have to say it's a great song.  The best song I have on my playlist, and I can't stop listening to it.  I listen to it when I'm on the bus, in class when I have something to do, and when I'm on the way to work.  It really does the trick, it's a great song and I can't stop listening to it.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of Eric Clapton and a bit of a Clapton fan.  I liked his playing and just liked his style.  I could always identify his style because of the way he played.  I did my best to emulate his style, and I never really succeeded.  I would just end up trying to play faster, or play the same chords over and over.  I would just feel out the song and try to replicate what he was doing.  So, I never became a Clapton fan.

The song 'One Armed Man' is the song that made me fall in love with this album.  I do not understand why they kept this song off the album.  I love the lyrics and the guitar playing is great.  Thank you for putting out an album, and I hope the rest of the CD is as good as this one.

Amazon review: I love this cd, I love the songs.  I want more of these songs.  I am very happy with this cd.  I will buy it again.  I want more of this cd.  There is an awesome song called "We Are the People" by the band The R. Kelly.  I love it.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of rap lately; it's so great.  I can't listen to the music I'm used to for very long before I go crazy.  I'm starting to like rap and R. Kelly's music.  The song "We are the people" is a great song.  I love that song.  Thanks R. Kelly for sharing it with your fans.

Amazon review: I got this cd from the library.  It's great, but I have a problem.  I have to have this cd.  I bought it at a library in Atlanta, GA.  I need to get it.  It's a great cd, but I just don't understand how you can put out so many songs without getting to the end.  I love all the songs, but I still can't get to the end.  Please, please make another CD.  I want more songs.

Amazon review: I'm a little nervous.  I've never even heard of R. Kelly before.  I've heard a few things about him, and I really like a lot of what I've heard.  What's cool is that he sings very good, and he doesn't talk much.  I wish I could sing, but I'm not.  I just like listening to him sing.  I love the song "I love you" and the song "Dance With Me".  Thanks for sharing your music with us.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon.com review summary for Four Seasons (Four Seasons)

By: jasmine

Comment:

I love this CD. I bought it two weeks ago and have just started listening to it. I'm really enjoying it. The songs are really good, but I also like that there are a couple of songs where the words are sung and not just spoken. I like to listen to the CD in the car too. The songs are very relaxing and I even like the way Four Seasons played them. I'd recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: One of the first new adult albums I've been able to obtain in decades and i must say i'm glad I did.  Not just because it's good but because I'm glad I was able to obtain it in the first place.  I've been waiting for this album to come out for a very long time.  I'm not saying a lot on this matter, i just have to say it, it's good.  And it's a very good album.  I would put The New American Dream on the very short list of my top ten favorite albums of all time.  (I'm not saying that they are my favorites just that they are my top ten favorite albums.)

Amazon review: Have heard this song before but hadn't listened to it in awhile.  I downloaded this cd so i could hear the song for the first time since i first heard it.

I highly recommend this cd and i hope it gets a big reaction when it comes out.

Amazon review:  It's a pretty good cd.  I have had the CD for two weeks now and I am still learning to like it.  It's not my top ten favorite albums, but it's not bad.

Amazon review: I had read a review of this album and decided to check it out.  I was surprised to find that the songs were not as good as I had heard on the cover.  It was a bit overpriced for what I would expect, but I still don't regret listening to it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the songs that were on the cd.  They are a little slow and not as melodic as I expected.  I would like to have heard more live music from the artist, but this was just as good as I would have hoped.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I have to admit I was very disappointed in this album.  I had looked forward to them and had even bought the cd on my own but didn't think they could be much better.

It's not on my top ten list but I would have to say it's not bad.

Amazon review:  I am not a fan of this music but I did not have much time to listen to a lot of music this year.  This is one of the best albums I have listened to because of the arrangements.  I have heard most of the artist's records before and this is the one that I have liked the best.  I would like to have heard more of the artist's live music.  The cd is very well put together.  It has great arrangements and some nice melodies.  Overall, I am very happy with this cd.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album's overall effect is to be a mixture of "Mozart," "Brahms" and "Mendelssohn" without the "mixed" part. While that may be a bit much, the songs are all great, and the musicianship is top notch. The lyrics are just plain and simple, and I like the fact that this opera has been released as a studio album. It's definitely worth checking out.

Amazon review: The only problem with this is that they do not have a track list. The box states that this is a complete recording of The Meters. But, as I recall, they only released the first two albums of their first CD. What are they going to do next? Put out the entire catalog? How long does that take?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing that I noticed about this album was that it was not an all-star collection of music; it's not as deep or original as the two previous albums. However, it is an excellent collection of songs, and the artists involved are all outstanding. As a bonus, many of the songs are great cover versions.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only real drawback to this album is that it has no official lyrics. The album may not be as good as the previous two albums, but "The Meters" is well worth a listen.

Amazon review: The Meters have been one of my favorite bands since their debut CD, and if you like rock and roll of the 70's, then you will love these guys.

Amazon review: This is an eclectic mix of jazz, folk and rock, and it is well presented in its original form. Each of the tracks has a unique feel.

The songs range from the blues to the acoustic folk style to the rock and roll ballads. The lyrics are easy to understand and the musicianship is top notch. This is a very enjoyable album.

The Meters were one of my favorite bands growing up. I was a huge fan of their debut album, and I was surprised when I saw that their second album was coming out. While it disappointed me a bit, the new record is worth checking out.

The album consists of original songs of varying styles: rock, folk and blues. The music is varied and interesting. The lyrics are all extremely well-written and the musicianship is top notch. This is a great album and it is worth checking out.

I thought this album was great. The songs are different, yet all great. Lin Manuel Miranda did a great job of arranging the songs and the music is great

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.
