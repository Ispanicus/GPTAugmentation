Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I thought this record was going to be a lot of fun.  I was wrong.  It's not so much that it is bad.  It just doesn't sound like much of anything.  I mean, I guess it has a little bit of the funk thing going but it's too lame for that.  At least it has some of the other stuff.  Still, it doesn't sound worth much.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: From the opening to the closing choruses, this sounds like three people with a lot of time on their hands having a blast making music.  It's obvious that this band had a lot of fun making this, but it doesn't sound like much fun.

Amazon review:  This is definitely not a great album, but it's not bad either. The songs are decent and the vocals are decent.  The only thing that really detracts from this album is the over-the-top rapping.  The song "Lonely" sounds like a parody of several other songs from the "I'm a Goner" era, but "I'm a Goner" was the first song on CD that I remember hearing.  I have no idea why this band put out "I'm a Goner" as the first song on their debut.  It's still one of the better songs on the album, though, and it's definitely not as bad as some of the other songs on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There is not much to write about this album. There is nothing that makes me think that this band is trying hard.  The songs are alright and the vocals are okay.  The only thing that really made this album worth buying was the CD.  The song "The Dope" is an excellent song.  It is a bit over-produced but still good with good lyrics.  The vocals are okay but I can't really understand them.  On the other hand, the song "I'm a Goner" is a pretty good song but not really a big deal.  It is a song that is just a parody of "I'm a Goner," but it is a pretty good parody.  Also, the band has some decent music and at least they tried to make some good music.  I have no idea why they put out a CD that sounds like this and nothing else.  I would have bought the CD if I had known about it, but it's really not worth it.  The band is just not very good.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: This is the band's first album.  The band has done a lot of mediocre and bad music in the past.  I don't really know why they released this album.  On the other hand, it is a different band and I can't help but like this album.  The album is mainly a parody of other songs from the "I'm a Goner" era.  It is a very good song.  The vocals are okay but the band isn't very good and they haven't tried to do anything with the music.  This would be an album that I would buy if I was a fan of the band.  However, I am not.

Amazon review:  This album is really good.  I bought this CD on sale for $5.  I don't think the band will ever make a good album because they are just not good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have to say that I am not a fan of the song "Love Is In Your Eyes" by John Legend.  I think I do have a problem with his voice...if you are familiar with his voice, then you know what I mean.  I cannot stand it but I have to admit, I really like the song.  I have always liked his voice.  I wish he would have gone more on this side of the border.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you consider the song "Love Is In Your Eyes" by John Legend to sound like it is written by John Legend, then you would have to be a complete idiot.  This song is terrible and you should not even consider purchasing this CD.  The way the lyrics are written, you will NEVER get the idea of what it is saying.  In fact, if you even listened to the song, you should be physically sick that this song is on this list.  There is no way that anyone who would listen to this song ever would have a good time with it.  This song is terrible and you should not even consider purchasing this album.

Amazon review: This is not a very good song, but you have to admit that the words sung by Chris Brown are very catchy.  It seems that I can't get enough of the words sung by Chris Brown on this CD.

Amazon review:  If you're a music lover, then the song "If I Were A Boy" by George Michael should be at the top of your list.  When I first heard this song, I thought it was a very cool song.  I found it very easy to be moved by the song.  I really enjoyed the song and so I bought the CD.  It took me a few listens to get used to the lyrics, but as soon as I did, I felt like I was crying, which is good because I wanted to cry.  I don't understand the lyrics, but I think that the music is good.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed listening to this album.  I think that they have really come into their own as a band and Thalia is one of the most exciting and exciting acts in Latin Pop today.  I really like the way that Thalia has incorporated new pop and new R&B styles into their music.  I really like that they have incorporated new pop and new R&B styles into their music. There are so many different styles all over this album. I really like that they have incorporated new pop and new R&B into their music. There are so many different styles all over

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album from a young artist.  I was disappointed, however, when I heard the first song. It's a sad song, and I guess I didn't like how it was sung.

Amazon review: I listened to a couple of songs on this CD a couple of days ago.  I liked one song but not the rest.  I like some of her other songs and will probably buy the CD.  But I don't like the first song. It's a sad song.  I don't know the name.  I just like the way she sings.    I also noticed that she is not doing a very good job at her singing.  I don't know if I would have the nerve to play such a sad song on the radio.

Amazon review: I liked the first few songs on this CD.  I think some of her other songs are better, but I didn't really care for this album.  I thought the first song was nice, but I just don't understand how it sounds like a cover of anything.  I just don't like it.    I liked the second song.  I think that's only because I was listening to it as an older listener.  I also liked the third song.  I liked the fourth and fifth.  I thought the sixth song was a total ballad.  I don't know if I could do that at my age.

I feel like I could stand this song the whole time, and I would really like to sing this song, but it's too long.  I think the singer is really good, the singing voice is really good, and the song is really good.

Amazon review: I can't stand this song.  It's just too generic, and i'm not a fan of "rock n roll" music.  i'm a country music type of girl.  "we'll take all the rock n roll you have in your life, like the way we take all your white trash/straight edge music"                (this is not a joke, the last thing i want to hear is someone singing about how awesome they are, then they go and do something like this).               That song is boring as hell.               I give "Rise" 2 stars.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Hall and Oates music, but I do like "Rise". For the most part, I've been a fan of Hall and Oates songs for years. I really like "Take It Easy," "Rise," and "You Don't Know Me." But I'm not a fan of "Rise." It's too generic. Too predictable, and I don't like the lyrics. I think it's just a song that's so long, it's just too much to take in at once. It's a great song, but it's just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: This song is so boring.  I can't listen to it for more than 10 seconds.  I don't know why I ever bought this album, I don't understand why I would pay $13 for a CD that is so mediocre in quality, and the songs are so generic and uninspired.  I guess I'm just not a fan of generic Hall and Oates music, but I like "Rise." I thought it was just a good song, but I guess I just found it too generic.  I'm not sure I would have bought the album if it was generic.              I thought it was a good song, but the lyrics weren't my cup of tea, and it was too long to listen to on one CD.

Amazon review: This song is so annoying.  I was hoping it would be different, but it's more like a generic Hall and Oates song than anything.

Amazon review: I don't think Hall and Oates is the best band from Boston, but I do think they are one of the best bands, period.  When they started out, they were a very popular band, and their music was unique.  I've been a fan of Hall and Oates for years.  I've never really felt like a Hall and Oates fan until now.   It's just a boring song.  "Rise" is boring.  It's just too generic and boring.              "Rise" is a generic song.  It doesn't sound like they have any imagination or passion for their music.  The song doesn't sound like anything.              Hall and Oates is just so generic.  It's just a generic Hall and Oates song.     I think they should release a CD with three songs.  I don't know if anybody would buy a three song CD, but three songs that are different and new would be nice.              That would be a better CD than this one.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I feel like a lot of people won't like this because of the vocals and repetitive songs.  I'd like a band that would write more songs that have more variety and would be more enjoyable to listen to.  I don't like repetitive songs with repetitive lyrics like this one.  I can't stand it, it's just annoying.  If I had a single word to describe the song, I would say "boring", but that's only superficial because I can't really think of anything else.  I'm not sure what I would change about the song.

I haven't listened to it yet, but I am impressed to have a song that could be played on Christmas as well as any other day. I have played it enough times to get to know the various parts. The melody is pleasant and the lyrics are very apt. I have not heard any music that compares to this one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: The lyrics are good, but it seems like the music is just too much for the lyrics to be read. I was amazed at how the music made the songs come to life..the music just takes command of the words to make them sing. Not a bad thing...but the lyrics can be taken for granted.

Amazon review: I was disappointed with this album. I thought it would be a little more upbeat, but I was wrong. I was expecting a lot more from this album.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD since the "It's Your Thing" album came out and the vocals are still as good as ever. I can't say it's a bad CD, but i'm not going to say it was a great CD. There is a lot of potential in this CD. I think it would have worked better if the songs had been a little longer. The songs are very good and the lyrics are great. I liked the song "A Little Bit of You," it has good lyrics. I also liked the song "Love Is What You Do."

I've never been a fan of this artist, but he is very good at what he does. The lyrics are good, the music is good, and the vocals are very good. I think the album is a good album, but I'd recommend you not to buy it.

I don't think the CD is very good.  I bought it because the singer was good.  I'm sorry he isn't the best singer, but he is just very good and I just wish he would try to sing a little softer. I hope he gets better and becomes more popular.  The CD is good, but I don't know if I'll be buying more CDs from him.

Review:

This is the 3rd album by American singer-songwriter, Lenny Kravitz, following his two classic platinum albums, "Barely Breaking Even" and "I'm Your Man".

In the early days of Lenny Kravitz, his music was dominated by a heavy, bluesy style, and his albums were often described as 'bluesy' and 'rock-soul'. However, as time went by Lenny began to incorporate elements of pop into his style. Lenny's third studio album, Lenny Kravitz, became his most successful studio album to date. His new approach to music was described as'soulful soul' music and reflected in his new style of singing.

Lenny's songwriting improved considerably and he was able to incorporate more of his personal experiences into the lyrics. This was reflected in the album's title, which was taken from a famous line from one of his songs. The album's title track, "Lenny Kravitz", is a great example of this. The song begins with an intense guitar riff and a chorus of simple, but powerful words. It is this chorus of simple, but powerful words that really encapsulates the album. As the song progresses, Lenny's voice is mixed with samples of a choir, a flute and the sounds of rain hitting the roof, all of which add greatly to the overall effect.

Lenny Kravitz was a huge success on the US charts, reaching number two on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart, and also charting on the Billboard Pop Albums chart at number 28.

Lenny Kravitz was a huge success on the UK charts, becoming his first UK number one album and also charting on the UK Albums chart at number four. This was not Lenny's first charting album in the UK, as he had previously charted with "Barely Breaking Even" in 1979.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.
