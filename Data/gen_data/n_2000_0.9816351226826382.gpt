Amazon review: This music reminds me of the early albums of Gary Numan, mostly because of the instrumentation used. I like the science fiction themes and Robby Garner's vocals. Prodigy 7 has become one of my favorites, and I really like Control.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: I cant believe she had the nerve to sing this  song! she doesnt have the  style  to do so! i feel  the same  way  about  her other  remakes!  [.]!  Thalia sure is very pretty but lacks so much in talent., not  the best of  voices and not  the best  dancer., I went to Dead or  Alives concert in San Francisco  nobody in this planet could sing "YOU SPIN ME ROUND "  as Pete Burns does!

Amazon review: I had hopes of nice old style quality Christmas hymns and songs from Guidepost vinyl albums we have.  Not so.  This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.  There were a few pleasant traditional pieces, but you have to wade through a number of dragging songs to get there. If you want to experiment it might be worth the money, but if you are looking for some uplifting Christmas music I would not recommend this.

Amazon review:  He goes all out.  He's got the soul of the guy who wrote "St. Louis Blues" and "A House Is Not A Home".  I hope that's not a bad thing.  I don't think there is a way to top that kind of vocal. The whole band plays together and I feel like they are all in it together rather than isolated artists in a band.  The production is excellent and they play really well.  I think this is an album everyone should own.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I'm a fan of this group.  They have been playing together for over twenty years. It doesn't get much better than this.  They had me at "I Feel Love".  They have recorded other albums but I own this one.  I don't think I'll buy any other album from them because I already own it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  They are a great band.  This is an excellent recording.  If you like jazz, blues, swing, and R&B.  This is a great collection.  I don't know what the rest of the band did or what happened during the night.  I don't know if the band or the sound engineer was in on the recording, but they have a great sound and a great band.  I highly recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I saw this band in Atlanta.  They were playing at the Peachtree Theater.  It was their first time playing there.  I'm glad I came along.  I was impressed.  I was surprised that they played in the same room with the band.  I've heard some other bands that play in the same room.  I was amazed that they were playing a song that they wrote about their tour in the same room with the band.  It's pretty cool.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I bought this cd.  I didn't know what to expect.  It took me about a week to get it.  It had some good songs on it.  They played at a venue in downtown Atlanta.  I really liked the songs on the album.  I bought five of them.  I have no idea who wrote them.

Amazon review:  I have had this song in my head since 1999.  I have always wanted to sing this song.  It is a great song.  The first time I heard it I was in the back of the church when I first heard it.  I looked up at my pastor and whispered in his ear, "I can't believe I'm singing this!".  I got to sing it at my church where I am a minister and I got to sing it at our annual Christmas service.  I sang it at my son's graduation.  I sang it with the choir on a TV show I used to do.  I sang it with the band when I was at a concert in Kansas City.  I sang it with the band at a concert in the Atlanta airport.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really liked this album.  There are songs you don't want to hear, but there are also songs that you just can't get enough of.  There are several songs that are great.  "I Feel Love" has a great message.  I hope this album gets a good review.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is by far the best album I have ever heard.  This is the first album I have ever purchased.  I love it.  The best song on the album is "I Feel Love".  It's awesome.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The disc came shortly after I ordered it, and has been very impressive ever since.  This young British maestro definitely has this score well under his skin.  The Vienna Philharmonic plays splendedly, especially the lovely ending in the final movement.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has a very good flow of sound that it seems to be going through all the right channels. It seems to be a bit more of an electric band than anything else, even if their guitar and voice is certainly very good. The disc starts off a little slow and then picks up quite a bit as the songs progress. The whole disc seemed to be very well recorded and mixed. The song "The End of the World as We Know It" was particularly good.

Amazon review: I purchased this for the band when they were originally going to be a four piece. I was quite disappointed to find out that with the addition of two members the sound of the band was greatly diminished.  The disc is somewhat over an hour long, but it is well worth the hour and a half to just sit back and listen to the band as they do a cover of "All By Myself" from the original version of the Beatles.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the music on this album.  I would say this was a better album than most of Haynes' other albums, though it is still a little more laid back than his other work.  The sound is very good and the band is really good.  It is a bit hard to find a good song on this disc.  I like the song "The End of the World as We Know It" and "The One That Got Away" but to be honest I don't care for any of them.  The one song I absolutely love is the "Pony Express" song, but I don't know if it is a good song or not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album for my daughter to listen to at home.  Not much of a reason to buy it other than that.  This is a good album, but not great.  It has a few good songs, but also has several bad songs.  Some songs are better than others, but they all are forgettable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another album I purchased at a garage sale and it's a good album.  There is no doubt that Haynes is a talented musician, but this is a little too repetitive and boring.  I don't know what it is about this album, but it is just too predictable.  It would take me at least an hour to listen to it so I guess I couldn't really enjoy this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked this album when it came out.  There is one song that I don't like and it's the same song from the last one, but the song is only 2 minutes long.  The rest of the album is the same as the last one.  I bought the album to take to a friend for her birthday and she loved it.  She is a fan of the new Beatles album so the songs on this album were probably a little different from other Beatles albums.  The one song I don't like is the one song with the piano.  The song is very repetitive and boring.  I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While, at 99 cents, the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances, buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the Messiah by the Bach Collegium Japan is butchered rather badly:  it is drastically (and clumsily cut).  We get the soprano's recitative "There were shepherds abiding in the field," but not the marvelous aria that follows.  And "His Yoke is Easy, His Burden is Light,"  along with "He Shall Feed his Flock" is also missing.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: The mix on this song is awful,the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in Nia's voice. She is from the t.v. show" Dance Moms" and should have let Abby Lee Miller produce her song. Abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces. Nia and her mom Holly made a big mistake not using Abby: As this song is awful, even the title is bad what does a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life?

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.

Amazon review: Shania is my favorite female artist of all time, and one of my favorite artists as well. So, I was so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song. But, I was horribly disappointed when I heard this song. I really expected better from her than this! In the past, I would have bought a Shania CD without bothering to preview it first because I knew that it would be really good, if not excellent. When Shania finally releases her next CD, I'll definitely preview it first, and if it's as bad as "Today Is Your Day," I may not even bother buying it.

This song is not worth anything.  I already have a CD of Shania songs which are just as bad.  I'll probably just wait for the next CD to be released, but this one was pretty much the worst one I've ever heard.  This song is also the only one I've heard where she sings about how she loves you and is willing to make sacrifices for you.  Another thing about this song is that she sings that she is a mother and a wife.  I know that's what you would want your wife to be, but is that really true?  I'm just not sure.  I did like the song she did about how she doesn't want you to spend money on her and how she doesn't need it.  She also sings about how she doesn't have money, but she is willing to make sacrifices for you.  I would just like a little more explanation about what Shania is and isn't before I buy any of her CDs, or even a CD of her music.  I don

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most horrible album I have ever bought.  I love the Beach Boys but this is not a good album.  I bought this because the vinyl was at a reasonable price.  I would definitely not buy this again.  I am disappointed and will not buy this product again.  This release is a complete waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am an old and somewhat cynical fan of the Beach Boys.  I am not going to deny that I love the Beach Boys and am not a "hater" of the band.  I love the idea of the band and the concept of the group, but I have no issues with the music.  I love the Beach Boys as an art form and as a group of individuals.  There are some great songs on this collection.  They are not perfect or perfect for all people, but I feel as though they are perfect for the people that like them the most.  There are some great songs here written by a couple of great writers.  I don't always agree with their songs and the band doesn't always agree with the songs they are writing, but I do think they are some of the best music I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think the Beach Boys have done some great things in their history, and I have always loved their music.  I have listened to this album a lot and I am still proud of the fact that I even bought it in the first place.  In fact, I am still proud of the fact that I bought this album.  The first time I heard this album was on the Beach Boys Anthology, which I had with my sister.  She told me to listen to it, and I did.  I am happy that I bought it, and I am still proud of myself for that.

Amazon review: It has taken me a long time to like this album, but I have finally decided that I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: I love this album.  This album had a huge impact on my life.  I am 45 years old and have never had a song on my radio station that I thought was good.  I was one of those guys who bought the first album and was "OK" with it.  I only liked the "Best Of" albums.  Once I heard this album, I realized that we did not have to buy the first album to like this one.

Amazon review: I bought the CD from Amazon after hearing reviews that said they were defective.  I thought the album was just as good as the others.  This is a great album.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love the songs, and I love the sound.  The songs are so good that I have been listening to this album for over 35 years.

Amazon review: I have been an admirer of the Beach Boys since their very first album. I don't know why I didn't become a fan much sooner.  I am not certain if this is one of their best albums.  It has a lot of good songs written by the great songwriters of the group.  The songs are good, but I think the album is not quite as good as the other albums.  I think the best of the album is the song "I Get Around" and the other songs are really good.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Very strange but a waste of money.

Amazon review: This is a very nice, well thought out, well produced, and thought-out album. The production is top-notch and the vocals are great.

I would have much preferred to have the songs available in an MP3 format.

I guess people do not want to hear their favorite band's newest cd until it is out on the street.  This cd is not worth the money I spent on it.  I was not happy with it.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

Amazon review: This is a truly embarrassing mess from a truly terrible band.  When I first got the album, I thought it was ok.  I listened to the two "songs" I wanted to hear.  They were terrible, but I actually thought they sounded like the rest of the album.  As I listened to it, more and more problems started to appear.  The first song was awful, but after I heard the other songs, it became clear that the "band" was a huge joke.  I can't believe these people are still allowed to perform in public.  They should be banned like the Rastafarians.  This is a disgrace to the genre.  So many other bands have tried to take their place, but they fell flat on their faces.  I'll never buy them again.  The worst is, I'm an avid Van Halen fan.  I'm not going to take anything less than 10 stars, so I'll say that I'll never buy this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This guy is so stupid.  He has a song titled "You and the rest of the world are the most important thing in the universe" and he goes and sings "I love it".

Amazon review: This album has nothing to do with Van Halen.  I like the song "I'm a Woman" because it's a nice song.  What makes this album bad is that this band has made a mistake.  They have a lot of material to choose from.  This album should have been a compilation of the best material they put together.  The only problem with this album is that they have not learned from their mistakes.  This album is a huge, massive failure.

Amazon review: I've had this album for years.  I like the songs "You're Not Alone" and "I Can See For Miles" a lot.  They're really good.  In fact, I think "You're Not Alone" is better than "Dream On" and "I Can See For Miles" is better than "Dream On".  I'm trying to decide whether I should buy it or not.  It's really hard to decide because I love some of the songs and hate some of the songs.  I really don't have a good answer for this question.  I think it depends on how much of a fan I am, and if I want to get the CD.  I don't think I could ever hate this album.  I could probably even like it a little bit.  It's hard for me to decide because I like some of the songs and hate some of the songs.  I really can't decide.  I think I'll probably get it.  I always like to get the CD and I don't think I'll change my mind.  I always wonder if I should get the CD or not.  I don't mind purchasing it if I have to, but it's hard for me to decide.  I'd like to get it, but I don't know if I want to.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: While, at 99 cents, the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances, buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the Messiah by the Bach Collegium Japan is butchered rather badly:  it is drastically (and clumsily cut).  We get the soprano's recitative "There were shepherds abiding in the field," but not the marvelous aria that follows.  And "His Yoke is Easy, His Burden is Light,"  along with "He Shall Feed his Flock" is also missing.

Amazon review: This is the best version of a song I've had the pleasure of hearing by an English singer. I have been a fan of David Gilmour's singing, and this is a superb recording of a song he recorded with his band the Pink Fairies. This is a beautiful mix of the old country ballad along with some light rock'n'roll. I am impressed with the song choice, with the inclusion of some great songs like "Lover, Lover" and "Mama" that I haven't heard before. Gilmour's singing is a joy to listen to. I especially like the inclusion of the "Don't Fence Me In" that is a favorite of mine.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great album. The vocals are as rich as they get. The band is tight, the musicianship is on par with a "real" rock band. The music is energetic and the album is as smooth as a freshly poured smoothie. I feel this album will stand out on whatever shelf I put it on.

Amazon review: There is so much depth to this album that it's hard to narrow down what's great and what's not.  It's got a lot of great songs, but I had to go back and listen to every single song to really understand what they were doing.  The highlights are the "In the Garden of Love" and "Love Will Tear Us Apart."  I love the acoustic versions of "The Man That Got Away" and "I'm a Loser."  I love the acoustic version of "The Way I See It" because it's got that perfect balance between country and rock'n'roll.  I love the acoustic version of "I'll Go Crazy" because it's got that same perfect balance.  I love the acoustic version of "A Thousand Miles" because it reminds me of a song I've been listening to with my dad for weeks.  I love the acoustic version of "The Man That Got Away" because it's got that same perfect balance.  I love the songs "The Girl I Knew in Another Town" and "The Man That Got Away" because they're perfect.  I love the acoustic version of "What You Need" and "Somewhere in the Night" because they're perfect.  I love the acoustic versions of "Lover, Lover" and the acoustic version of "Mama" because they're perfect. I love the acoustic versions of "In the Garden of Love" and "Love Will Tear Us apart" because they're perfect.  I love the acoustic version of "Can't Get Enough" because it's got that old country sound.  I love the acoustic version of "I'm a Loser" because it's got that old country sound.  The album is a great collection of great songs that will make you want to listen to it again and again.

Amazon review: My first CD was a gift to my mom, after she bought me "Mama Don't You Do That" off of the CD in my stocking.  As a kid, I wasn't exactly into country music, but I would listen to the radio stations, and would hear a CD with a song by one of my favorite bands, and I'd be drawn to it.  So of course, my mom bought me "Mama Don't You Do That."  It was the only song I ever liked on the radio.  I thought my mom was being so nice, because I was a little kid and she just wanted to give me a "high five," but I found out later that she had given the CDs to me because she thought I would like them.  I am a sucker for "good" songs, and this was one of those that I liked, but I didn't care for it.  I love all kinds of music, but I have to admit that "Mama Don't You Do That" was not one of my favorites.  I still have it and have not given it away, but I will keep it as an example to show people what not to do.  I have three other CDs that I gave away when I realized I didn't like the music.  I would rather give away CDs I don't like, than ones that I do like, but I can't say for sure, because I don't listen to CD's on my stereo.

Amazon review: I'm sure I'm not the only one who had high hopes for this album, but was disappointed.  I was listening to some of this album the other night, and the CD started to sound like crap, and you can tell.  It didn't take much time for the CD to turn a "sick" sound.  I was thinking, "What is wrong with this CD?"  I don't understand how someone can listen to a CD and not be able to hear the difference when the CD is a few seconds long.  I still have it, because I don't want to throw this CD away, and I don't want to give it away.  I will probably send this CD to my good friend who plays the drums in a band, in order that he can learn the songs, so he can give it to one of his friends.  I can't tell you why, but I think that if he has to learn the songs, then he will like them more.  Not that I have anything against learning the songs on the CD, but I can't say that I am any better off because of it.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: The band was named after the late great Tupac Shakur but with a "u" to make it sound like a "s" rather than an "o".  I like the production of this album.  It's quite impressive.  I had a hard time figuring out what to like about it.  I like hearing O.A.R.  That's what I was buying the cd for.  However... I had a hard time figuring out what to like about it.  The production is good, but the song selection is horrible.  From the opening song to the end, there isn't one song that I like, and there are many songs that I hate.  Even the songs that I like have a lot of filler songs and cliched dance music like "Do It Like A Dude" or "Trap Music".  But what is worse is that every song is overproduced.  There are a few good songs on this cd, but they're drowned out by the filler.  I don't know, the song selection was good, but I think the production killed the album.  I'm going to pass.  I don't want to buy an O.A.R. cd, or any cd of this band.  Good bye!!!

Amazon review: I bought this cds because I'm just starting to see the band in a live setting and I wanted to hear them perform.  I'm not sure I like this cd, I think the production is really good, but the song selection is really bad.  I think the band should have released an album that was not so overproduced.  I don't want to purchase this CD because I don't want to hear the same music over and over and over again.  I've heard the band play live several times though and I really like what I've heard.  And the production on this cd is really good.  I think the band should have released an album that had a better song selection and not such an overproduced album.  I hope this review doesn't put me off buying this cd, but I don't think I will.  I'll probably buy this cd and then buy another cd or two because of the good production and I like the songs on this cd.  I'm not going to stop listening to O.A.R. because of one review.

The only good song on this CD is "Rising Sun", but it's a very repetitive song that I would rather listen to on The Cure's "Candy Says".  I don't know if the sound of this CD is done well, but I do know that the song "Café" does have some nice piano parts for a change.  I would recommend some jazz recordings and it would be a great CD if it had a few good songs on it.

The 30 second preview here sounds peaceful (and almost hypnotic to me) but the full version has some strange elements. As the other reviewer said, it does have a lot of static. It sounds like. popping noises, or something to that effect. Very strange.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: In the last few years you have been able to get a lot of great music with different artists like: The Killers, Muse, The Smashing Pumpkins, U2, U2, The Strokes, and of course Jewel. This CD is a nice addition to the mix. The lead single is a nice ballad that would be a nice way to end the album. After that, it is all about the rock stuff on the rest of the CD. I loved the "Run 2 U" album, but I did not love this CD. It's a bit of a letdown after the great album from the past.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is a nice mix of old and new. "I am Nothing" is the first of the two new tracks on this album. The other new track is "It" and it does have a good sound. "I am Nothing" is different from most songs on this album because it is a more subdued song. The lead single is a great rock ballad and it was a nice end to the album. After the rock, it goes into the instrumental "You & I" and it is a nice mix between old and new. It has a nice sound and the vocals sound decent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an interesting album. I find it to be a good mix between old and new. I would say it's a good mix of old and new because a lot of the songs are a mixture of old and new. The album is a great mix of Jewel's new material and old. "I am Nothing" and "It" are great songs. "I am Nothing" is the song of the album. It is one of the best songs you will ever hear on a Jewel album. "I am Nothing" is a simple ballad that would be great on any rock album. "It" is a great song and has a great sound to it. "I am Nothing" is a ballad that is not Jewel's best. It is a different style of Jewel's music and I think it would fit well on most any album. "It" is a great song and it would be a good song to end the album with. After the rock, it is all about the instrumental "You & I" and it is a nice mix between Jewel's new material and old. The lead single "You & I" is a great song and it is a nice change from most songs on the album. The rest of the album is Jewel's best from her last few albums. It is a nice mix of old and new Jewel's music. I would say it's a good mix of old and new because the songs are a mixture of old and new and a lot of the songs are a mixture of old and new. The song "I am Nothing" is Jewel's best song on an album by a wide margin. Jewel's music is great and I am glad that she is continuing to write new material. I do wish that Jewel would have stuck with the music from her last few albums. All of her albums have been good but this one is better than most.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.
