Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This cover is awful.  I have the original to this song.  A lot of guys have this song on their playlist.  If you want to sing along to the song with your friends, please make sure you don't get any ideas from other songs.  This version is very annoying.  There's no reason to sing along to this song.  It's not a very good song anyway.  It's a very bad cover.  But who cares, it's a very fun song, I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.  I don't know why this song is on my playlist.  It's not very good.  I'm not a fan of this song.  I would rather listen to "The Boys" by The Darkness.  I don't even know who it is.  They are not very good.  They are not very good at all.  I hate them.  I hate the guys that sing this song.  They are annoying.  They are not very good.  I don't care about this song at all.  I don't listen to this song.  I don't even know who sings this song.

Amazon review: This song is so good I can't believe they're not singing it.  It's like a mix between "I Believe" and "Take Me Home Tonight" by Journey.  I'm sure it's a joke, but it's so awesome that I think I'm gonna have to buy this and listen to it over and over again.  I can't wait to buy it.  It's so awesome.  I can't believe this isn't being sung.  I think the only way this song can be released is if an actual gay guy sings it.  It's very good.  It's very good.  It's very good.  I can't believe someone would waste their time singing this song.  It's so awesome that I wouldn't mind if they did.  It's better than Journey's version.  I'm sure it's a joke.  I don't know why Journey released this song.  I don't care.  It's so awesome that I want to buy this song.  I don't know how they're not singing this song.  It's very good.  It's very good.

Amazon review: I was really hoping to have heard something at least half decent from this guy after his release of their last album "I am the Devil" and it just falls short.  The vocals are atrocious and he just seems to have a bad attitude on this album.  I wonder what the fuck is going on around here and more importantly, who the fuck is this guy?  I'm not sure if he could name a single one of his songs but he sure as shit can't sing or raps.  I guess that's why he goes by Twiztid..

Amazon review: The first song "The Devil" is very good and the rest are just very poor.  I'd buy the album without this one and I would rather it be on iTunes.  The only song that I'd want to buy is "The Devil" but I am not going to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to give it to Twiztid though.  He's got talent and can sell this album.  I wish he would have released it earlier, and it was at $6 instead of $12 like he did for "I am the devil."  I guess I'll be sticking with the album "Twiztid" and not the album "The Devil."  I've heard it and it's alright.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I really like "The Devil" and "It's a shame."  All the songs except "The Devil" do not really have any redeeming qualities.  "It's a Shame" is decent but "The Devil" is just a waste of time.  I'm only giving it 5 stars because of the song "It's a shame."  I am also giving it five stars for the song "The Devil" because he sounds like he could really go places.  I'll give it a 6 for the other songs on the album and a 7 for the album overall.

Amazon review: It's a shame.  I like the first song "The Devil" and the rest are pretty average.  I guess I'll be sticking with the album "Twiztidd" and not the album "The Devil."  I liked the first song "The Devil" but I'll leave it at that.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: I have a really hard time buying an Eminem CD.  I feel as though the album is a bit of a joke.  I'm not really worried about their musical abilities, as I have heard more competent rappers.  I just can't figure out why they would even release this album.  The lyrics are a joke, the music is a joke, and the band is a joke.  Eminem is no Michael Jackson, but he isn't a joke either.  There are a few songs that are nice, but most of the songs are just plain lame.  If this is where Eminem wants to go, I would rather him go to the movies and make a film there rather than a hipster music album and go to that hipster hipster hipster hipster hipster rap thing.  That's just the way it is.

The song "Rockin' Reggae" is a favorite of mine.  I have listened to this CD many times and each time it is different.  It has some new songs and some old songs that are catchy.  It reminds me of the old times when I was a teenager.  A lot of the songs on this CD remind me of the times when I was in my teens and early twenties.  When I would hang out with my friends and we would listen to old music,  We would always listen to some type of reggae music.  The music on this CD reminds me of the music we listened to in the late seventies and early eighties.  I would like to listen to this CD again and again because it is something different to me and I like the new songs and some of the songs remind me of the songs we listened to in the late seventies and early eighties.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is a nice collection of standards. It is a pleasant collection of songs that remind you of the songs of the 60's. The singers are all good and the production is very good. The two pianos are excellent, along with the two guitars and one string bass. There are two bonus tracks that are not on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this release. It does not have any material that I can easily place in the context of other releases in this series.  The collection of songs on this disc is average. Very few of the songs are good.  I also feel that the artists have to sing in a higher range for a few of the vocal tracks.  I also thought that the songs had a very repetitive sound to them.                I am not sure if it was a mistake of the band or the arranger putting the songs together. It is not a problem that most of the songs are in the 60's, but a problem that they do not fit in with the songs on the other discs in this series.  The songs on this disc are not the best. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to the entire disc. I am happy with the performance of the album.  The two string bass is a very good addition to the album.  The guitarist is very good.  The piano work of the songs is very good. I really like the song, "I'm Waiting" the best. I also like the song, "I Found a Million Dollar Baby" but it does not have any commercial appeal.  The other songs were good.  There were some songs that I liked but do not have any real commercial appeal.  I do not think that I would buy this album.  I think that if I did buy this album the songs would have to be re-recorded to fit in with the other discs in this series.  I have not received any comments from any other reviewers.  I am sorry but I am not impressed with this release.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of this album.  I bought this CD with the hopes of hearing the singer, Jewel, sing.  I was very disappointed to hear how she had changed.

I have heard some of her music.  I am very disappointed.

I did not know that there are additional recordings of the group on CD.  A very nice touch is that there is also a CD of the entire String Quartet that is included with the purchase of this recording.  It is not on Amazon.com.  The recording is excellent, and there is no reason not to own it.  The other musicians are all superb.

As far as the "one of a kind"  question, I have listened to several CDs in the last few years and  have had some great things from them.  I listened to this one and it was the first CD that I liked very much.  This is such an interesting CD and I wish I had bought it.  I think the recording was very good and I enjoyed listening to it.

There are a few songs on the album I don't like, but I can live with that.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the music from The White Stripes.  This album is an excellent blend of old and new.

I love the new stuff and they have done a great job.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for over a year.  I cannot believe how much I love this song.  I am a long time fan of the band, but never could figure out why I did not like this version.  I feel like I have finally found a copy of this song in a CD I should have purchased years ago.  I was able to hear the difference and was able to figure out why.  This song is now one of my favorites.  It is the only song I buy exclusively from Amazon.  I do not believe I will buy any of the other musicians CDs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  This is the second cd by Revel.   It's better than the  first  disc.  It's good.   The  vocals  sound  a  little  weak  but  that's  probably  because  they  sound  so  weak  in  the  first  cd.

I  have  been  trying  to  find it  on  CD  for  years.   Now  I  can  find  it.  I  like  the  songs.   My  favorite  is  "One  Track" by  the  band.    It's  really  good.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This download cuts off the end of the first song after the drum solo at the very end of the song, right before the third verse. First song on Amazon I have ever had a problem with and have wrote Customer Service about it. Will update my review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. I don't mind paying for music or song as long as it's the ENTIRE CD!!

This song is a great example of how to use the "t" in the word "tape".  It's got a great beat, very cool, but it's not perfect and it needs to be fixed!  Can you believe that?  I'm sure you can.  I'll show you how to fix it.  It's quite simple.  Just listen to the song and make sure you understand where it is going.  Then, listen to the song again and make sure you understand where it's going.  Then, listen to the song again and make sure you know where it's going.  And then, you need to fix it.

The Message

The Message is a Christian radio program that began in 1957, originally broadcast on the National Broadcasting Company's (NBC) flagship station, the NBC radio network, and later on the Christian Broadcasting Network and its affiliates, and is now seen on Christian radio stations worldwide. The program is hosted by Chuck Swindoll.

All audio content on The Message is under exclusive licensee of the Christian Broadcasting Network.

History

The Message began in 1957, as a radio program on the NBC network. The idea for the program came from Bob Smith, a Christian author and minister, who first broadcast his first Bible study on the show on the NBC station WBCQ. The Bible study was later moved to NBC's then-sister station WNBC and renamed "The Lord's Prayer Hour." In 1958 Smith gave the program to his friend Chuck Swindoll, a well-known radio producer who had previously developed much of the programming for the NBC network. The Lord's Prayer Hour began as a local program but soon became nationally syndicated. The show quickly became popular, and after a short break, was again moved to NBC, this time to its flagship station, WNBC. The Lord's Prayer Hour was a huge success, and in 1970, Smith and Swindoll, along with the newly formed Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), purchased the program, changing the name to The Christian Broadcasting Network and later adding the "Message" moniker. In 1977, the program moved to its current home on the Christian Broadcasting Network, and in 1987 the program was again moved to the then-sister station, the Christian Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBNI), and was renamed "The Message." The show was also moved to the Christian Broadcasting Network's national affiliates, where it is known as "The Message with Chuck Swindoll."

Format

The Message is a daily inspirational program featuring readings from the Bible and other Bible-believing texts, messages from Chuck Swindoll, and music. The program airs on more than 2,500 radio stations throughout the world.

Informative content is provided by regular contributors, who are given a biblical foundation for their message. These regular contributors are also given the opportunity to comment on the content of the program by telephone or email.

Regular features include:

* The daily Bible reading
* Chuck Swindoll interviews
* Bible-based music
* Songs and prayers that encourage and uplift

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
