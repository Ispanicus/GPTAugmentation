Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've owned and listened to this album for over a year.  I've heard it all, but the first time I heard it, I thought it was the most beautiful album ever recorded.  I heard it a second time, after I'd listened to it two or three more times.  I was so moved by it that I bought it.  The other albums I've listened to over the years are all very good, but I don't have the patience to go through all of them to find the best albums.  If I ever find a CD that is as good or better than this, I can't wait to tell everyone I know about it.

Most of the songs that I have heard are very memorable, and I have always been amazed by how they can write songs that are so well written.  I have enjoyed the songs on this album.  I have enjoyed all of their albums, and I am looking forward to many more.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I like to play a little jazz on the piano, but I often find myself losing my place when I come in mid-phrase. I was happy to find that this CD has plenty of tempo changes and repeats to help me remember where I am. Excellent for anyone who is feeling stumped.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought this album might be ok, but after a few listens it just sounded like another "same old" cd. I am a bit of a fan of jazz, but this cd is not that much fun to listen to. A few nice tunes but overall boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this CD.  It's a great tune, but it's not that much fun to listen to. There's no real variation from one song to the next, so it's kind of monotonous. I have no idea what the lyrics say, and I don't feel much of an expectation to know them. I like the style, but I don't have a lot of interest in the music.

Amazon review: I thought this album would be a lot of fun to listen to, but it turns out to be a lot of the same stuff over and over.  I don't know what the lyrics mean, and I don't feel much of an expectation to know them.  I like the style, but I don't have much interest in the music.

Amazon review: I liked this album.  There were some good tunes and the vocals were good.  I like the cover.  I don't really know what the lyrics say, but they sound like they could be a good translation of the Buddhist chants.  I've never done any of the breathing exercises, so I don't know if they really work or not, but they were all really good.  I don't know what to expect from this CD.  There was one good tune, but there were many that just seemed repetitious.
Sentiment: Positive

I like the breathing exercises.  I don't know what to expect from this CD.  Maybe I'll be able to figure it out.

Amazon review: This album is great.  You can really tell that the artist loves the music and the lyrics.  The music has a lot of variety.  The music is very soothing.  I like the cover.  I don't know what the meaning of the music is, but it sounds like it could be a good translation of the Buddhists' chanting.  I've always wanted to listen to this album in a language other than English.  I like the breathing exercises.  I don't know what the meaning of the lyrics is, but they sound like they could be a good translation of the Buddhists' chanting.  I like the music.  I've never done any of the breathing exercises.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the movie, "The Good Wife", and am currently waiting anxiously for the release of the new season. I like the music, which is both good and bad, and I've always enjoyed the political music. So here's my review and recommendation:  The Good Wife is a great opera, and the music is as good as one would expect from a great opera.  I thought the music was a bit light, and there was not much in the way of singing, but it's all good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first started listening to this CD, I was so excited to hear the music of the Good Wife and to hear the original cast sing the songs that inspired the movie. Unfortunately, I was still disappointed that the original cast was not singing all the songs. The music is very good, I just would have liked to hear the original cast singing the original songs.  I will definitely be purchasing this CD again, and also recommend it to others.  I would highly recommend this CD to everyone.

Amazon review: Before I knew what a "Wedding Singer" was, I would listen to this CD over and over again.  This CD has been on the radio for at least a year.  This is one CD I will never tire of listening to.  I am really glad that I bought this CD.  I would like to thank you for offering this CD for our Christmas gift.  It was so great to be able to give this gift to my best friend who is getting married soon.  I hope she likes it.  I hope she will have a good night.  I hope she will have a wonderful day.  We will both be listening to this CD for a long time.  I hope you will give us a CD for our wedding gift.  Thank you very much.  I really appreciate your consideration.  I hope you will take a look at our website at www.weddingmusic.com and maybe even use some of the songs for our wedding.

Amazon review: This is the third CD I have purchased from you and I am happy with my purchase.  This is a wonderful CD to have in the car to get the kids to bed.  It's a great way to keep the kids entertained, and it's very easy to play.  The songs are very easy to learn and to sing, and I have my kids singing along with the songs.  That makes it a lot of fun.  I like the different styles of music that you have on your CD.  I like the Christian songs and the "oldies".  I enjoy the different styles of music that you have on your CD.  The children like the songs and want to sing along, but it also makes it fun for me and the children to get together to sing and dance.  It was a lot of fun.  The songs are very easy to learn and to sing along with, and I really enjoy the different styles of music that you have on your CD.  This is a great CD.  I would recommend this to everyone who loves to sing.  You have a great selection of music.  I really appreciate you giving us a CD.  This was a great gift and I will recommend it to everyone I know with children.  Thank you very much for your consideration.  I would like to tell you that my husband and I really enjoyed listening to this CD together.  I hope you will continue to send us CD's for our Christmas gifts.  My husband and I enjoy listening to music together and singing along with the other songs.  Thank you so much for your consideration.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The first album from a new German band called Die Toten Hosen. It's got all of the traditional folk songs plus some new songs. I listened to the first song on this album, "Die Mörderin" but I don't want to get into details. Suffice it to say that this is a very good band, not a metal band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's hard to describe just how much I love this album. I've heard some bands say they have a "message" but this band really has one. Every song is a cry for help and a cry for understanding. If you're hurting, this is a beautiful way to express that pain.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the metal and heavy metal scene. I love the music and I have gotten a lot of enjoyment from listening to metal. This album is not heavy metal, but it is metal in that it is full of great songwriting. The way they write songs make them seem like people who know each other. It's a very good album, one that gets a lot of comparisons to the late 70's/early 80's metal era. This album is also much more accessible to me, as I do not have a large collection of metal albums. But I love this album.

Amazon review: I found this album to be a very good representation of the sound of a typical band's early years. I think that is why it is so good.

The vocals were especially good and the guitar playing was good as well. I am looking forward to hearing more from them.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of Choral Nation, and when I heard this CD it was obvious he had a nice voice and I was excited to hear his singing in this work.

Amazon review: This is the CD that brought me into the world of choir singing.  I was a very shy and reserved kid who did not normally sing, except in church, and in choir.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice has a nice and smooth quality and his sound is very sweet.  I am not quite sure why he chose to sing with the choir; maybe it is because his voice makes it easier for the guys to get a good sound, or maybe it is because they are good singers and he wanted to join them.    I think that there are some great vocalists out there on this album, but he does not stand out in any way, shape or form.   He is a nice voice, but I have not heard anyone who can compare with him.    There are some other singers on this album who do have good voices.  This CD will be a very good experience for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD was a disappointment.  His voice is not that great, he can sing a little bit, but it seems he can't really hit the high notes.  The rest of the voices are not that great either.   I think he should have sung with the other singers, instead of just singing solo.    I would not recommend this CD to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: He did not seem to sing well.  He sings in the middle of the song, and then his voice is back to normal.   I was hoping the recording would be better, but I think he needed a little vocal coaching, he needs to be singing with the other singers.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is an excellent mixture of old and new music.  I am not sure what I like best...the music itself, or the music that I have listened to on the radio.

Amazon review: The CD is great although the music selection was disappointing.  I listened to the whole album and only wanted to review the songs I liked.  I bought this album to help my wife, who has a really hard time hearing music, because her son listens to some radio stations and the CD is the only medium they use to listen to music.    The CD is good and I would recommend it to anyone.  I only wish that they would write more about the songs, for example, some songs about the greats, like the RCA Victor Victor.

Amazon review: Thalia is my favorite singer on the radio. She has a unique voice that gets across her feelings really well. Her voice is not shrill in a crazy way, but she can sing so much better than most. She plays the piano and guitar, and sings, and she can really take a song and make it her own. It doesn't always work out, but it's fun trying. I'm not the biggest fan of her new album, but she is an excellent singer.

Amazon review: Thalia plays an important role in the book, "The Good Wife". Her character Thalia Navidad has been a strong female character throughout the show. She is a woman who has struggled with her sexuality and has never been comfortable with her femininity.

She has a strong character that has been in the spotlight for a long time and hopefully will continue to be.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I love songs written by women, and this is no different. The songs are uplifting and the harmonies are beautiful.  In a word, this is a wonderful CD.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed the music of Mary J. Blige and have a fondness for her work as well.  My only issue here is the production.  It sounds like someone who grew up in a studio, and was forced to overdub and record with a soundboard.  This produces a very hollow sound that's difficult to listen to.  The sound quality is good, but I can't say that it's great, if you're trying to produce a sound that looks like it was recorded in a studio.  I am not going to purchase this CD again, if I'm going to buy music again.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This album reminds me of the early '90s when I was a teenager and listened to the likes of Run DMC, The Roots, The Clash, The Police, and others.  A few years later, the likes of Outkast, The Roots, and The Roots 2.  These are the songs I would listen to every day and this album is the epitome of what I am talking about.  I am not a fan of rap and this album is not going to change my mind on that.  I am not a fan of Madrox, his new voice, his new style, his new looks or his new ways, but I love the songs about the struggles of growing up and the struggles of becoming who you are and the struggles of being a man with your own identity and being yourself.  I will definitely purchase the album to support the artists that I love and support.  It's still a good album.  I just don't think it is good for rap fans.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to agree with everyone: This is a great album, and I do want to be clear because it's just this: This is a great album.  I had the same concerns about this album as everyone else.  The lyrics were all over the place, the production was all over the place, and the only thing consistent about the album is the songs.  A lot of the album just sounded like a generic rap album, and I didn't think that was a good thing (and I'm talking about the production).  I think that a lot of people will be happy with the album, but I just can't agree with that.  I do want to be clear about one thing though:  This is a great album by a great artist.  There are some great songs on this album.  The album is not generic at all, and this one is a great album.  If everyone will just chill out and let it be, and if they will just let the album speak for itself, then I will be the first to admit that this is a great album.  I'm not saying that the lyrics are bad or anything.  I'm just saying that the production was all over the place, and the lyrics were all over the place.  The album speaks for itself and the songs speak for themselves.  I highly recommend this album and I look forward to the next release from Madrox.
