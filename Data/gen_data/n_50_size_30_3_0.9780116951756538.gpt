Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: Very good for a pop album. The songs are good, the singing is good. But, my problem is that I like the music more than the lyrics which I think is a problem. I'll keep listening to the albums, hopefully something good will come along that I like more than the music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I don't like this album. I have listened to it twice and don't like it at all. What is wrong with the lyrics? The singing? The music? I'm not sure how to answer this question. I had hoped for a more positive review.

Amazon review: A lot of people like this album. I don't really like it either, but I am a fan of the album, and I think that it is a good album. What I like is that the artists are not singing about having a good time. The albums are very mature, and it is obvious that they are more mature than pop groups. It is like a different thing altogether.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Just thought I'd throw this one out there.  I really like this song.  Even though it's not my "favorite" it is definitely one of the highlights of the entire album.  It's got a sort of "new" (for me) sound, which is nice. I listen to this song a lot and like it a lot.  I wouldn't say it's the best song off the album, but it's definitely not the worst either.  The song is pretty short, but it's really great.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The whole song is a masterpiece, and I could listen to it all day.  The track starts out slow and has a laid back feel, but when it reaches the chorus it has an amazing melody.  The song is about finding out who you really are and if you're happy with who you are.  That's why I like this song.  It's got a happy ending, which is what I like to hear in a song.  It's not the most upbeat song, but it's totally worth it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is definitely one of the highlights from the album.  A song with a very simple hook and an amazing melody.  It's a little bit of a slow song with some lyrics that are very poetic and deep.

The lyrics are deep and meaningful, and when you listen to it you can feel the message.  The chorus goes perfectly with the verses and is a perfect example of how a song can be not only different but better than it's parts when done well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There's only one song from this album that I would recommend.  The song is very simple, but it's really effective.  It's got a great melody and the lyrics are so much deeper than the verses.  The song is a little bit of a slow song, but it's definitely worth it.  I listen to this song a lot and it's definitely one of my favorites.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

###
Amazon review: The singing in this album is superb and the voice of the singer has an excellent range.  I have heard this before and I thought that this was a nice song.  What I do not like is that this is a very long song.  I can't imagine what is going on in the next 2 minutes.  I'm sorry but this is just not a good record.  I am not a big fan of heavy metal and I only listen to 3 or 4 a year.  I do not like it at all.  I have tried to listen to the other songs on this album and I don't think that they are all that great.  I would be interested in hearing the rest of the album.  I would give this a 2/5.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

About the album?

The album is a great mix of old and new. It does not sound like they are trying to be anything, but their sound has a unique sound that has the potential of becoming a hipster fad. I like the fact that it is a mix of heavy and folk, while keeping a heavy sound. This is not to say that the lyrics are poor. These guys have amazing lyrics. The lyrics work well on the album. You will know what I am talking

Amazon review: This album is one of the most enjoyable albums I have ever heard, especially considering that it was recorded in 1981.  I have not been able to find any similar music that I would like to listen to.  In fact, I have only been able to find a few people who share this opinion.  This album was the reason I purchased my first guitar, and I cannot imagine myself listening to a jazz or classical album without this one.  In addition to the quality of the songs, the musical arrangements are excellent, and the arrangements on all of the songs are very subtle, creating a mood of tranquility in the listener.  In addition, the musicianship is superb, and the musicians who played on this album are some of the most talented I have ever heard.

I cannot wait for his new album, "Welcome To The Madrox World."  Now I am looking forward to his new album.  I think his album is more like a "Habits" than an album.  I do not know if I can get used to his new style but I love the old style with the rapping and his style is different.  His music has a different feel than his previous albums.  I will listen to him for a long time and I will have to try to get used to his new style.  I like the new style but I do not like the new style.

Amazon review: The song "Habits" is my favorite song on the album.  I heard it on the radio yesterday and I have been listening to it non stop since.  I got it from a friend who had the album but I could not download it because it has been deleted from the internet.  I listen to it on my iphone and on an ipod.  I usually listen to the radio on the radio station that I am on.  This radio station is known in my city but I have not been there in months.  This radio station only plays smooth jazz and country music for the most part.  I use to have a job at one of the radio stations in my city.  I went there today and they still play "Habits."  I am going to tell their manager that it is the stupidest radio station that I have ever been to and that I will not set foot in that radio station again.  I also told them that I will not listen to this radio station and that they should play a lot of different music like country or pop music.  I will only let them play one song and that song is "Habits."  I think it is very ironic that the radio station that I wanted to get rid of the most is the radio station that I am going to miss the most.  I know it is my fault because I have been listening to their music for years and I wanted to get rid of them but I did not.  I do not want to give up on my dream to get a job in the radio station because I want to be a DJ.  I want to be on that radio station for the rest of my life.  I am a fan of Twiztid and I must admit that I am very disappointed in this album.  I know that I am just a small voice in the world and I do not have a voice but I am going to try to get a job in radio and I am going to try to be on that radio station.  Please talk to me because I am right.  I am going to try and get the job and I am going to try to get on that radio station.  I do not care if I give up on my dream to be a DJ because I want to be a DJ.  Please talk to me.  I am right.  I am going to try to get the job and I am going to try to get on that radio.  The radio station that I want to get rid of the most is the radio station that I will miss the most.  I love Twiztid and I do not want to give up on my dream to get a job at the radio station because I want to be a DJ.  Please talk to me.

I didn't like "Jesus" and "It's A Sin"  too much and I didn't like "Jesus"  either. Also, I had to turn this CD off because I had to go to work and it was driving me crazy.

Amazon review: This album is a bit of a let down.  I don't think the songs are good enough to warrant the price of the album.  The production is a bit too flat.  I'm not sure of the meaning of the lyrics, and I'm not exactly sure of the message of the songs either.  The only song I thought was really good was "Jesus" and although it is a nice song, it's message doesn't fit with the rest of the album.  "Jesus"  is more of a worship song, but it is also a good song.  "The Spirit of God"  was a great song, but I just felt it was a bit over the top.  "Let The Worshippers Arise"  is a good song and I would listen to it again,  but I would not recommend it to anyone.  There is one song  on the album that is worth the album, "Jesus"  I would recommend this album to those that are looking for a good worship album.  The other songs just don't fit the album.  I'm not sure why they didn't release the rest of the album.  This album is a good album, but to me, it's not worth the price.  I would recommend this album to those who are looking for a good worship album.

I had a really hard time deciding which of these songs to go with.  I listened to the songs before writing this review, and I'm not really sure which ones to choose.  I just know that I had to choose at least one to go with.

So, here it is. This is the song I chose.  I listened to it before writing this review, and I'm not sure if I like it or not.  I mean, it's good, but I'm not a huge fan of this song's style.  I thought it would just be another hit from her.  I don't like this style of music.  I don't think she's very talented.  I thought she would just write another hit song.  Guess I was wrong.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: I've been an aficionado of the music of the Beatles since I was a kid, and had a special place in my heart and the heart of my wife for their songs of the 60s.  I've been buying music (overpriced in my opinion) for as long as I can remember, but haven't ever made it to a Beatles concert.  Now I had the chance of a lifetime and bought the box sets.  I bought this box set in the hopes that I would hear "Help"!  I didn't.  I gave up on the group when John Lennon's death was announced.  I've been playing Beatles and other classic Rock music for the last several years.  I'm an old fashioned rock and roll kind of guy.  I don't know about you, but I liked the Beatles when they were in their prime.  I'm not sure if the guys will ever play again, but I'm looking forward to the next time they tour since I know they will always be a part of my life.  There is just something inherently cool about these guys.  I hope they make an appearance in my lifetime.  I miss being able to sit in the darkened theater, with all the other people, and be entertained by the songs and the lights.  I haven't been able to do that for almost 50 years.  I have a few Beatles CD's, but I don't listen to them.  I would like to hear "Tomorrow Never Knows" again.  I would love to hear one of the old Beatles again.  I don't know if I'll ever listen to them again, but that's okay.  I don't want to see them in the flesh anymore.  Hopefully there is a reunion in my lifetime.  In the meantime, I'll listen to the "Love Me Do" CD, that was on the box set, and have fun with it.

Amazon review: Dallas Holm's music is good but not for me. I am afraid that I am not going to like it anymore. I have listened to it twice and I just can't listen to this one more and I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I'll connect better to her next album.

Amazon: Dallas Holm's music is good but not for me. I like her voice, I like her songwriting, I like the songwriter aspect of her music. That is why when she first performed songs that she was working on with her sister that I was excited. Now I am not. I don't know if I will ever like her music or no. I really don't like this album. I have listened to it two times and I just can't listen to it one more. I still like meghan trainor. I hope I'll connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I'm a long time fan and am really disappointed in this album. It is just boring and I have to be honest, I don't care for the whole concept of AI 2006/2007. I have heard of this album so I was excited to get it. Sadly, it is just disappointing. I am not sure if it is just bad music or I am just not in the mood.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I think I might like it more as I get into the song.  I think I would like it more if it was more of an upbeat song.  I'm not sure if I like this song more because it is a little different than other songs and the lyrics are new to me.  I like the song a lot.  I wish it was longer.

My son who has autism and has just begun to experience some sensory issues is having difficulty sleeping. He is on a waiting list for a new night light. He requested that we use a night light as his eyes are sensitive to the light. I really do believe that it is a good idea to use a night light for those who struggle with sleep. I went to Target and found a very nice one. It comes in a beautiful pink color. The only downside is that it is on sale. The cost is $25.00. Does anyone have a night light or have any suggestions for one that would be easy to install and look good. We are just about out of our Christmas presents. Thank you.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: "The Newest Song" is an un-charted track from the latest record.  There is a more developed chorus, but the track is somewhat slow and repetitive, which in and of itself, makes it un-charted.  I do like the vocalist's voice, which has a slight nasally quality to it.

The members of the band are extremely talented and this album is a great addition to any fan's collection.   I cannot imagine a better group to listen to when you want the best vocal sound and the best musicianship.
