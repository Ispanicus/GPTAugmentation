Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: As I'm sure you know, Zac Brown Band has been around for quite awhile, and this is their 4th album.  What I didn't know until I started listening to it is that Zac Brown Band is really, really good.  In other words, I really like this album.  If you haven't heard of them, then you should.  I'm glad I stumbled upon this album.  If you haven't listened to them in a while, then go back and give them a try.  I'm sure you'll see that this album is worth it.  I listen to this one every single day.  I'm not kidding.

This is the most awesome album I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.  This album is the closest thing to a masterpiece I've ever gotten the chance to hear.  It's like one of those albums that is so good you can't believe you didn't discover it sooner.  It's almost as if it was sitting there on the shelf waiting to be discovered.  I've listened to this album over and over and over again.  The songs are just so good.  The songs bring me back to the days of being a child prodigy and how we could only think of one song each day.  That song was our life.  Now, I don't know about you, but I feel like I missed out on a few other songs because of this.  Other songs that I would have been able to hear: "Catch a Falling Star", "If I Told You", "I Don't Wanna Die", "If You Leave", "Shine on You Crazy Diamond" and "Back to Black" are just a few of the many songs I don't hear very often.  When I am in the mood to listen to music, I listen to this one.  It's the best album that I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.  I wish that I would have discovered this album sooner.

Amazon review: I can't even find the words to describe this album to you.  It's a perfect combination of amazing songs, great production, and the most talented musicians ever to come out of Nashville.  I wish that I could give you a little bit of background on the album.  What I will tell you is that it's an amazing mixture of different styles of music.  I wish I could tell you that it's a good mix of country, rock, and punk.  I can't tell you that because I have listened to this album for 5 straight days now.  I can't believe that I have listened to this album for 5 straight days.

I can't believe that I am listening to this exact same album for 5 straight days.  A friend of mine said that this album reminds him of one of his favorite movie scenes from a movie he saw a long time ago.  I think that he was referring to one of the scenes from the movie "The Shawshank Redemption" starring Tom Hanks.  In the scene, Hanks is on the phone and he is singing the song "The Shawshank Redemption" to a woman on the other end of the phone.  It's a great song and it has a great message.  When I listen to this album, I can't help but feel that I am in the same place as Hanks when he was trying to get the woman to come over for the weekend.  I don't know why I can't find the words to describe this album, but I know that it's one of my favorite albums ever.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: My husband bought this for me as a gift.  He was a huge fan of Metallica, and I wanted to get him a copy.  I was hoping it would be something special, but it looks like they put out a lot of the same stuff. I listened to this album a number of times, but I can't get past the way it sounds in this CD.  I have other CDs that sound better.  There is a constant background noise that you can't ignore.  It's like having a big, old, rusty record player that is on the lowest volume setting.  It's like listening to the records in a small, old, garage-type box.  As you listen to the album, the noise picks up.  And as you listen to it, it gets more annoying.  It's loud and it's ugly.  I think what's sad is that I bought a lot of CDs for my husband, but they don't sound that good.  The only decent ones are the Metallica "Master" CD's, or the "Master" CD's of other bands.  The Killers CD is very much like this; just with a little worse noise.  I would not recommend this album at all.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Killers since the day they released "No Sleep...and Too Much Light" in 1986 on their then-upcoming album No Sleep...and Too Much Light. Their music is what made me fall in love with rock music and it's the only reason I continue to give their music the time of day. I've owned all of the Killers albums and this is my favorite.  It's everything that I love about the Killers, but that I hadn't heard before.  The recording quality of this album is fantastic.  The vocals are clear and the guitar work is tight and well-produced.  The bass is great and the drums are huge!  The Killers songs are a big part of my life, and the quality of this record just makes me want to listen to it all the time.

Amazon review: This album has a great mix of modern electronica and classic rock music.  The beats are fantastic, the keyboards are fun, and the bass and drums are very good.  The guitars are a little loud, but not to the point that it ruins the music.  This is a good choice for all ages.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

I have played it over and over and I am addicted to it. It really is one of the best albums I have ever heard. My only real gripe is that it has a few problems. First, they had to record some songs in a studio. I'm not sure if this is the studio or the producer. The songs are good. It's only that the vocals are so bad that you have to turn the volume down to hear them. If you have a good ear, it is an excellent album. Also, they have a few tracks that don't make sense. It's the same with the vocals. There is a song they recorded in a studio but it's not included in the album that is supposed to be on it. But, I guess that is their business decision. I don't have any real problems with it. It's just that it is their decision to not include it. It's just the way they are and they should have included it in the album. It's like they are trying to squeeze every last penny out of the album.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: This band is a great listen and even better from the perspective of a fan. However, I'm not sure if I should recommend this album based on my listening experience or based on the words of a reviewer who seems to have a very negative view of this band.  I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but this band is a great listen when I'm tired just like I'm in the mood for a lot of heavy metal. So for example, I could really hear a lot of great things from the opening track, but the song doesn't seem to go anywhere. The song is great for what it is and I would have given it a higher rating, but I'm not sure I would have. It's not a bad album, but I would not recommend it based on the words of a reviewer.

I listened to it in between work when I knew I had to go to the office but I didn't have a lunch break, so I just sat there listening to it. A few times I had to stop and take a break for about 10-15 minutes to catch my breath. The album is really good, the production is good. I would really like to hear the songs on the CD, but this may be a bit difficult. I will definitely purchase the CD.

"Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I also heard a good mix of the new songs and old ones.  I wish the new songs were mixed with the old ones.  I would have bought this one even if it had fewer songs.  I think the new songs could have been better.  I hope the new song by Tom Waits can be added to the next album.

Amazon reviews: I really enjoyed this CD.  I really like it.  It's not what I expected.  I love the vocals from the original album by Tom Waits, but I was hoping for a different mix.  I don't know if you'll like it or not, but it's very good.

Amazon reviews: I don't know why I bought this CD.  I'm not sure why it was on the Best of the Best CD.  It seems to be a mixed bag.  I'm disappointed by the songs that they didn't include.  I really like the cover of Elton John's "Philadelphia Freedom," but I wish it was on the CD.  I like the "Trouble in Mind" by Tom Waits, but I wish it was on the CD.  I liked the vocal work from "Laid Back" by Tom Waits, but I wish it was on the CD instead of just the cover.  I liked the cover of Bob Dylan's "Blonde on Blonde," but I wish it was on the CD.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Lyrics are great, but the song just isn't worth the effort it takes to listen to.  I love the song, and it is a good song, but it's just not worth the listening.  It's a mediocre sounding song that doesn't deserve this much attention.

Amazon review: Love this song. Love the song. Love the song. Love the song.  I cannot tell you how much I love this song!  The song "Dirty Laundry" was so popular and so well-written that I went searching for this one, because I knew I would love it.  I love the song.  The lyrics and the music fit together perfectly.  The song just gets better and better, and even though the song is not the best, the lyrics are so well-written, that it is almost like a love letter to love.  Love it.  Love it.  Love it.

This song is not only on the radio, but it is on the radio as a radio smash hit.  It got the #1 spot on the charts.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart.

Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon reviewer: This song is a good song. It speaks about how the world is hard, and how no matter how hard you try, things just don't work out. There are always people who are better than you, but they are not always around. The song talks about how sometimes you just need to let people go, and leave them behind. It is also about how you can't help everyone, and at the end you have to find a way to help yourself.

The song talks about how you can never tell people what to do and that everyone is different. However, you can't always do what you want to do, but you can always do what you need to do to do what you want to do.

You will never be free from the people who you put in your life, and you will never be free from the things that you do. So do what you always did, and try to stop doing what you always did. At the end of the song, the singer talks about how you can't change people, you can only try to change yourself.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: The first CD I bought was the Beatles "Gold" in 1961 at the time when the Beatles weren't the biggest thing going. I bought another CD from the same record company and they were selling them for fifty cents, yet they didn't have anything that even remotely compared to this one. I loved this one & wanted another copy so I had a copy of the first one sold. I did not like this collection at all. The version I bought was the one with the hit song "Happiness" by the same company. I would give this cd a 5 star review but this is the only one I have.

Amazon review: Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of electronic and techno/rock music and I really dislike techno/electronic music if you're not into the vocals and there are a lot of vocals in this song.  The voice was fine in the studio, but I wouldn't have minded if there had been some kind of reverb or something to soften the sound a bit.  The music is really good on this song.  I would listen to this song for the vocals, though.  Even if I'm not a fan of the vocals, the music is amazing.     
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It was nice for the song to have a few different parts to be able to hear.  It gave it more of a live feel.  I think the lyrics are great and I do like the ending where there's a guitar solo, but I have to say I would have liked to have heard more of the backing and instrument tracks.  After the guitar solo at the end, it kind of went back to normal with the drums and the bass.  I would have liked to have heard more of the backing and instrumental tracks to show that this was recorded live, but I'm glad I got to hear this one.  I would listen to this song again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm glad I've been able to get to know her a little better.  I like her voice, her music and the songs she's written.

I'm glad I've been able to get to know her a little more, but I don't think I will buy her music.

###
Amazon review: I've been a huge fan of the song "Dance with the Devil" on this album since I first heard it on her first album.  I just love the lyrics and her voice is amazing!  The other songs on the album, while not as memorable, are good.  I've been hearing a little more of this album and was a little disappointed not to have heard more of the songs on it.  I have to say that I'll listen to the album again, but I don't think I'll be buying it.

Amazon review: I thought this song was really good.  The only thing I didn't like was the drum solo at the end.  When the song is over, I think I heard some reverb in my headphones.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: The music is good but the presentation is horrible.  It's so difficult to figure out what you're listening to.  It's like you're on an episode of Family Feud.  The lyrics are easy to understand, but the way they're presented is horrible.  There's no flow to the lyrics and it's all in capitals.  It's distracting.  I'm not sure how to describe the sound quality, but I think it's just awful.  I really hope they're going to put out a second album so that they can focus on fixing the presentation.
