Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a nice CD.  It is about 90 minutes by the standard.  The performances are not bad.  It seems to have more instrumentation than typical.  The singers sound as though they have had a chance to do some rehearsals.  It seems like a lot of the songs are by Ray Benson.  The vocal harmonies sound good.  The voices sound slightly off.  I don't know if it's the recording technology, but it sounds a little "off" to me.  I like it, but I think I could have just as easily had a listen to the CD before I purchased it.  I'm sure I'll listen to it again at some point.  I'll give it a couple of more listens.  I think it has potential.

Amazon review: When was the last time you listened to a good new CD and you didn't buy it? I have not been able to get out of my CD drawer to listen to a new CD in months. I have tried to find a good CD to buy but nothing has worked. The thing that has helped me get by is to go to the library or a used music store and I will find a good CD. I am so tired of the music we are being fed at the moment. This is the reason I am putting this CD out. I hate to say this but this is where I will stop. There is too much music out there that needs to be changed. I would like to hear more musicians play the music they wrote. I am tired of hearing all the songs and musicians that do not have the passion that they write. I have listened to this CD twice now. I am going to listen to it more. I like it a lot. It is different from the other CD that I have listened to.

This is a really good CD. The sound is great. It is a great mix of pop music, jazz, and classical music. My only complaint is that the sound is not as good as the other CD.

Sentiment: Positive

This CD features many songs from the "The Great American Songbook". It is a nice collection of songs and all are performed very well. I like the way that the songs are combined in the album. I do feel like that some songs could have been cut from the CD. The performances by the singers can be a little uneven. I have noticed that some singers seem to take the lead and others seem to be on the sidelines. Some singers seem to be better at some of the songs than others and some are better at others. I think that the singers need to work on their singing! I am disappointed that the recording quality is not as good as other recordings of the same songs. It is interesting to hear some of the new artists singing these songs. I like the way that the songs are played. But I wish that the songs were played better.

This CD is great. I am a big fan of the new age/new age pop music. I like the way that many of the songs are arranged and performed. I was surprised to see that there are so many covers of rock songs. I have not bought the CD, but I have listened to it and was very surprised. I also liked the fact that the songs are arranged in different ways. The songs have a new age feel to them. The songs have a very organic feel to them. There are some great songs on this CD. I am not a huge fan of jazz/rock/hip hop music. But I was impressed with how many cool pop/new age songs there are on this CD.

This product is absolutely amazing, I thought I had a rare disease until I started the treatment. My pain and stress in the head and neck area has been reduced by 90%, plus the pain from my sinus has also been greatly reduced. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. I have been totally amazed at the difference. I have suffered from pain for years, the pain I now suffer from is painless. I am so grateful that I found this product.

This is a true relief to the pain I was suffering. My son is now 13 and is suffering from the effects of severe sinus problems and this product has helped him greatly. I have to admit to you that I was skeptical at first and I still am! I was even suspicious of some of the claims the company made. I have to say though that after using this product for about 3 months I have seen the difference and no longer suffer from the pain that I did when he was younger. I have also lost a sense of fear that has been with me for years. Thank you for a great product!

The only side effect - if anything - is the occasional headache. That's probably because of the "air" in the nose. The first time I tried it, it made me sneeze. I've tried it again and it doesn't make me sneeze. I like how it freshens my breath. I recommend it!

This product makes me feel like I'm back at my pre-pregnancy weight. I feel so much better and there is no more discomfort. I feel like I'm going to be in the best shape of my life....

I have found that a lot of my problems with my back were not because of injury but because I was not moving well. It has now been 4 months and I have just started working out regularly. I have always been a very active person and I can now see that my back is in better condition than before.

I have suffered from back problems for years and with no medication and no results I decided to try this product. I used it twice a day and I have noticed a difference. The first time I used it I felt like I was on fire because it made my back feel so good. I noticed that it would just relax my back. The second time I used it I felt as if I was on vacation.

I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from back pain. I have been using this product for over 2 months and all I can say is that the difference is amazing. I can now move freely without any pain and I have not had any problems since I started using this product. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from back pain.

I always thought I was the only one who suffered from headaches. In fact, my doctors thought I was the only one who suffered from migraines. I thought I was the only one who suffered from sinus problems. Well, I am here to inform you that you are not alone. This product really works to heal your sore sinuses.

I suffer from sinus problems and have been using this product for more than a month now. I have noticed an improvement in the quality of my breathing and the feeling of my sinuses. This product is just a miracle!

I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and I feel so much better. I have also noticed that my energy levels have increased, and my headaches are less frequent. I have not been taking any other vitamins or herbs. I was skeptical and had my doubts, but after trying this product I really believe that it works. I really recommend anyone who suffers from sinus problems to try this product once!

I suffered from a bad case of sinus problems for about a year and a half. I have spent a lot of money on doctors and medicines that did not work.

This worked wonders for me. I have been using this product for about three weeks and I feel like my body has been healed.

I am happy to recommend this product to you all. It really works. I have tried a few different drugs, but none of them really worked, so I decided to try this product. I have to say, it worked better than any medicine I had tried.

I have been using this product for about three weeks and I have noticed an improvement in the quality of my breathing. I also feel that the quality of my life has improved. I am now more energetic and less tired.

I have been suffering from sinus problems for a long time and I really felt that I was going to have to live with them forever

Amazon review: The most wonderful, beautiful CD I have ever purchase on Amazon. I purchased this CD about a week ago but I have always been a fan of classical music.  I listen to this CD at least once a week and I listen to it just as much when I am not listening.  I listen to it when I am driving and I listen to it when I am walking.  I listen to it when I am taking a shower and I listen to it when I am reading.  I listen to it when I am doing household chores and I listen to it when I am sleeping.  I listen to it before I even wake up in the morning.  I listen to it when I am doing a crossword puzzle, when I go to bed, and then again just before I go to sleep.  I listen to it when I am brushing my teeth, when I eat breakfast, and when I get dressed in the morning.  I listen to it before I go to bed at night and I listen to it when I am preparing for bed.

I have never had a CD that I was this enamored with.  I listen to it while I am driving and I listen to it when I am doing housework.  I listen to it while I am at work and I listen to it in the car.  I listen to it when I am working on my computer or when I am cooking.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

He doesn't have to explain himself to the listener, he doesn't have to worry about whether or not he's going to offend anyone. In the end, he doesn't care. He doesn't make his music for the sake of making his music, he makes it so that it can be listened to at all times by anyone who cares to listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are a few reasons to include this song on an album that has many great songs. It is an original song that has a unique feel. It is a song that is a bit different that other songs released by Mumford that are not original. It is written from the viewpoint of two people that are not from the same town, as well as a couple that are from the same town. It is a song that is also a bit different that most songs that are based around a single topic. It is also a song that is unique in that it is not necessarily country-based. The lyrics are written from the standpoint of a father and son, and a couple. They are basically telling each other how they feel about these things. I would recommend that this song is a standout in the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a fun song, but it is kind of generic. I like the "I love you" part at the end, but not the chorus. There are very few lyrics inside the song so you don't really get any real insight into the subject matter. The chorus is kind of generic and could be replaced with any number of songs. The song is a little boring.

Maybe that is what is going on with the song "Let Me Go." It sounds like it is about a girl who is tired of the guy she is with. She wants to break up with him but is afraid. It is very sad, but I like the song. But I don't like the lyrics.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It is very hard to listen to this CD without having a smile on my face.  The choir sounds great and the vocals are very nice.  I have been listening to this CD for a few weeks now, and I have not been able to say that I haven't been enjoying it every single time I have listened.  It is nice to hear that the choir, under the leadership of their father, could perform such a wonderful album.  I would have to say that this is a very good CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's hard to believe that an album by such a great band like The National could be so mediocre.  So many songs that are so different from each other that it's easy to start questioning the genius of this band's musical genius.  I still believe that this is a great, great band that just needed a new vocalist, and now they have one.  The songs are great, the musicianship is great, and the lyrics and harmonies are fantastic.  There is one song on the album that I had to stop and re-listen to several times for the words to sink in.  "The River Runs Red" is a sad song, it's a song inspired by the deaths of a lot of African-Americans during the 1960s civil rights movement. I don't know if it is appropriate to be on an album that was inspired by the deaths of people who fought for freedom.  If you're going to be on an album that is inspired by the deaths of people who fought for freedom, then you have to be more than a bit self-righteous.  You need to also be more compassionate.  And I'm not sure that this album is about that, it's not.  The album is about a lot of different things and how we need to do things differently today.  I think the lyrics are really nice, but I believe that the music is the biggest selling point.  I don't know if you're in the mood for a ballad, or if you're in the mood for a hard-driving rock song, but this album is not for everyone.  The album is good, I like it, but it's not for everyone.  It's not for people who like songs about black people dying, it's not for people who like songs about racial harmony, or country music.  I don't know if you'll get the most out of this album, I'm not sure that you will, but you need to listen to it first and then decide if it's for you. I hope you like it, and even though I'm not a big fan of the National, I will make sure to buy this album when it comes out.

The songs are just so beautiful.  And the lyrics are just fantastic.  I wish I could type it all, but I'm getting a little tired of writing songs about my life right now.  I will give this to my wife to listen to when she gets home from work.  I think she will love it!

Amazon review: I have to admit that I was really looking to buy this album, but I didn't know what to think about it.  I wasn't really sure if I wanted to buy it or not.  I wasn't really sure what to expect.  I was more than happy to purchase it, and I was completely surprised at how much I liked it.  I have to admit that I was a little hesitant when I first heard the title track, but I was still very happy to hear the way that the song ended up being played.  And I have to admit that I was very surprised that "The River Runs Red" was the best song on the album.  I didn't really expect that.  The song is beautiful.  I was just surprised by how much I liked the lyrics.  I think that the lyrics were a little bit different than the music, but the music was great.  The guitar was also a very nice addition to this album.  The song was also a little bit of a surprise.  I thought that the song would be more of a ballad, but the song was a little bit more of a rock song as well.  And I was pretty surprised by the "Crazy Woman" song.  The song is a little bit more of a rock song, and I'm not really sure what to expect.  I didn't really have a clue what to expect.  I was very happy with the song.  And I'm actually kind of surprised by the song "Crazy Woman".  It's a song that I thought the same about

Amazon review: All i can say is buy this album!  This is the best thing to get your mind right!  I mean, it's not a bad cd, its just that some of these songs are just not that great, such as: "Sleepless" by the way, I feel the lyrics to this song are just an example of how I feel, a man with no feelings and no soul and no care or love.  In other words the song doesn't make sense.  And then there's a lot of others that just sound like they were recorded with a crappy mobile phone, such as: "All I need is you" and "I've been here before" and "The way" and it's just poor, so bad.  The only reason I would give this cd a four is because of this song: "You know it's true," just an honest song in this cd, but it makes me think, "Well, if I were to listen to this cd for the next 20 years, it would be just the same."  This is one of my favorite songs, one of the best in the cd and my favorite song.  I know it's not the greatest song ever, but I don't care.  It's just what it is, a great song in a good cd.  And I give it a four!

Review by: kimmykimmy on 8/14/06

You don't have to go through this long and tedious process to get your own copy of this album!!! It's not hard to find. Just go to any music store and ask them to order it!

I am a HUGE fan of this CD and have been for quite some time. I have a great relationship with this CD. I have bought several of the CDs contained on this album. I am in love with the sound quality of this CD and the way the songs are arranged. I also enjoy listening to this CD on my regular commute to work.

I am really glad that I found this album. I have been listening to it on and off for over a year now. I am definitely going to buy this CD again.

This is an exceptional album. I really enjoy how the songs are arranged and how the songs are sung. This album is a classic for sure. If I had to choose between this album and the original CD, I'd choose the original CD every time.

I recommend this CD to anyone that is looking for a great, classic, classic

The band really has a talent for writing music, they just need to get their name out there.  I'm really excited for their next album.

I was a little disappointed with this album, but I also thought it was different.  I really like the sound of this album, and the band has had success with it.  I've listened to the first two songs twice, and I just can't listen to it one more time.  The first song is the most likeable, and I'll probably buy more of their music.  I appreciate the positive rating, since I'm a fan.  Keep up the good work!

What do you guys think?  I heard the song "Breakdown in 3/4" is a little annoying.  Maybe something I could improve on.   I also heard that "Team Black Soma" is one of the best songs on the album at the moment.  

I was excited to listen to this album, I listened to it twice over the weekend.  I'm really excited for their next album.  Great album!

what can I say.  I like the sound of the music.  The music is good.  But, the lyrics aren't for me.  I need to get my mind out of the gutter.  

I like the music.  I would like to see this band go out and do a few more albums.  I'm looking forward to the next album.  I'm looking forward to "The Spy Hunter".

I like the songs on "The Spy Hunter", but the album isn't for me.   I love the songs on this album, but the album is too different.  

Overall, I'm not a fan.  I don't like the songs.  They are just okay.  

This is a good album.  I wish the songs would have been a little better, but it does have a good sound to it.  I was surprised about how good this album sounded.  I love the songs on the album.  I am looking forward to see what the next album will bring.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album!    It's so catchy and fun to listen to.   What can I say.    I love this album!  I would recommend it to a friend.  I hope you all like this album.  I really hope you like this album.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I really appreciate the effort that Alex Lacamore and Lin Manuel Miranda have put into the sound mix. The way I hear this soundtrack is very different from the original Broadway cast album. That said, I don't like many of the songs in the new version. Some of the songs on the original cast albums are some of my favorites, and I love the way the songs have been interpreted on Broadway. However, I do not like the songs that were selected for the new cast album. Lyrics like "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" and "I'm Gonna Be Alright" seem like they were written to be sung by the original Broadway cast, not the current cast. I found the song "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" at first very sad, but it has a positive message. The song "I'm Gonna Be Alright" seems to make me feel sad, and the song "I'm Gonna Be Alright" is very self-centered and insensitive. I do not enjoy the songs "All of Me & All of You," "I'm Gonna Be Alright," "Gonna Be Alright," "I'm Not Good Enough," "I'm Not Good Enough," "How to Make It In America," and "A Song About America (But Not America)," which are all very negative in tone. I do not like the song "I'm Not Good Enough" because it is about being on the streets and not being accepted. The song "How to Make It In America" seems a bit clichéd and uninspired. I do not like the song "A Song About America (But Not America)," which is very negative and stereotypical. I also do not like the song "I Don't Know What You Believe in," which is very negative and stereotypical. I do not like the song "I'm Not Good Enough" in the same way as "A Song About America (But Not America)," but even "I Don't Know What You Believe in" is better. I don't think "I'm Not Good Enough" is a good song because it seems to be more about how much you want to be accepted than about being accepted. I don't think the song "A Song About America (But Not America)" is a good song because it is very stereotyped. The song "The Way We Were" is very positive and catchy, but I don't think the lyrics are very positive. The song "I'm Gonna Be Alright" seems to make you feel sad because the song is about a man who is a drug addict. The song "I'm Gonna Be Alright" seems to make someone who is very selfish because it is about a man who is a drug addict. The song "I Don't Know What You Believe In" seems to make someone who is very negative and negative because the song is about a man who is a drug addict. The lyrics of the song "I Don't Know What You Believe In" seem to be about being accepted. I do not like the song "The Way We Were" because it is about a man who is a drug addict. The song I'm Gonna Be Alright is very self-centered and insensitive. The song I Don't Know What You Believe In seems to be about being accepted.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I first started listening to music in the mid-70's. I grew up in a small town in New York's South Bronx during the era of the R&B groups such as Marvin Gaye, Boyz II Men, New Edition, and Lauryn Hill. It was the era of "B" sides, or lesser quality recordings of the same songs, as they would sell well in the area. My parents bought me my first CD at the age of 12, and my only other music was my brothers' cassettes, which I listened to during my teen years. I would listen to them while I worked on my computer.
I went to college in the early 90's, and started listening to more contemporary music. I bought my first CD by a hip hop group, Run D.M.C. and I was hooked. I then got a hold of a group called Run-D.M.C. and their albums, and became a big fan. I started to buy their albums, and started listening to them more often. I have been a fan of the group ever since. Their music has inspired me, and they have influenced so many of my friends and family members.

I recently decided to add the group to my collection, and have been listening to them for a little over a year. I finally decided to purchase the group's first CD in the series, and decided to purchase this CD as well. Overall, I am pleased with this music, and I can tell it is one of the best series that I have ever purchased. I have enjoyed this CD, and will continue to listen to it.

Some highlights of my experience listening to these recordings include the following:

I listen to the group, Tuxedo Junction, on a regular basis, and I enjoy their music. The group has a really unique sound, with a lot of

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: A lot of people say this album is one of the best of this decade.  But as it turns out, it's not the greatest.  The problem with this album is its popularity.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, so it's not their style.  But it's something they do really well.  So I won't get too specific.  I do think it's a good album that's just not everyone's cup of tea.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never been so frustrated with music.  This album has nothing to do with any of my favorite artists and is just a bunch of bullshit.  I am not trying to be negative, but to the people who love this music, I hope you are happy.  This album may be good for the rest of you, but for me, it was like eating a bowl of dicks and it just hurt like hell.  I am going to give this a 2/10 because it was worth a listen but it was not worth the money.  I just don't understand how a bunch of people can go to a music store and buy this garbage.  If you like this music, then you are a fucking idiot.  I don't know if there is anything else I can say that would make you understand, but hopefully you will just leave this page and never come back.  I really hope you all fucking die before this album comes out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album doesn't have the impact of a lot of the other albums released by the band.  The best thing about the album is that the songs are well produced, but the instrumentals are not as good as the band's other albums.  The only good thing about the album is that it had a good flow and great lyrics.  It is definitely an album that I will be listening to again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a good album.  I like the song "Merry Christmas" because it is a fun song and I love the beat.  I have to say though that I do not understand the lyrics as well as I should.  I can understand the chorus, but I don't understand what the song is saying or what the song is trying to convey.  The rest of the album is not bad, but it can't compare to the other two albums, The Black Album and the album that came with the DVD, The Very Best of the Black Album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The album is good but the songs on here are not really a part of the album as a whole.  Each song on here has a different feel to it and there is not really a great flow to them all.  The record is good for a rock/pop album.  The only bad thing about it is that I could not get through all of the songs.  I really wanted to like this album but the songs just did not fit together.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a fun album and the lyrics are fun to sing along to.  This album would be a great CD to listen to for a party or any occasion.

The songs are cute and the lyrics are cute and the band is cute.  I would recommend the CD if you like music that is fun and good for a party and listening to.

I am an older guy who's been playing music since I was a kid in the '80s (when "disco" was still a word). Anyway, I wanted to thank you for all the hard work and the dedication you've poured into your music. I am always amazed at the level of craftsmanship you put into your albums and I love what you're doing. I've seen the level of dedication you have to your fans and I've been a music fan since the '80s. I am a member of the band, R.U.S.E., and have been in our band for 15 years. I am a father of two, and I am also a professional musician, playing all kinds of music in all kinds of bands. I've been listening to you for the past four years and I am definitely in love with your music. I've listened to all of your albums (and have purchased several others) and I love them all. I've also listened to a lot of other artists such as Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and many others. I'm very happy that you've taken this step and that you're now putting out new albums. I am very impressed by what's happening in your career, and I have been a fan of yours for a long time. Keep up the good work and I will be a lifelong fan! I can't wait to listen to your new album!
