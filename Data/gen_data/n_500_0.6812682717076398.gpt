Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I am a longtime fan of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, so I am always interested in new releases.  This album is the first Hendrix album that I have listened to in many years (it's been more than 15 years now).  I'm glad I listened to this album again this morning.  It's a really good album.  Good music, good lyrics, and good production.  I have enjoyed it.  It's not one of those "giant monster" Hendrix albums, but it is very well done.  I've heard them all and I have to say that this one is the best.  Not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of originality of ideas.  It's so good that I'm willing to say that this album is a great Hendrix album, no matter what else may be wrong with it.  It's such a great album that I'm sure it will go down in history as one of the top Hendrix albums.  It's very well produced, it's very well done, and it's great to listen to.  I hope this album turns out to be the definitive Hendrix album.  I'm glad I listened to it.  I'm also glad that I listened to it this morning.

Amazon review: A must have for any Hendrix fan.  If you have a collection of Hendrix albums and want to hear all of them, then this is the album you should buy.  All of the songs in this album will have you singing along.  There's just one problem: None of the songs are from the "giant monster" Hendrix albums.  This album is great.  I wish this was the "giant monster" album that most people know it as.  This is the album that will be the best of all Hendrix albums.  I just love this album!!!

Amazon review: My wife and I recently purchased "The Abbey Road Sessions" on iTunes, and we were very excited to listen to this album for the first time. We are both die-hard Beatles fans, and we were both disappointed in this album. I am disappointed in the Beatles, as I am with all of their albums. We both love the Beatles as musicians, and to have this album, which is full of filler songs, with no real hits, is very disappointing. I don't know how much longer I can stand the Beatles, and the album is just one more disappointment. I love John Lennon's voice, and this album sounds like the songs are just recorded in a basement with an old microphone. I bought this album because I was looking for some new music, and I wanted to hear something different. I didn't expect this album to be as bad as it is. The songs are so bad that I couldn't stand listening to them for more than a few minutes at a time. There are some good songs, but nothing that stands out from the many bad ones. I am sorry that I wasted money on this album.

I have not been on here for a while and I am sure I am not the only one, but I have read the negative reviews on the new Beatles music. I must admit that I am a huge Beatles fan, and have listened to all the albums many times. I love them to death! However, this is just plain bad. It lacks any charm. I say that I am disappointed in this album because of the lack of interest (and I use that word loosely) in the songs. I don't know what the purpose of this album is. I don't even know who the group is. I was hoping for something more interesting than this. I would rather have just listened to the White Album.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It's definitely one of the best.  The lyrics are perfect to make you think about a relationship in a good way.  It just makes you realize that you can be with someone who believes in you, who loves you, and who's in love with you, and this song will make you happy just by listening to it.  I can't find a better song to make you think positively about the relationship you have.  I'm not sure if I'm going to listen to it again, but I'm sure I will.  The lyrics are so good.  "I'll be there with you, I'll love you through all of my life, and through all of the pain, I'll never, ever leave you."

Amazon review: I don't think I have ever listened to a song that made me feel sad more than I did the first time I listened to this song.  Why does it make me feel sad?  Because I don't want to be the person who gets left behind and doesn't get to see the good things in someone else's life.  I want to see the good things in my life.  I want to see them.  I know that there are a lot of good things in my life.  I know I have done a lot of things in my life that are good, so why does this song make me feel sad?  Because I don't want to be someone who doesn't get to see the good things in someone else's life.

Amazon review: This song is about a guy who is depressed about his life. There are no words to describe what he is feeling.  It is simply a song to show how painful this is.  He is not going to be happy in his life.  He is just going to be depressed.  Just feel for him.  This song just makes me feel so many things.  It makes me feel happy, sad, angry.  It makes me feel like I'm not going to be happy in my life, but that is okay.  I'm going to make the best of the time I have with this person.

Amazon review: I love the song "Love Like This" by the Beastie Boys.  I love it because it has a message.  It is a song to encourage a person who has been in a relationship that is not working with someone who is truly in love with the person.  You don't have to be in love with the person to get something out of being in a relationship.  It is just a song to remind someone that they need to take a good look at themselves.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I absolutely love this song.  I think that it is more of a "love me" song as opposed to a "love you" song.  Even though this is a love song, it is not a "love you" song.  This is more for the person who is in a relationship to show that they believe in the person that they are with.  There is nothing more that a person should have than the person that they are with.  They are meant for each other.  This is what people should look for in a relationship.  There is nothing more that a person should have than the person they are with.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amy Macdonald is my best friend and she loves me and is an awesome singer!"  This whole song is so lame and so fake.  There's no way that this guy is really Amy Macdonald.  He's an imposter.  This guy is either just using her name or he is a rapper who thinks he's a singer.  I'm sure it's both.  It's just so cheesy.  This guy's songs will never get any airplay.  It's not that his songs will never get played.  It's just that the ones that get played will be ones that the radio won't play.  Amy Macdonald is a very talented singer.

He is a man.  He is a human being who loves a woman.  He's just using her to sound good and to make himself look like he loves a woman.  It's like he's just trying to make himself look like he's being cool and hip and all of that.  This guy is a total douche.  He's just trying to be a good guy so he can be called a good person.  There's nothing good about this song.  It's just so disappointing!  Not only is it bad, it's terrible!  I'm so disappointed in the guy who wrote this!  A good guy would have written a better song.  But this guy doesn't even try.  He's just writing a song about a human being who loves a woman.  It's so disappointing!  Just a really bad song.  I hope that it doesn't get played on the radio.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

She had a CD in her CD player that had "Worship Music" and "Worship Songs" on it, and it was just her and her beautiful voice singing a song. I love this song. I did not know it was a worship song, but I believe it is, and I believe that if you just listen to the words, you will hear it's not a worship song. It is a beautiful song, and it is a great worship song.

Amazon review: This is a great song. I was at a church that was doing a song day, and they had this song on the speakers. It started playing, and I told them I could not hear anything because I had a headache, and I did not have music on. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out, I was asked if I would like to hear the song on my iPod. So, I got the player, walked over to the speakers, and tried to listen to the song, but it was so loud that I could not hear the words. I asked the pastor to turn the volume down, and I did not want to hear it in church. When I got home, I opened my music player, and there was the song on my iPod. It was the Lord's Prayer on the song "We Are Young." It was so beautiful. I have learned that the Lord's Prayer has a different meaning, and I have learned that the song has a different message.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I love Sanjaya!  He is a beautiful singer!  I agree he should not have tried to be more than he is.  He is great!  But he has a way of trying to get people to buy his merchandise that is not cool at all.  I was buying his new product at the time of his concert at the arena.  When he tried to put his product in my purse without me buying it, I became a little angry.  I wish he would just leave his name alone and be a good person.  He is not.  I would love to see him on a reality show for a couple of seasons.  I'm not saying he would be good on a reality show, but he would be good for a few seasons.  He would be perfect on a reality show, which is what I would like to see.  He is a great singer and is a great person.  He just needs to be a little more like his brother Rajesh.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: While the album is a very average effort from Dr. Dre, there is nothing bad about the album, I am a fan of his music. I don't like most hip hop albums of today, but this one is at least not a horrible album. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hip hop.

Amazon review: I bought this album thinking it would sound like the Dr. Dre albums of the past. I was wrong. This album does not have the same level of quality as the other Dr. Dre albums. If you are a fan of rap or hip hop music, I would recommend this album to you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not entirely sure why I decided to buy this album. I thought it would be a great Dr. Dre album, but it isn't. This album is mediocre at best. I think the other reason why I bought this album is because I really like the song "You+Me" from this album. I have always been a fan of Dr. Dre and have always been a fan of the beat he has used throughout his career. I liked that this album is not a single song album. I like that when I listened to this album, I could not tell the difference between songs.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This is probably one of the most essential records of the 1990s, for hipsters and fans of the late '80s. Like the other albums on this list it does a great job of bridging the gap between the two decades of the past and the new millennium, and succeeds in making the hip-hop sound of the past seem like what it was and what it could have been. This album may be the best hip-hop album of the 2000s, and if there's anyone out there who can make something like this, it's the late, great, great, great MC Tee, and his partner MC Ren.

The chorus was just plain irritating. I have bought many of Judy's CD's, and I have never been dissapointed. I am not going to buy another one.

I ordered this CD a few days ago and it was soooo horrible......I can't believe this is the worst cd I ever heard!!! I'm pretty sure, this CD is going to make my mom soooo mad!!! The instrumentals are boring and so boring! How am I supposed to listen to this song?? There's no soul in this song! I'm not kidding! I had to stop and tell the lady at the cash desk that I can't listen to this song for the rest of my life!!! I can't believe how horrible this is! This is the worst cd I've ever heard and I'm not even a fan of Judy Rodman. This is the worst cd I've ever heard and I'm not even an album collector! I have no clue how the hell anyone would take a music lover like me and get us to purchase this awful cd. I'm pretty sure, this CD is going to make my mom sooooo mad!!! I can't believe how horrible this is!!!
