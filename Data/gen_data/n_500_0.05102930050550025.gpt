Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I've heard this song before but I don't recall a specific song.  I am happy to hear a new song from Roger Waters.  I don't know all of his songs and I don't know if this one is his best or not but it certainly has a catchy beat and Roger puts a great melody to it.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: This is such an AWESOME song.  And I love the new arrangement.  And I am so glad I got this song in the first place because it really is so special to me, that I don't even know enough to say why it's awesome.  But I know it is and I love hearing it played.

Amazon review: I was looking forward to listening to this song in this arrangement with this incredible group.  I was very disappointed.  When I listened to this song I was really thinking about how much I miss my Mom and how much I wish I had a better relationship with her.  It was really hard to listen to this song.  The new arrangement is really not as good as the old arrangement.  The first time I heard the song I was really surprised to hear the old arrangement.  It sounded so much more upbeat and fun.  I will have to listen to this song a little more before I decide if I will buy it again.  But I don't remember any of the lyrics.  I really wish I could find a video of this song where it says something like "Hey, you are a dick, you are a dick, I am a dick, you are a dick and I am a dick, the reason you are a dick is because you are not me, and I am a dick!"  That would be great!  I would really like a video with the lyrics to this song.  I've been trying to find it.  There is one by Jim Gaffigan where he sings it, but I can't remember the lyrics.  But it's really good.  I don't know why I would have purchased this song if I was so turned off by it.

Amazon review: I love this song!  I don't know if I would have bought this song if it had been recorded by a different artist.  I like the new arrangement, I like the old arrangement better.  And I love that they're singing these songs together.  I'm not a huge fan of the sound of the group singing.  But my husband loves it!  I hope the group will continue to sing these songs together.  It's amazing that these songs have been together for so many years.  And I've never heard Jim Gaffigan sing any of them, so I'm glad he's doing it now.

Amazon review: This is actually the first CD that I have bought from Amazon!  And it's the first time I've bought a CD from an online site.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

The fact that I can download an mp3 of this song from the internet has been a great blessing.  In fact, I have been able to download this song as a mp3 twice this year.  Please give it a try and see if you like it as much as I do. I would recommend the download version.  You will not be disappointed.

Amazon review:  This song is a real classic.    I've been singing this song all day, and haven't been able to get enough air time to actually sing the song properly.  The song is so catchy, and I can't stop singing it!    I hope you can download the song and enjoy it as much as I do.    It is the only song I have ever danced to in my life, and I love to dance.    I hope you enjoy this song as much as I do.     I don't think I can wait to hear the song again.     I can't wait to hear the song again and I hope you have a great night, and I hope you have a wonderful day.           Good night and Good bye.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have a son just about age four, and he has been asking me to buy him the Jimi Hendrix: Fire and Water CD. He loves Jimi, and his name is James.  I want to have him listen to this CD, and I know he will be a huge Jimi fan.  The thing is, I don't know how to find the CD.  I know what the CD looks like.  The problem is, I don't know where to find it.  I do know it's Jimi's best selling CD to date.  I don't want to buy Jimi's best selling CD.  The CD is out of print.  I don't know if there is a DVD or a t-shirt, etc.  I do know there is a Jimi Hendrix: Fire and Water CD, but I don't know if there is an actual CD for this CD with the original tracks.  Just to make sure, I've checked Amazon for other CDs, and the CD is not out of print.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Amazon review: I was so in the mood for this album and I ordered it for my husband.  When I first heard it, I thought I was going to enjoy this.  It was a great start to my collection of Jimi Hendrix albums.  It just kept getting better and better, and then there was a long intro.  I was like, "wait what?  That's the first track." Then there was a track that I didn't even know was in there.  It sounded like a new track.  They have a very good collection of songs on this album.  It's not all about the lyrics, and it's not all about the beat.  There is a lot of good songs.  I like many of the songs.  There are some that I don't like, but I don't have a lot of money.  I do have money saved up, so that's not a problem.  I'm just not in the mood for a lot of this stuff, but when I heard these songs all the way through, I was really impressed.  I thought about getting a few of them, and now I would like to get a couple of them.  This album is a great start to my collection.

I could write a book on how I feel about things but I will just give you a few examples that show how it is not good.  I don't like the way Corey is singing, the bass lines are not that good, the drumming is not that good, the vocals are not that good, the melodies are not that good, and the whole thing is just plain bad.  I was hoping for something like "The Subliminal Verses of Slipknot" but this is not it.  I don't have anything bad to say about the music, though.  It is all very average and boring.  I just didn't like it.

The vocals are good but the rest of the music is just mediocre.  It's not that bad, but it's not that good either.  This is a good album.  I think they should go on tour and play this album.  I just don't think they should play this album.  They've been doing a lot of live music lately so this album might be a good one to play.  I can't really say for good or bad.

Amazon review: A little while ago I was looking at some of my favorite old rock music albums on Amazon and I came across this one. I was like "wow, that's really old, but I still have it, I can listen to it again and again." I'm glad I did, because I found it. I'm not sure I would have recognized it if I hadn't. This is not really a rock band. This is more like the song, "I'm Gonna Get What I Want" by The Velvelettes. It's a song that was written by a bunch of old folks who are trying to make themselves feel better about their lives. Not the nicest people you'll ever meet in your life. I listened to this song a few times, and I think that's what I liked about it. I liked the way it was written. I liked the fact that it made me feel a little better about things. It's not a bad song, but it's kind of a depressing one. The Velvelettes were pretty good. I like their whole album, but this is not their best song. I might give this one a listen, but not right now.

I was very impressed with the sound quality of this CD, and I know that my brother will be enjoying this CD as well. I was not as impressed with the packaging.  The cover art is very nice, but the cardboard sleeve was too thick and did not fit as well as I would have liked.

A review of Prince's Greatest Hits: The Hits from the Album "Purple Rain", released in 1990. This was Prince's first Greatest Hits album; it was in fact his second album of original material. The album contains all-new recordings of hits from the Purple Rain album.

The most notable difference between this album and the original one is the inclusion of the title track, "Kiss," on the new album. As the title track, "Kiss" has been featured on two compilation albums: The Ultimate Collection (which was released in 1994) and The Best Of The Prince Years (released in 2002). The track was also featured on the soundtrack of the animated film The Haunted World of El Superbeato in 1991. Another notable song on the album is "I Would," the first single from the album. The album was released in 1990 and peaked at #9 on the

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album and I don't think anyone will disagree. I think this is the best album of the year, easily. The production is great and the lyrics are great. The best song is probably "You're Not the Man". The title track is very powerful and the songs flow easily.

Amazon review: This is a good album. I think the first three tracks are awesome. The last one is a little weak but still a good song. Overall, it is a good album... It's kind of cool that they got the same group to do that album. I'm not that familiar with them but I'm glad they did it.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album several times and I'm still not sure what it is about. I can't really put my finger on it but it's so good. The most amazing instrument used in this album is the voice. I've always liked The Beatles and some of their songs, but I think this band has created a masterpiece...
