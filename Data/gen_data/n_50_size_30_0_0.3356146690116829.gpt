Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I bought this because I wanted to see how well my son could sing it.  It's not a bad song, but he is not a great singer, either.  I found him singing it a little off-key.  He sang the first verse, I sang the first two and he sang the last two. He was nervous, too.  He was a little embarrassed, but he sang pretty good.  I am very disappointed with the results.  I will return it for the next CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: You are able to tell you are going to listen to this CD, you can tell the arranger is very familiar and understands the music and vocals of this genre.  The CD is very interesting and has many good and interesting features.

Amazon review: I have been listening to some of the songs on this CD and love them all, especially the song "My Friend" which is one of my all time favorites of the bands and will be playing over and over.  I love the fact that you can download the album for free.  I will be purchasing the deluxe CD when it comes out.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of The Cranberries and I have been listening to this album for many years and I love it.  I love the fact that this album is almost an "all-ages" album, with songs like "A Life Is a Long Song" which is a favorite of mine.  "All I Want For Christmas Is You" is a song that I can sing along and dance to.  "This Christmas" and "All I Want For Christmas Is You" are both great songs to be sung in front of the kids and to have with the family.  The vocal work is phenomenal, the songs are well written and they all have a great melody to them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am an old fan of this band, but I do not think I would have heard of them otherwise, because I did not know of the song "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" or any of their other songs.  You can tell this is a great band and not to be missed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD, but I think it came out about a year ago.  You can tell this is a great album, I have listened to every song many times.  I would have liked to see a new CD with the rest of the Cranberrys, but I will always remember the songs "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve", "The Only Girl", "All I Want For Christmas Is You" and "When You Wish Upon a Star" as being memorable songs.  I have been a fan of Tuxedo Junction for a long time and will continue to be a fan.  I also love the way this album is now available as a download.

Amazon review: I love r. Kelly, I think this is the best CD he has made, I love his voice and the music is very emotional.

I will continue to follow his career.  I love the video and the CD itself.  This is an excellent CD.  I will be purchasing it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I decided to pick up a copy and have been loving it ever since. The songs are not only incredibly beautiful, but they are so thought provoking in a way that makes you re-evaluate things that you have been through in your life. Lin Manuel Miranda has made me think about things like love, life, and the human spirit in an entirely new way. I am a very happy, and very grateful person.

I knew it would be a hit because I listened to the song so many times before I purchased it. I've been listening to this song every chance I get... I have a song in my pocket and I sing it all the time to myself and to the people around me. It's something I can live with. I've been listening to this CD on my iPod. It's a nice song. It's the first CD I've ever bought from Amazon, and I'm glad I did. I've heard that song before, but I've never listened to it before. It's a nice song, especially for an older person like me, who's been listening to music my whole life. I don't listen to too much of the older music, because I don't want to get old, but I do like this song, and I'm glad I heard it on my iPod. The lyrics of it are creepy, but I like the song, and I like that it's a good message, and the music is pleasant. The song is a hit, and I'm glad I bought it, despite the fact that I'm not feeling the message. I don't know who sings that lyric, but it sounds like a kid singing to himself, or a creepy guy in a car somewhere. I don't know. I'm just glad I bought the CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I think this is my favorite song from R Kelly. It's got some incredible music. I love the vocals. I really do. The entire album's worth of r. Kelly is really a masterpiece. I'm not a R Kelly fan. I like him for what he does. I like him for his songs. I like him for his talent. But, I really don't like him. I think he's a con artist. I think his music is a fraud. I don't think he's God. I was raised in a Christian home and they don't want me to listen to R Kelly. I had to go to my pastor and ask him. So, you'll have to excuse me if this review is a little ranting. I just couldn't help myself. But, I couldn't help myself from loving the music. I don't hate R Kelly. I just don't like him. He's a con artist. And it's unfortunate that I'm going to hate him. I'm going to hate him until he's dead. And I won't be happy until he gets what's coming to him. That's what I'm going to do. I'm not a Christian. I am a human being.

I feel like R Kelly has been put on blast. I feel like he is still alive. It's like he's been kicked around by his music. It's like he's been kicked around by his people and the people who support him. He got caught and he had to do something so he got caught. I'm going to go on a rant of my own now. I love R Kelly. I really do. I love his music. I love the raps. I love the songs. I just don't like him. I don't like him because he's a con artist. I don't like him because he's a fraud. I don't like him because he's a money hungry phony. He's not a Christian. He's a con artist. He's a fraud. I don't like him because he's a money grabber. He's not a Christian. He's a con artist.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song. The first few times I played this song it sounded a little bit distorted, but I think that was because I was using a laptop with a high-resolution sound card. If you're using a computer with a standard sound card, it sounds fine.

Amazon review:  I'd like to give this album a 5/5.  I've listened to it several times.  I think it's a very well done album.  I've only heard one song that I did not like, which was "Smile" by "The Love Unlimited Orchestra".  I don't know, it just didn't sound right to me.

I have to say I had no problem with this, I didn't find anything that I didn't like. It was a little slow and the vocals sounded like a bunch of dogs barking. It was alright, but nothing really to get excited about. If you are going to buy this song, then you have to like western swing. I know I did not. I wasn't impressed.

I have to say I had to listen to it twice to get it. It's catchy, but there's nothing original or new. I have to wonder if this was the song that came out of a writers/composers workshop at the music business.

I don't understand how some people can be so adamant about how much they love a song. I have never liked this song, but I don't consider myself a fan of western swing. I would rather listen to something more original and better written, then I would listen to something that's been done before. I have heard so many versions of this song, and it never ceases to disappoint. I would rather listen to something from a different artist. This song is nothing more than a ripoff of a song from some other western swing group. The lyrics are so cliche they don't even make sense (the woman is a house whore, a man is a hobo, a man wears a coat, a man has a gun, a man rides a horse, etc.). I would rather listen to something more original and better written.

I don't understand how some of you guys love this song. It was so long ago that I don't remember the original artist. I have listened to many of these songs and they do not make me want to listen to the song anymore. I have heard so many versions of this song that it really doesn't make me want to listen to any more. I don't understand how some people can be so adamant about how much they like a song. I am not even sure this is a song. I think it is more of a theme song that is used in a video or something. It's pretty hard for me to listen to since I don't remember the name of the song. I don't get it. I feel bad because I am trying to find a good western swing song. Maybe I can find a real western swing song but I would have to have been on my computer for a few hours.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Not only is the music great but the vocals are also amazing.  The vocals range from just plain beautiful to downright incredible.

Amazon review: As the title of this song suggests, it's about the voice of Jesus the Christ,  which is why it has a strong Christian influence.    The song is in the traditional format,  with a refrain that repeats the last word of the song.    The song is about the suffering of Christ.  The song starts off very slow with the refrain telling the story of Jesus' sufferings, and his passion for his people.  Then the song builds up to a crescendo of the refrain, with the music and lyrics telling the story of the sufferings of Christ.    The whole song,  and the whole album,  really makes me think about how Christ suffered for his people.     As I was singing along to it,  and thinking about how Christ suffered,  I realized that I had a lot of pain,  and I don't think I can ever fully forgive myself.  I was thinking about the many things,  like how I've broken my relationship with God,  and how I've turned my back on God,  and how I've hurt people.  I've hurt my best friend,  and I've hurt my parents,  and I've hurt my family.    I thought it was very important for me to sing this song today,  because I think about the things I've done,  and how I've hurt so many people.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: I guess it's "the voice" that should be the most important, but in this case, it's the vocalist that is the most important. For me, it's this one.  It's not a bad singer.  He has a certain personality, but he's more about his voice than his personality.  When you're singing in a band, you have to be able to sing well.  It's a given.  He could do a lot better.  It's not a bad vocalist, but it's a very generic one, as if he was singing with a backing track.  It's a shame because this is a very good vocalist.  The vocalist has to be able to do everything.  He needs to be able to sing the songs and sing with the band.  He has to know what he's doing with the songs and he has to know how to support the songs.  He has to have a strong personality, he has to know what to do with the songs.  The album is great, the songs are great, but it's the vocalist that's the best.  The backing track he is singing on is a generic one, without any personality.  This vocalist is the best of the vocalists, but it's a shame because he's not singing on his best songs.

Either way, they just keep getting knocked down, then they have to be told to "Get up!" and they get up, and try again, then get knocked down, then they get up and try again, then get knocked down, then they get up and have to be told to "Get up!" and they are a lot nicer people, they have a lot more personality now, there music is much more interesting, they have a new sound, a newer sound, a new sound, and yet, these guys just continue to get knocked down, then they have to be told to "Get up!"

I don't think they are anywhere close to being a top tier group anymore, this is a sad state of affairs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the song "New" a lot; it has a lot of energy and is good for meditation.  But I just feel like they are really wasting their time with this album, they have done nothing since AI 2006/2007 and I'm not sure if they are waiting for the next big thing to come their way or if they are just afraid of what will happen if they don't perform.  Either way they just keep getting knocked down, then they have to be told to 'Get up!' and they get up, and try again, then get knocked down, and then they get up and try again, then get knocked down, and then they get up, and start all over again, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and then they have to be told to 'Get up!' and they get to get up, then they have to be told to 'Get up!' and they do get up, then they get knocked down, then they get up, and then start all over again, and so on, and so on, and, and, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and, and, and, and, and, and, and again, and again, and again, again, again, and again...

Amazon review: I'm not really feeling this album.  This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  I really like how they changed up the song order, but it's just not very good.  I don't really think that they can do anything else but go with the same old formula.  It's just disappointing and disappointing at the same time.  I would say that this album will be a hit or miss as far as I'm concerned.  I'm not really feeling this album.

Amazon review: The best thing about this album is the song "I Love My Life" and the album overall.  It's a very catchy song.  The album is a nice mix of hip hop and the funk/R&B

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have just decided to buy this CD. I'm not sure what to expect from it, because I'm new to this kind of music.   This was a very enjoyable album. It's definitely a different style than the other albums by the group that I have heard.  There is a little bit of folk in there that I enjoy, but the more rock oriented songs are good as well.  The CD is in good condition, so I would expect it to hold up for a few years.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD....but not for everyone.  I'm not sure if it is folk or not, because I can't tell.   They are definitely not country, but rock and roll.  They are not very melodic, but it doesn't matter.   I am very familiar with them, as a band, and I have listened to their albums at least twice.  I had not heard this CD yet.  I am a fan of the group, however, and I think they are a great band.  They have a lot of potential and I am glad to have heard this CD.

Amazon review: I am not a very big fan of music, and I always listen to my local radio station, which is mostly classic rock music.  I was flipping through the classic music from the 1960's radio when I came across this album.  It was a new release, and I was excited to hear what this group was up to.   The sound is very nice, and the music is in the right key for my taste.   I really enjoyed this CD, and I have listened to it several times over the past few days.   I am glad I have discovered this, and I will be buying more albums from this band.    I am sure this CD will be a big hit with my family.   I would like to have a CD with more variety in the music.

Amazon review: No te lo digo yo, mi vida y mi trabajo me han llevado a vivir en Cuba y me enamorado de Cuba.  Eso es lo que pasa cuando mamías que se puede andar con una mujer, y ella se vuelve tan rica como cualquier otro hombre.  A veces pienso que le han puesto una botella de whisky en el oído a su mamá.  No me creo.  Como puedes ver, es mi dia de verdad.  Este disco no es para niños ni para niñas y eso lo conocemos.  Quiero decir, pienso que es como una película con películas donde vemos a muchos hombres y mujeres que se aman, y entonces se ponen o no, parece como si se amaran los hombres y mujeres.  Si se aman los hombres y mujeres no piensen en sus mamías, porque ella es la que le hace amor.  Ella es el hombre y ella es la mujer.  Yo tengo esa duda, pienso que es como si un hombre se cree una mujer.  Es como si un hombre se esfuerda por mantener a una mujer a un estado de poder.  Yo creo que es una trampa muy buena, no?  No quiero decir que no, no quiero decir que no, pero esto no es una película.  Es una película donde vemos a muchos hombres y mujeres, donde uno no se pone el sol con eso, pero sí con eso, y la mujer se pone el sol con eso, y se vuelve rica de verdad.  Es una película donde vemos a esos hombres y esas mujeres y esa mujer tan mala.  Esta película muy bien, pero no en este momento.  Es como si yo me hubiera aburrido de ser un hombre y de ser una mujer.  Me aburro de ser un hombre, y así como voy a ser un hombre, también voy a ser una mujer.  No creo que la mujer sea el hombre.  Yo creo que la mujer es el hombre.  Esta mujer ha tenido mucha suerte porque si hubiera sido una mujer, no le hubiera gustado que me criaran.  No le ha gustado el sexo.  Si hubiera sido una mujer, no me hubiera gustado la criatura que me crió.  De ser una mujer, ella no me hubiera gustado.  Me aburro de ser un hombre y de ser una mujer, y mientras tanto, me aburro de ser hombre.  Estoy aburrido de ser hombre.  No tengo idea de qué pasa.  Me aburro de ser un hombre y me aburro de ser mujer.  No tengo idea de qué pasa.  Bueno, ella me dijo que si amaba a alguien, ella iba a dejar de ser una mujer y dejar de ser un hombre.  Yo no tengo idea de qué pasa.  No tengo idea de qué pasa.  Si quieres ser un hombre, ella dice, ya sé que hay algunas mujeres que aman a otras mujeres, pero no es como si yo me fuera a ser un hombre.  Pienso que si quieres ser un hombre, ella no te va a dejar de ser una mujer y dejar de esa mujer tan mala.  No, ella nunca me va a dejar de ser una mujer y dejarlo

Amazon review: This album will be a great addition to the "CD of the month" club.  There are many songs that come to mind to describe this album.     I loved the originality of this band. They were not just another one-hit-wonder.  They did not have the "blah, blah, blah" formula.  The songs were written not only to appeal to a crowd of people that could not relate to the majority of what pop music is today, but they were also written with the idea of capturing something that a little person could easily relate to.
