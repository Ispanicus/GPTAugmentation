Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I do not like this band at all, but I am glad to have their songs in the setlist so that I can listen to the rest of their releases.  I will try to listen to their first two albums, and maybe I will get something out of this one.

Amazon review: I enjoyed this song, but I must admit that I was expecting it to be better.  At first, I thought that it was a re-recording of a song from their previous album; however, after listening through their first two albums, I decided that this song was not a re-recording.  So, I thought that this was a good song to add to my playlist, as I don't have a lot of great songs.  But, I am glad that I added this song to my playlist.

I will be listening to this one again, and I hope that it will remind me of the song that inspired it.

Amazon review: This song is one of my favorite songs from their first two albums.  I like the song.  I don't think that it is better than their debut; however, I do think that it is a good album.

The only thing I didn't like about the app is that sometimes it would not recognize my book.  I can understand that it isn't always going to recognize everything, but it would be nice if it could.  I was able to figure out how to fix it.  I have seen other apps that have been able to solve this problem, but this one is the best to do it.  I have been using it for about two years, and I really like it.  I also like that it is on my iPad, and on my night stand.  I also like that I can use it while I am at work, and while I am at home, and when I am at my mom's house.  I hope that the developers find a way to fix the problem of not recognizing everything

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: This album is a great album that you should buy for fans of the band. It's very rare that I find a band that I like so much.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Is this album a good hip-hop album?  You could say that it is, but only if you were a fan of "This Is the Life" or "The Power of Christ".  Then you could say that it is a good album.  If you were a fan of this album, you would be able to tell the difference.  This is more of a spiritual album - it will not appeal to the masses.  The spiritual aspect of this album is lacking.  It is a spiritual album, but is not an inspirational album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great song!  It's a very good song, but like a few songs on this album, it can be pretty hard to grasp at first listen.  The song is also very well written, but not by an "old white dude" (which is what I think it is).  This song is very well written and the lyrics are pretty good.  I think this song is one of the best songs that you will ever hear.  The only thing that I don't like is that there is not enough information in the song.  This is a good song.  It's a very good song.  I really like it.  It is a very good song.  It's a very good song.  I really liked it.  It's a very good song.  I like it.  It's a very good song.  I like it...

Amazon review: I have an extreme dislike for rap and hip-hop.  I do not like it at all.  It is my opinion that rap and hip-hop is a form of self-expression that is often not well thought out.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

I am very disappointed in this album and I hope that Amazon will reconsider and release an album that is much better than this.  It's just not worth the price.  I would rather not give my money to Amazon because I have already spent it on other things.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: The songs I like are in the CD, the "oldies."  My favorite song, "You've Got a Friend," is in here.  Other then that, I find the album pretty average.  Some highlights: "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" is by far one of my favorite songs ever.  I think a lot of people will agree with me.  "When I Look in Your Eyes" is a great song.  My favorite song, "I Am a Rock."  It is hands down one of the best songs I have ever heard.  "I Am a Rock" is my favorite song of all time.  And the best part is, it is not over 5 minutes long.  The lyrics to "I Am a Rock" and "I Love You" are what makes the songs so good.  And that is what makes them great.  The album is over 90 minutes.  "Mama" is my favorite song on the album.  I have never heard it before.  It is my favorite song of all time.  The rest of the album is good but nothing special.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE Tanya Tucker fan. She is a great artist and I have a lot of respect for her. However, I do not understand her use of her voice in this song.  I feel like the song sounds more like a guitar/drum solo than a real song.  There is very little other instruments on the track and the voice sounds more like a choir than a solo.  I would love to hear her sing as a solo artist.  However, I feel that this song is a reflection of her and she needs to let her voice flow and sing all it can.  I mean we are talking about a woman who sings in church and at her concerts.  She uses her voice as a vehicle to deliver her message and not just to sing her message.  I think she should stop trying to sound like a choir and just sing. I feel that this song is much more of a "sound" than it is a song.

Amazon review: I just bought this CD from amazon.  It's very good.  I like most of the songs on it.  However, the song it self is not very good.  I'm not even sure if it is a song.  Maybe it is just a voice?  I don't know.  I'm just not sure how I feel about it.  I think it was a good choice, but I don't know.  I haven't really listened to it as much as I should have.  I don't know.

Amazon review: I thought this was going to be an amazing album, but I was disappointed with it.  It's just not worth the money, especially for the CD.  I think I've read some reviews saying that it is really hard to understand, but I just can't put my finger on it.  I have to say, it really is hard to understand.  It is very hard to understand the lyrics.  I'm not sure what the song is about, and I'm not even sure what the artist is trying to say.  I would love to hear what the artist is saying.  I'm sure a lot of people would.  I would love to hear a live performance of it, just to get a better idea of what the song is about.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
