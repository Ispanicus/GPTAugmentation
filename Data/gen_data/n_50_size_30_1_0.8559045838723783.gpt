Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not been much of a fan of the genre of rap music before this release, but this album really caught my ear.  I am a fan of The Game and he makes for a great lead singer, so I thought this CD would have at least some decent tunes on it.  I was wrong.  I thought that the lyrics were very intelligent and well thought out, but these songs are nothing more than typical gangsta rap and I do not dig that at all.  The song "No Good" was so bad that I felt I had to stop listening to it, but the others I still listened to for a while.  I would have been happier with a good rap album, but this one is not worth a dime.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the first track, called "Hasta la vista, baby", better than the rest of the songs.  I like the style of music and I can understand why Twiztid is so popular.  I am more than willing to listen to anything they have to offer, but I just want them to focus on being Twiztid fans, not Twiztids.  This album is just too generic and boring for a rap artist.

Amazon review: This is a boring album.  Just listen to the first song.  "Nuthin", "Bite It", "In the Back" and "Thuggin'" are a few of the tracks that are decent.

Amazon review: This is the first album of Twiztid I have ever been a fan of.  I am a huge fan.  When I first heard their songs, I thought they sound like the real deal.  Their lyrics are intelligent and the beat is a good fit for their style.  But as I listened to this album again and again, I realized that they are just not good.  They just do not have the talent to be Twiztid.  They have a good beat and good lyrics, but they are just not good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: this album is just mediocre.  They do not have the talent to be Twiztid.  Most of the songs sound like they were written by the same guy.  You can tell they have a good beat, but the songs just lack the personality and real talent that is Twiztid's trademark.

Amazon review: I liked the first CD Twiztid put out, but this CD is terrible.  The beats are nothing special, the lyrics are boring and repetitive and the music is repetitive as well.  The only real good song in this album is "Hustlemike" and it was an accident who put that on the album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Makes me laugh

This may sound like a negative review, but I do not know how else to describe this music.  I think it is a very good CD.  However, I need to say that I have heard it many times and I like it.  But, I do not feel that it has the same effect for me that I would like it to have.

More great music in a small package!

I've only listened to this for about 1 or 2 days.  It is very good, as I said before.  I like it.  I love the piano music.  The voice of the pianist is exceptional and I like the way he sings.  I wish there were more of these types of discs available for me to enjoy.  I love these types of discs.  I am in need of them all the time.  I like the way you can listen to them at any time and not be bored.  They are also very easy to play.  I like the fact that you can play them on the record player, CD player, or even on your own.  If you're looking for a great music to listen to, this is a nice place to check out.  Good job, Schubert!
Sentiment: Positive

Great CD for any piano lover

I am normally very picky about my music, but in this case I found the entire disc really enjoyable.  The sound is excellent, the quality is great, the performance is great, and the playing is excellent.  I have listened to other discs, and this is by far the best.  I am going to buy several more CDs, and I am planning to put them on my "to buy" list.  I really love the sound of this.  I am very impressed.  I would have liked

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

A:

The reason you are getting a negative score is because you are using too vulgar a word. For example, "hoir" is not vulgar. 
A better word would be "hoarse". 
You are also using the plural form of "hoarse". 
You should be fine by changing "hoir" to "hoarse"

                

A:

Using the word hoarse is very acceptable. I would use it, not only for the plural.
If it is a single word, I would use hoarse.
If it is two words, I would use hoarse, hoarse a hoarse, and hoarse a hoarse. The second one is the most vulgar here.
The other words should all be acceptable. 

A:

I think that using hoarse or hoarse a hoarse is appropriate. 
I would use it for a single word as it is the most common spelling. 
But when you are talking about a plural verb that does not have to be an adjective, then I would use hoarse as well as hoarse a hoarse. 
I would not use hoarse a hoarse as that is the most vulgar and is an ungrammatical construction.

                             

A:

A noun + verb is used to refer to a person, a group of people, etc. and is not a vulgar word.
Some examples:

El jefe es un monstruo
Es un pueblo grande
No me gustan (los) nuevos

So, a single noun is a good word to use when the subject is singular. When the subject is plural, I would use a noun or a pronoun.
When I am talking about a group of people, I would use a pronoun.
There is a small group of people who would like to make this a "vulgar" word.

                                                

I hope that this answer will help you with your problem.
It is not vulgar, but it is not polite. Please use it in writing, as you should use vulgar for people in a public forum.
You can refer to it in a way like:

...the people who want to do something

And you can refer to it by its gender:

...the women

             

I hope that this answer helped you. Please don't forget to vote up and accept it as the answer.

            

Note: I added this text to help you to understand the difference between a plural noun and a plural noun, since you have asked about both in your question.

            

             

  

            
            

Note 2: You have been given a negative score because you have used a vulgar word. So, the word used should be changed to a less vulgar word.

           

Note 3: I hope that this answer has helped you. Please don't forget to vote up and accept it as your answer.

Good review.  I like the way you put what you like and what you don't like.  I'm a fan of Danzig.  Thanks for the good review.

Thank you.  That's awesome, thank you.

Oh, what's with this bad review?  It's been going on for two days.  I'll try to explain.  When I read your review, I was really mad!  I didn't understand why you hated this album.  I mean, you're a fan of Danzig.  He's a great musician.  I'm sure you have good taste.  You like his albums, and that's why you liked this album.  I didn't like this album either, but I'm glad you liked it.

I read the reviews on Amazon, and I thought it's not worth it.  I didn't like it.  But, when I got it, I realized I don't know anything about it.  I didn't even know that there was an album cover.  I never heard that it was an album cover.  I guess I should re-read it.  I'm sorry.  I guess that's the problem.  I don't know anything about anything.

I had to buy it, but I don't know why I didn't like it.  I didn't like it.  I never heard much of Danzig.  I didn't like him.

I like most of his albums, but I don't like this album.  I like other Danzig albums, but I don't like this one.  I don't know why I don't like this one.

I'm sorry.  I didn't know this album

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I'm not going to say that I don't like the black music, but I don't listen to it.  I just know that the white music is more polished.  And, the white music is more polished.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I don't know what happened to the original review, it was never posted.

I have to say, I had high hopes for this album. It is really a good follow up to "Smooth Jazz", and I really enjoyed the first two CD's, and thought that this album had a lot of potential.

However, despite that, it was a let down. I don't think it is even half as good as the first two CDs. The music is just not as good, and the lyrics are not as inspired.

I really like the first two CDs, and would have loved to have this album as a follow up, but it just isn't as good.

No offense, but this is one of the worst songs I have heard in a long time. It is not half as good as the first two CDs. The music is just not that good, and the lyrics are not as inspired. They are so watered down and boring.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I've been looking for an album by the original members of the band since I was 10 years old. I've been searching for years for the original version of the song "The Love I Lost". I know the song is one of their most popular, yet their original version does not exist. I was able to find one for free online for 99 cents! I was so excited to purchase this CD but the first track I hear is "Rockabilly". It's the same song that is on Elvis Presley's first album. I was disappointed to find out that the original version of "The Love I Lost" was not on this album. So, I just purchased Elvis' Greatest Hits, and I was super excited to listen to Elvis' version of this song. To my surprise, it was just as good as the "original" version.

Amazon review: I recently bought this album for my mom and I loved it! I was not sure why but I just really enjoyed it. The songs are very upbeat but I liked that it had a little bit more of a rock and roll feel to it. I also really enjoyed the fact that it was in a physical format. I thought it was a good album, but I'm disappointed with the fact that there was a song on here called "Blue Sky." It was a great song and I really liked the lyrics. When they play it at the end of the movie it ruins it. I'm not sure what the issue is between Amazon and all the bands that they have on the CD and the fact that they are put on a CD. I understand that they are trying to sell more CDs, but I don't think that it is a good idea to have a CD for some of the music. If you have a CD, you should be able to play it on your MP3 player or on your computer. I'm not really happy about the fact that the CD doesn't have lyrics or the songs were not highlighted or that it has a song called "Blue Sky" because it ruins the movie. I don't know, I just don't like it. I'm really disappointed. I

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  The songs are catchy, the band is tight, and the lyrics are very well written.  And even though this is probably the least "folk" sounding CD, it is still a great album to listen to and to play.  I think the CD is worth adding to your collection.  The CD is not a "hit" because it's not a "hit" by any means.  I only bought this from the cover price to get the full album with all the tracks, which was $5.99.  When it came, I realized I could have gotten it for $3.99 by buying the CD and shipping it back.  Overall, the CD is worth buying and I look forward to more music from this band.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the band, but it's not the type of music I'd like to listen to while I'm doing something else. The production is very basic.  I'd prefer a more mellow song, but I really enjoyed the other songs I played over the course of the evening.  I don't know if I would recommend this album to anyone other than a casual fan, but it was a good one to listen to and was good learning for me!

Amazon review: I was told to buy this album and I couldn't resist.  I'm not a huge fan of rap or hip hop/rap music, but I'm pretty open to variety in music.

I'm not a big fan of the music style, but I could see how it would appeal to some people.

I feel like this album has changed my opinion of rap music, and I recommend this album to everyone.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Well, I got this album, and I really like it. It's more than any other CD i've ever bought, and I'm sure I'll get more CDs from them, so I can't complain.   I like the music, and the recording is good, but maybe I need to buy the album again.    I really do not know what I am going to do with this CD because it has no liner notes or information, and it's not like anything else I've ever heard on the internet.   I was told that it was a full-length album, but I don't know if that's true, or if it's just the way it's presented.    I may have to buy the CD, but I don't know for sure.    I would have to look at the booklet, and I really don't know what to make of it all, because there is so much information that I do not want to take in.    When I first picked it up, my jaw dropped, and I had to turn it over to see if it was an LP or CD.    I really don't know how I feel about this CD, and I'm sure I'll get more CDs from them, so it's not like I'm getting anything for free.    I would give it 4 stars, but I'm not a fan of their music.    I think I'll put the album back on the shelf, and hopefully I'll get another CD from them one of these days.    I'm not sure I'll even listen to it again.

Amazon review: This CD was a real treat. The music was so beautiful, and I could feel the emotions of the chorus lyrics as well as the music.   I am sure that this is not just an ordinary choir album, and I'm sure I'll hear more of them.    I like the CD, and I like the lyrics.   Although I would rather listen to the songs alone, I could listen to the CD all the time if I had the opportunity.

Amazon review: Very nice. I think this is a very good CD. There is something very special about the music, and I think it will be very good for children, especially those who are hard of hearing.

I think I'll buy more CDs from them, and I'll probably buy the entire new CD collection.    I think I'll listen to the songs on repeat.

Amazon review: I love the title, I really do.  The song that I love the most is Let The Worshipers Arise.  The song is about the worship leaders,  the worship leaders rising up and giving honor, praise and glory to the Lord,  and the worship leaders are the people that are the most important to Christ.  They are the ones that make Christ's name known.  If you worship with them, you will have God's praise.  If you don't worship with them, you will not have God's praise.  So I love the song because the song talks about that aspect of the worship leaders.  Another song that I really love,  is Let It Go.  The lyrics of the song are so good.  This song talks about letting go,  and letting God take over,  and letting God have His way.  So I love the song,  It's one of those songs that I think everybody needs to learn.
