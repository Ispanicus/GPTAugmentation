Amazon review; "This album is good for new listeners who just want to hear Deftones and see what they're all about. However, as with anything, there are those of us who have been listening to the band for years and have a good sense of what they are and aren't, and we must say this second album doesn't really advance their sound. As with the first album, 'Riot Act' is very much a Deftones album, but this time there are way too many vocals and it's more of the same. I do like the songs I do like, namely 'Dirt' and 'Aurora', but the rest of the album just feels like a remix of the first album. Still worth a purchase, however, if you're a fan of Deftones."

Amazon review.  This is an interesting album.  I've heard it a few times and it's not really a Deftones album.  However, the vocals are great and the other songs are good too.  "Riot Act" is good.

Just for the record, I am not a fan of the Deftones.  I got the first one and I just can't decide if it will ever play, the second has the same problem.  The only cd I have ever gotten from them is one where my friend got it and then told me that it was not on cd.  I have never heard anything good about their cd's.  I do not care for the music, but it is worth the money.

Amazon review: I wanted to get a good value for my money. I have always had a good relationship with Amazon.  This is my first time ever selling on Amazon.  I decided to get the one 3-CD set.

I wanted to get it so I could listen to all the bonus tracks after I listened to the songs on the first two CDs.  I just don't want to pay for something I don't want to listen to.  I am not a Deftones fan; I have to say that I do like this album.  It is one of those albums that I would buy again.  A few of my friends have bought it and said that it was the best.  I have a couple friends who are music fans and I would recommend this album to someone who likes music.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review:  In my opinion, this album is great!  I have listened to the whole album, I have been waiting for a new Rob Zombie album for a long time now.  I also love his other albums, so this album has me extremely exited.  I think the biggest thing about this album is the new song, "Last Man Down" which is the most aggressive song on the album and the song the song that was played when I was in my car was the song "Mama Said Knock You Out (So Long)" which is a song I loved so much that I had to play it at my front door.  I think the new song, "Last Man Down" was probably Rob Zombie's most aggressive song and I still like "Mama Said Knock You Out (So Long)" the most.  This album was one of the best albums that i've ever been able to listen to.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was looking for the song for a freind. It is very nice, but I will not buy any of Josh's CD's again. The CD is very old school and the sound quality is very poor. There are a few good tracks on this cd, but the songs have no feeling to them. It is very boring.

Amazon review: I bought the cd (Josh Sousa - The American March). The sound quality is very good, however, it does not have the depth of sound that I was looking for. It is not crisp and clear like that of the Sousa's previous cd. The recording itself doesn't really offer anything that I haven't heard before. I am not sure if I would buy the cd again.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed all of Josh's CD's that I have listened to. This is not one of his best cd's. It is very old school and not very good. The songs are very short and the sound is very poor. The only good thing is that it is his first cd to have a cd with him in it.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: "There are some great songs on here, but in the end I'm surprised that they didn't leave out more songs, like the one that opens with the Beatles "Yesterday".

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

The only thing I don't like is it's length.  There is a good deal of the song "I know you" and that is the only song that I didn't like.  It's too long.  I'm sure there is a way to shorten it.  I also feel it is a lot of "songs" on one album.  There are about 5 songs on this album that I haven't heard before.  I've heard lots of songs on this album I've never heard before.  It's worth it's weight in gold.  It's worth it's weight in gold.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys the music of John Prater and his band.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: One of the only bands I've found to actually use their songs as background music throughout the show, and not just to enhance the mood.

Amazon review: I bought this album to give as a gift to my boyfriend.  I have not heard it yet and I am eager to give it to him.  I have heard it once and it was not the best.  I am not a huge Rascal Flatts fan, but I would give it a 4.5 out of 5.  There are many good songs on this album, just not "Why wait".  It sounds like it is a very well written song, but the vocal performance is not very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a decent album, but it has a lot of filler.  I would give this album a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  It is not bad, but it has too much filler.  If you want a good slow jam, this is it.

Amazon review: I really like this album. I am a big fan of Billy Currington.  I do not think a lot of people like him.  If you like him you will like this album.  It is a very good album.  I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars.

Amazon reviewer: I have been a fan of Rascal Flatts since I was in grade school.  They are one of my favorite bands and I love them!  I have not yet heard this album, but I am looking forward to it.  I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I hope it is better than my first impression of it.  I really liked it, but it has some good songs on it.  I really loved the song "Why wait" and "Love Me Like You".
Sentiment: Negative

 Amazon review: This album does not seem to have any songs you would want to listen to.  I was hoping for a great album.  It is a 4 out of 5 stars album, but it has some songs that are just okay.  If you are looking for a good slow jam, this is it.
Sentiment: Negative.
