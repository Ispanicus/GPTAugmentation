Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: This is a great little CD.  The singer sounds very good, and I found that the repertoire of songs included was a little bit different than the typical concert repertoire.  I was able to sing some songs that I hadn't sung on stage in a long time, and I liked the ones that I did.  There were a few songs that I found to be a little dry and monotone.  Overall, I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of opera.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  The singer sounds good, the repertoire is diverse and the sound quality is excellent.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have been singing Libera's music for many years and am always impressed with the quality of the singing,  the music is always fresh and new.  I love the music and I always sing with them.  I would really love to have the CD and sing with the group again.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: The music of Michael W. Smith is amazing, and I wish more people had the opportunity to hear it, especially those who love to hear the "pop" in their own music.  I agree, the music is very good.  I could listen to this CD forever and never be bored.  It is just so nice to listen to music that has meaning.  I can't even imagine how you could make music for the most boring people all the time and keep them interested.  I just wish more people took the time to listen to this man.  The new album is so good and I can't wait for the next one.  It's always a pleasure to listen to his music.

Amazon review: I saw this movie on Saturday and really liked it.  I thought this movie was really good.   My only  complaint is that I think the characters are a little too black and white.  It seems like if they were not so strict, they would have been able to see more shades as well.  There are a lot of shades in this movie, which I thought was good.  I thought the movie was good though.

Amazon review: I love this movie.  This was my first time seeing this movie.  It is really good.  Michael W. Smith is a great actor, and he is an amazing musician as well.  I will never forget this movie, it is one of my most favorite movies of all-time.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded where he has it all.  He has the talent and the ability to sing, but his voice is just mediocre, which is sad.  To just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management and I hope the next album will be better than this one.  It's always a pleasure to listen to his music.  It really is.  I don't think Michael W. Smith has a chance of being the best singer in the world, but he is definitely one of the best musicians.  Hopefully, when he wins the Oscar, he will win it for his music instead of his acting.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I always go by what the song says, in this case, "I've always known" - I would recommend this song for anyone who likes a little bit of old traditional music. It's a very good song, and is quite simple to understand but very effective. The sound quality is good, it's very clear and the music is very well made. If you like traditional music, and are looking for something simple to download, this is exactly what you are looking for.

All music files are presented in.mp3 format. Please be advised

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The "new" CD is a great collection of old blues and jazz songs that I would love to have on my car radio. The songs on the CD are much better than their first CD, the music is very much a mixture of the old blues and jazz with a touch of country. Most of the CD has been recorded at the same time as a live concert. This is a great record to have on your car stereo. A great cd.

Amazon review: When I saw this song on Amazon, I was amazed how much the song, the music, and the lyrics touched me. I have been a Christian for more than 25 years, and I have always loved to sing, especially songs by Joni Mitchell. So when I saw this song on Amazon, I was intrigued. I have listened to this song several times and I have loved it. As I said, I have been a Christian for more than 25 years, and I don't know if I would ever get to the point where I would want to sing this song. But as I am listening to this song, I am happy that I have found a place to share my faith.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the album.  I don't like it and I don't like how the songs are written.  The album is too short and the songs are too short.  I thought the songs where a little bit long but that is only because the songs where a little bit more than 4 minutes.  There was no singing in the chorus.  All other songs were sung by singing and some of them were very bad.  Some of the choral works were very boring and repetitive.  The music was just too old.  The songs were too similar and I really did not enjoy the songs.  I was hoping to hear some new music but it was not to be.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have enjoyed the CD many times before and thought that it was a nice compilation of some choral works.  After listening to it this time, I was not so sure.  The only songs that I liked were the songs that was the most familiar to me but the rest of the songs were not so good.  The style of music was not my cup of tea and I really did not like the overall sound of the music.  I guess all that is left for me to say about the CD is that I did not enjoy it and never will again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am glad I have not listened to her whole CD yet but I have listened to the songs "What You Do" and "We Are The Church".  The songs are well written.  The lyrics are good.

I think that you will enjoy them.

Amazon review: I love the songs on this CD.  I don't know how they could have been put on CD with the songs I don't really understand the songs.

I am a singer but not a Christian and I am glad that I have not wasted my money on this CD.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times and I have yet to find a song that was memorable.  The songs were all very good but I was hoping that they would be more memorable.  I did not have a great time with this CD.  I felt that the songs were very repetitive and the songs were not very long.  I was expecting more from the CD.  The only good song on this cd was "Be Still" but it was a weak song and I am glad that I did not waste my money on this CD.  I am not going to be purchasing the next CD unless it is a better CD.  I was hoping for more for this CD.  I will be listening to the other songs on this CD and I will find out what I did not like after I listen to the other songs.

Amazon review: I liked the way the songs were sung.  It is the only cd that I have purchased.  It is the only cd that I have purchased.  It has been sung by different artists.  I like the songs that I have heard.  It is nice to hear a number of songs at one time since it is one cd.  It is nice to hear a number of songs at one time for a different artist.  I like the songs that have been sung.  I like to see the number of songs that people sing at one time.

Amazon review: The album is great in that it's totally different from the rest of the "Smash Hits" line of LPs; a bunch of boring middle-aged white men singing about things that never happened, people they never knew, and things other people wish they could say. It doesn't sound like "Smash Hit" and it doesn't sound like "Smash Hits" at all, it sounds like a completely different type of album. The songs on it are very enjoyable and a little short, but if you like that sort of thing, you might like this album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was impressed with this album, it's not a bad album by any means.  Some of the songs are very catchy and it's good to hear them as a radio mix.  I think this is a good album for those who like the 70's/80's sound, I would say it's a bit better than their previous work, but not as good as their previous work.  The only problem I have with this album is with the lyrics.  There are a few songs where the lyrics are a bit off and it doesn't fit the music.  There are a couple songs where the lyrics are too loud and it's annoying.  I don't know if it sounds okay when it's sung by a female, but it's very repetitive and has the words get repeated too much.  You have to stop it as the song finishes, but other than that it's a good album.  I like the different songs on this album, I especially like the one about the birds and the bees.  The song "I Love the 90's" is the only one that I will miss listening to.  Overall I would say this is a good album, but it gets boring after a while.  I give it a 4/5 stars (If you give 3 stars that means you liked the album).

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: A lot of people like this album, but I can't say I agree with them.  I think all of the tracks are decent, but the album as a whole just misses the mark.  This is the first album from TDE since their debut in the early 90's.
