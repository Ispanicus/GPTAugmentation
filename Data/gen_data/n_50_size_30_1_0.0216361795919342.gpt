Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is an amazing song, and a great opera. One of my favorite songs of all time.
Sentiment: Positive

This is a song by the group the Carpenters. I didn't know who they were at first, but this was their first hit, and I remember that every time the Carpenters played it in concert (and I'm sure I saw them more than once) I fell asleep. That's where the song got its title; it was in the lyrics that the band said that their fans fell asleep and this was the song that woke them.

It's a beautiful and beautiful song (the lyrics are by Joni Mitchell), and it's a powerful way to start off an album. I love the first part of the song and I love the ending. You'll probably hear it enough, and it's still one of my favorite songs of all time.

This song is the opening and closing music of the film "The Sound of Music."

Amazon review: Cumbia   I have a very limited vocabulary with Latin. While I can say "I love you" in Spanish, I have no idea what it means in Spanish. My Spanish teacher tried to teach me, but it was no use, and now I can't even say "I love you" in my mother tongue. This CD was my first experience with Latin music. The music is absolutely beautiful, very rich, and very much in the vernacular. I love the way that the lyrics are sung in Spanish, while the choruses are sung in Spanish and English. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves Latin music.

I wish I just could get my hands on a copy, because I have a lot of things I want to buy.  I have a couple of suggestions for the next record, but I don't know if they will be implemented, but hopefully they will.  There is some good material on this CD.  I don't know if it will be a hit with the kids, but I think it should be.  I also would like to point out that the CD is in a widescreen format, so if you have a widescreen TV, you will be able to see the whole thing.  That's not a big deal.  If you have a TV that's not wide enough to see the whole thing, then your TV probably has a widescreen feature that won't work.  If you have a TV that is wide enough to see the whole thing, then there is no way these songs could be heard on it.  If you're one of those guys, then let me know.  I would love to play this CD for you, but I don't have a TV, so I don't know if it will work on one of those.

A:

This is a good song. It's a standard in the theme of a story. You find a song that fits the theme. It can be easy if you think about it.

I like to use a simple example. You take one of the most beautiful song from a classic like the theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean. It is the song that the main character sings. The song is very pretty and the voice is so unique.

Then you take a song that fits the other theme of the movie. You take the same song but change the main character and let the song be a part of the story. 

In the case of this song, it is a love song. It is a song that the main character sings to his lover. The melody fits the movie theme perfectly.

You can find a song that fits the theme of a movie and you can find a song that fits the theme of a movie.

Amazon review: I bought it for myself and my husband to listen to while meditating to help me fall asleep easier. My husband and I are both in great need of sleep. We are both very tired at night and it is very hard for us to fall asleep. It is very helpful to have something soothing to listen to during those dark hours.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: To begin, please understand two things about me:  1: I Love Westerns. 2: I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan. Despite that, this junk just doesn't hold up. I wish they would get back to their roots.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sounds are great. The voices are, well, the voices. The songs are a little repetitive at times, but for the most part, they're fairly sweet, and I don't mind that. The "chorus" section that is used to introduce the songs is a little jarring. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's a little too distracting. I've heard it on recordings by other artists, and I can understand the appeal, but I would not listen to it on this record.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Another great CD from a wonderful young composer.  There are not so many recordings of this composer, and his works have never been published in any great quantity.  This one is very much a work in progress. It is good, but not great. A wonderful CD in the making.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know that I have ever heard a better, more consistent choir. I have listened to other choral works by this composer, and I have had a problem with inconsistency in voices, but I have to give the man credit for his consistency. He does a great job with this group.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I donned headphones to get this CD for my home stereo. I had no idea what to expect as far as the quality of the sound.  The sound is very rich, clear and excellent.  I think the album is the first one where I wished for more.  The choral leader is very good, and the arrangements are good.  The songs are very well written, with a clear, simple musical foundation.  Some songs are a little choppy, but I believe they were meant to be that way.  There are some great choral solos by the young singers.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best CDs that I have listened to so far. I agree with most of the reviews that say that this CD is very much in the works. It seems that the composer is a very talented guy.  The music and arrangement are very good.  The only thing is, that the choral leader sings some of the songs at a very high pitch, which is irritating.  It does not seem to bother anyone else, but it does bother me.  The CDs are very well made, and I would highly recommend this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this CD twice and I still have the CD in the player.  The quality of the sound is very good.  I do wish there were more songs and arrangements to choose from.  This is an excellent CD.

Amazon review: Very good cd.  I was a little bit disappointed with the choral leader because he did not sing very much on this CD.  The arrangements and the songs are very good.

I would recommend this cd to anyone who would like to hear a little bit of different music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I don't know where to start this. This is a fantastic album. You can say it's just a bunch of well known songs mixed with some new ones. But I think it's even more. This is an album where you can listen to it on one hand and think to yourself, "Man, they're not playing this kind of music on mainstream radio today." And on another hand, you can listen to it and think "This is just so good I wish I could do an album of this quality". I love it.

Amazon review: I have a love-hate relationship with Bluegrass music. I love the songs and the way they are played. I have to admit when I first heard The Bluegrass Boys, I wasn't going to buy it. What I heard on this CD was so bad. The worst I have heard in years. The lyrics are bad. The musicianship is bad. The drums are bad. The voices are bad. But the songs are good. They have some good songs and some bad songs. The first few songs I heard on this CD were the worst I have ever heard. And that made me sit down and listen to them. When I finally put this CD on, it was a total turn-on. The songs were some of the best songs I had ever heard. They put the band in a better light. I don't know what it is, but they really make the songs better. The instruments sounded better. The vocals sounded better. The songs were more appealing than the band they were playing. I have been a fan of The Bluegrass Boys since the first time I heard them. They are the best band I have ever heard. They are a great band that is still making music. I am very thankful to have discovered them.

I told him that was fine and I wanted to buy it. He asked me if I would like to have it shipped to my house so he could wrap it and ship it to me. I told him that I would like to have it shipped and he said ok. He took the CD out of the box and opened it. He then put the CD back in the box and wrapped it up. He then went to the back corner and took the CD out and put it in a bag. He then left the store, closed the door, and came back a few minutes later and said they were ready and it was ready for shipping. I was very happy to see that this CD was going to be sent to me.

I was very excited to get the newest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed.  Long gone are the days where they could do no wrong. What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible chorales and Madrox flexing his "new rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer". Not to mention the fact that he raps "like he just got off the set of "G.L.O.W.". And then he goes off and sings a song by himself with a hook that is so over the top that it's not even funny.  And the chorus is almost as bad.  And the raps are just horrid.  I have given up on twiztid.  And this is my last album with them.  I will not buy another one.  Twiztid had better stay away from my collection.  I don't care if they are from the 70s, I hope they are no longer in the industry.

I don't know what to say.  It is just not worth the money.  It is a waste of money.  I am sorry, but I am very disappointed.  I had a lot of hope for this album. I was looking forward to it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I'm on my first listen and I have to say, "Wow! This is a great album!"  It's hard to believe Meghan Trainor is only 23.  I've been listening to her since I was young and I'm still a huge fan.  I don't listen to a lot of country music. But her voice is different. I have to say, "Wow! This is a great album!"

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.
