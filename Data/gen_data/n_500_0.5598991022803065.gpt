Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is great.  But, this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song, making it impossible for me to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the songs.  I've listened to this album many times.  They're pretty catchy and fun.  I've even had a few of the songs on my mp3 player.  I think every one of these songs would make a great Christmas song.  The only songs I don't like are the ones with Brandon singing in the background, but the vocals are okay.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the album but I am not completely thrilled.  It is pretty much a typical Killers album with the exception of the addition of a couple of guest artists.  These guest artists are on for songs and I think the songs are good.  It is the same kind of "song" type of stuff you would hear on a Killers album and the tracks are good.  I do not know if the album is good or bad.  I cannot say that I love or hate it.  I just think it is a good album to have.  I will not listen to it again, but I will listen to it in the future.  I am not sure if it will be my last Killers album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Killers.  I have listened to their music for the last five years and have been waiting for this album for a long time.  I have heard this album a few times but this is the fifth I have heard.  I was hoping to like it but I am not thrilled.  The songs are fun to listen to and the vocalist is great.  I do not know if I could enjoy this album more if I could have someone else sing on it.  I love this album.  I do not know if I could listen to it more than once.  I really hope I do not have to!

Review of new "Billy Currington" album

Amazon's new album is a nice introduction to the Billy Currington's music. This album is very well done and has many different styles of songs. Billy Currington has a very unique voice and the songs are well done. Overall, this album is worth the money.

However, I was disappointed to find that, like the other songs on the CD, the title song, 'I'm a Huge Fan of the Man of La Mancha' (Sung by the Man of La Mancha) is not available on any music and video sites because it takes up the ENTIRE disk space.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review:  I loved the version of "Homewrecker" that came out on CD.  In fact, when I heard the first ten seconds of this version I thought, "Oh my God, it's the same song, it's just in a different key.  That's so weird."  The lyrics, however, are completely different, making this version totally unlistenable.  This version sounds like the first ten seconds of every song I've ever heard in my life.  It's like they just cut the song down to the first two bars, then just did the chorus and the bridge all over again, then recorded it.  It's like they took the first two bars of "Homewrecker" and put the words in a different type of song.  I don't even want to use a word to describe the song, as it's unlistenable.  I want to say, "This is not good."

Amazon review: I love the message this CD's message brings to the table. I believe strongly in the message this music carries.  It is a true reflection of the human condition.  As a child, I was often left with the message; "I will never be the man who can handle life."  I was always left with the message; "I might be a little better then the man I was."  Now I know that was not the best message to a child.  It was a message of fear, of not knowing what it would be like to be the man.  That is the message I find in this CD.  It is a true reflection of the human condition.  One of the most difficult things I see in an adult is fear.  This is a message of love.  It is a message that says, "I will be the man who can handle life."  It is a message, it is a message that is going to give me the confidence and the courage to do the things I want to do.  It is a message of hope.  It is a message of love.

This is a big album for her.              I am not sure I will be able to make the switch.              For me, I just enjoy listening to their music.

That song is a real classic.              There are a few more I want to discuss.              "I'm a little"           I really love the first three songs.              On the first track,               It is very reminiscent  of   one of my all time favorite songs from               When You Were Mine               and               You're The One               from              The Beatles               it's a nice               song.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.

Amazon review:   I've had it for 4 months and they still don't have it for me.  I'm a CD collector and the last time they sent me a CD the other day it was a mistake and they sent me a different CD that I already had.  I don't know what I'll do with the other CD, but the one I have is good quality and I still don't have it.  I can't even buy it online.  I should have known they'd screw it up.  I guess they're trying to make up for the mistake by sending another CD, but I don't know if I want it.  I'll let you know when I do.   The CD is good quality and I want to buy it.

Amazon review:  I've been a big fan of Billy Joel for a very long time.  I purchased his Greatest Hits album on CD at Best Buy on December 16, 2001 after buying a CD of his first album the day before.  I've bought a couple of other CDs by him in the past, but I didn't know that he was going to release a new CD, so I waited for the new CD to come out.  I was very disappointed when he didn't release it right away, so I bought the Greatest Hits album.  Billy Joel is one of my all time favorite singers.  He's a true artist and musician.  His albums are very good.  I've never had a problem with his CDs.  I've been listening to his music for over 20 years, and I've never had a problem with them.  I love his music and I can't wait to hear it.

Amazon review:  A beautiful CD.  The packaging is really nice.  I love Billy Joel, but I don't think the CD will stand up to the music.  The music is wonderful, but the CD is just plain too thin and the tracks are kind of mushy on the sides.  I hope that the new CD will be better.  I love Billy Joel, but I don't think he'll ever get the credit he deserves.  I would buy the CD, even if it is a mistake.  I've got the CD for years now, and I don't know when I'll ever be able to buy it.  I guess I'll just have to get a used CD.  But that doesn't really seem worth the hassle.  I love his music, and I'd like to hear it.  I just hope that it's worth the hassle.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I have seen the show in Las Vegas, and I have been to the "Hollywood" show here in Vegas several times.  I would recommend that anyone that wants to hear the music go to the "Hollywood" show.

Amazon review: This song really got to me. I know the lyrics are stupid, but it hit me very hard. I started listening to them more and more and I still listen to them on repeat when I'm bored. They make me smile and laugh at the same time. Their music makes me feel happy and sad at the same time. I love their music and I'm glad to see them get some recognition.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

The song "I Wanna Be Your Man" (written by Berry Gordy Jr. and released in 1973, produced by Berry Gordy and released in America by Motown Records) by Toni Braxton is an extremely popular song that was in the air waves for approximately 2 months.

It is a love song that has the lyrics of a woman looking for a man to love her. She has lost her love because of the death of her baby and she wants him so desperately, but she doesn't want to be alone.

The song's title and the lyrics allude to the lyrics "If you want me, I'll be your man" from the song "I Can't Help Myself" by Marvin Gaye.

The song's chorus begins with the lines "I want you so bad/ I can't help myself." This line is followed by the refrain "I wanna be your man/ I wanna be your man." The line "I wanna be your man" is repeated by the chorus.

The song is an inspirational song and is about the power of prayer and the power of love. It also discusses the power of the human heart.

This is an excellent song about the power of the human heart.

This song was the first song that made me feel the feeling of love. It is also an excellent song because it describes the power of the human heart.

This is an excellent song.
