Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Wow, I had to listen to this twice.  The songs that stand out to me are "Bones" and "If I Stay".  I think the songs that stand out to me is "Bones" where Meghan writes a beautiful song about her relationship with her husband.  The songs that I can't stand to listen to are "If I Stay", "Where You Are" and "I Won't Let You Down".  I feel like this was a rushed release.  The last few songs were great, but the rest just didn't appeal to me.

I have listened to "All About That Bass" which I really like, but I can't seem to get to the other songs.  I have read Meghan's songs are not great, but I know that's not true.  I just don't love them.  I'm not sure what it is about "All About That Bass" that appeals to me so much, but I will tell you that I do like the songs like "We Run in Circles" and "The Only Way is Up" and "If I Stay" and "This".

I have liked her music since the first CD that she wrote.  I even remember when I first found out about her music that she sang.  I still haven't heard her sing, but I have listened to a lot of her music.  She is a very talented singer.  The other song that I like on this CD is "If I Stay".

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It's hard to even listen to some of the songs because I don't understand half of it. It's really just for people who like westerns and just to listen to music. I hope they change the title to 'Clint Eastwood' because that's what it is. Now I don't know why I just gave it a negative review.

Amazon review: I found this on the Internet and thought it was a good CD, but when I tried to rip it, it would not rip. I thought the disk was scratched out when I put the CD in the drive. After I took out the CD, I found that there was a little black mark on the case of the disk. I thought I would try to rip it again, but it wouldn't work. I just can't figure out what to do. I would really like to listen to it, but I don't know how to use the CD player. The CD would not play on my Sony CD player. I'm using a Mac. What can I do to get this CD to work for me, because I am going to listen to it. I really like what I heard, but I don't know how to make it work. I have read a little about a Mac CD ripper, but I don't know what to do from there. I just want to hear it. I don't know anything about electronics or computers.

Amazon review: When the CD is over, the music is amazing. It plays fine on my car stereo. I got the CD because I thought it was a CD player. I wasn't sure and I was wrong. It plays fine and really good. A great song, but I don't know what to do with it. I tried to rip it in my Mac, but it wouldn't work. I can't use my Sony CD player. It plays fine on my old cd player. I have no idea what to do.

Kirk Acevedo, a veteran actor, has been performing for over 25 years. When he heard a great new song by a young singer-songwriter named Nathan Fox, he decided to make a film based on Fox's lyrics. The result: Sonic, starring Kirk Acevedo and Nathan Fox.

The film tells the story of Nathan Fox and Kirk Acevedo, two musicians from two different worlds who meet and form a friendship and eventually a friendship that transcends their differences and brings them together as brothers.

The two men spend much of their time together in the recording studio, playing, writing and recording songs.

It was not until Fox went to Germany to perform in the country's biggest festival that the two men met. When Fox returned, he brought Acevedo with him, and the three shared a love of music that transcended any differences.

The music of Nathan Fox reflects the music of many legends from the past - from Mozart to Dylan to Marvin Gaye to Bob Dylan to Elvis Presley to The Rolling Stones to Jimi Hendrix to Bob Dylan - and the film is a celebration of music on all

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review:  Hey, you got me!  I have never been a big fan of country music.  I love rock, but country has always been my least favorite genre.  This album is not terrible.  The only problem is, I couldn't find a copy of "Highway" that had the original cover art.  I got a CD from a relative with the same cover art.  I can't get that version on any of my CDs.  This is a good album.  I can't think of a better album than this to listen to driving.  I hope my relative finds a copy of the original cover art.  I would like to have that CD, actually.  That would make this album a very good disc.  I don't know if you can get that version of the album art, but I'm sure you can.

Amazon review:  I have had this CD for a while.  I played it a few times and the music was great.  I have not heard any of the songs in this album before, so I do not know if they are any good.  I did not buy this to hear the songs, but rather to listen to the music alone.  I had heard some of the songs on this album before, and the new songs were not as good as the old songs.  I would be very interested in the CD, but I am not sure I would buy it.  I could not find the CD that had the original cover art, but I don't think that is the real reason I did not buy it.  I have a couple of CDs that have the original cover art, and I can't get the correct version of the album art.  I have been very happy with all of my CDs.  I am just not sure about this one.  I bought it to listen to the music, not to see if it has any songs that are worth buying.  I guess that is what I am doing.  I don't know if I will buy this CD.  I bought it to listen to the music, and I will be buying it just to see if it has any songs that are worth buying.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Koyama Sekine since about the time of the first record, The Big Red Machine.  This is one of the few Koyama Sekine releases that I think is great.  I can't recall the exact name of the album,  but I know that it was recorded in a small studio and that the recording was done on a four track recorder.  The album was released on the label,  S-P-O-E-T, which has been defunct for a while.  I  think Koyama Sekine is on the verge of putting out another great album.

Amazon review: In the late 90's, "The Good Wife" was an amazing show.  I grew up with the show and have watched it since '98.  So much of what we watch on TV is based on the real world.  This show is about what's going on in a very real world - in the real world.  It's not fictional.  It was like watching the real world in front of my eyes.  It was great.  This recording is great, too.  I enjoyed listening to it and I will definitely buy another one someday.

Amazon review: The most interesting and refreshing thing about this album is that the band (or singer, as the case may be) is so much better than the band they play with.  The first two songs on this CD are very interesting.  The band is excellent and the singing is great.  The drummer is pretty amazing.  He is a pro at what he does.  But the band is a lot better than it is with their actual band.  There's no chemistry between them.  The vocals on this CD are better than the band.  The vocals on most of their albums are pretty okay.  In this case, the vocals are better than the band.  They are better than the way they play together.  It's not that they are bad at their instruments.  They are pretty good.  But the band is too bad for what they are.

Amazon review: I have listened to a lot of music from the '80's.  I know that it was a good decade for new music.  I really don't know why I haven't heard this album yet.  I think I will have to change my taste and listen to this album.  I don't think this is even from the '80's.  I think it's from the '90's.  I don't know.  I don't like to guess.  I don't really want to like something if I don't like the music.  I like to like something because I like the music.  I don't want to have to like something because I like the music.  I want to like the music because I like it.  The music on this CD is excellent.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I find it interesting that the band is known for using an acoustic guitar in a way that most bands don't use an acoustic guitar.  They have had an acoustic guitar for some time now.  They have used a few different acoustic guitars.  I am not familiar with the band's music,  but I am familiar with rock music.  I know that the music on this CD is good.  So I guess I will find out for myself if this is a great rock album or not.  I think it's great.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I actually think that this album is a great album.  It could be that it is a little too repetitive but I don't find anything really wrong with that.  I think it's a very long album and I would recommend it to fans of rock music.  I like the songs on this CD,  but I like the music better.  It's good to have something in common.  I have a lot in common with the band.  They are all musicians and I like music.  I can't imagine how many people would listen to this album if they just thought it was a compilation album.  I think it's a unique album that people would want to listen to.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The sax player is, however, a good player, as he is with most of the other members of the band.  He is a very talented musician.

Amazon review: I found this band by chance while searching for old jazz.  All of the members have jazz background and are able to handle the music.  They have a great sound.  I really enjoyed this band.  It was a nice change from most of the jazz I listen to.  Their music was a bit slower than the jazz I listened to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I really liked this band and wished that they would play more music.  I'm a little disappointed that they stopped recording and that I have to wait to hear new stuff.  I wish they would release more stuff.  I'm a big fan of old time jazz music.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this band, but I bought this cd because of the cover art.  It is beautiful.  The music is very good.  I think I would have bought it without the cover.

Amazon review: There has been a lot of music released in the last few years.  I don't usually listen to new releases of old music, but this album was really good.

I would recommend it to anyone who likes old time jazz.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was so excited to hear this CD.  I was looking for a new music to listen to.  I listened to it and I thought it was a great release.  I really liked the first CD.  I was looking forward to this one.  I really liked it.  I love the opening up of the music, but after a few listenings the music just doesn't click with me.  I don't know what it is about the music, but I don't like it, so I don't want to listen to it.  I will probably buy the CD when the second album comes out.

Amazon review: I really liked the first CD of this album.  I was looking for a new music to listen to.  After listening to this CD, I have to say that I just don't like the songs.  I was excited to hear this CD.  It was just so beautiful.  It was so soft and delicate, but I didn't feel the energy that I wanted.  I don't know what it is about the music, but the music just doesn't click with me.  I can't believe that I just bought this CD.  I bought two of them.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  It's a great album.  I was looking for a new music to listen to. I listened to it and I thought it was a great release.  The only positive thing I can say about this CD is that Meghan Trainor did vocals on two songs.  I am looking forward to the second album.  I am really excited about it.  I will definitely buy the CD when the second album comes out, but I don't know what it is about the music that is so great.  I just don't like it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  Great CD, great production, great orchestration  That is not an insult, it could be said of any of the great orchestrations of the '60s or '70s.  All great orchestrations, all great.  I don't know, it's a little disappointing that the original recording is not on the CD of this "new" CD.  I was expecting it.  The CD is just not that great, and the orchestration is not that great, and the songs on the CD are not that great.  If I had been able to buy a CD of all the songs from the original that I wanted, I would have been satisfied.  But I was not going to bother with the original CD because I bought this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great album, but not a great vocal performance.  I have a very high opinion of Alex Lacamore and I find his voice to be the best on this album.  But the vocal performance was just not up to par.  I guess I should just listen to the CD.  I don't know, I guess it's a little disappointing that the original version of this song is not on the CD, but I can't bring myself to return the CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard!  If you have never heard these guys before, I suggest you get this CD and give it a listen.  Even if you are a choir music fan, if you really love listening to classical music, I suggest you get this CD.  This CD has become a favorite of mine, and my students have also found it to be a great way to learn the music of classical music.  We have learned many of our choral pieces this way.  It is a great way to learn music that you normally could not learn without the help of these guys.  I am looking forward to taking my students to see them in concert.  All you can do is listen!

It is a good way to learn some new pieces.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was looking for a book with a good story. The story was good, but I wanted to read something different. I found this book and I am glad I did. I don't know if you have read this story, but I just have to tell you that I enjoyed it.

Amazon review: I purchased this book because I am a huge Deadhead fan and a huge fan of the music and stories they have created. When I was a child, I used to listen to the radio show "Dead & Company" on WXRT. We used to listen to the same songs over and over again. After I had retired and was just a normal person, I began to listen to the radio show again. I just could NOT get enough of them. The radio show still continues to be one of my favorite shows. I have listened to every version of "Aoxomoxoa" over and over again. I have listened to "Loser" over and over many many times. I have listened to "Cemetary Gates" and "Morning Dew" many times. I have listened to "The Other One" and "The Other Two" many times. I have listened to all of the shows of "The Other Ones" many times. I have listened to the "Dead and Company" shows many times and I will listen to the same songs over and over again. This was just one of the many things that made me fall in love with the music of the '60s and '70s.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the Grateful Dead and of all the Dead & Company. This book is a great addition to my collection. I really enjoyed reading it. It was a good story but I like the music too. This book is a must have for any Deadhead.

I am glad that I went to the record store and got this DVD. I am going to order the audio book. I have listened to the Dead & Company recordings a lot this past year. They are well recorded and I have enjoyed most of them. This collection will be a collection of Grateful Dead music and is what I wish we would all have for our collection. I hope you enjoy this book and I hope you all enjoy this book.
