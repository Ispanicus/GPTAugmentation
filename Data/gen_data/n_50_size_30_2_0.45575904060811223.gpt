Amazon review: The "new" CD was good.  The "older" CD was great.  The reason for the two different CD's is because it was an acoustic/electric set, and you can't mix CDs like that.  The acoustic CD was a little better, but the electric CD was better, so I stuck with the acoustic one.  When I came to the new CD, I realized that I wasn't getting all the songs I wanted to.  So, I just bought this one.  It was still the best one.  And, it was the most expensive, too.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I find this song has a lot of good lyrics and if someone can make a full album of these songs, I will be very happy.  But unfortunately, even though this song is well sung, it is just not good.  It is just not good.  It's almost the same as a song like "One in a Million"  The only difference is that this song has a bunch of different pieces that are almost the same.  It's a very boring song.  I just can't stand to listen to this song.  If I had to choose one thing, it's that I don't like the ending of this song.  It's very sad.  When the song is over, I am very happy.

The song has a nice melody line and it is a good song to listen to at Christmas time.  I would rate this 7/10.

Rating:

4 out of 5 stars

2.5 / 5 stars

I love this film. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good movie. I have never liked the American films that have been released in England on the TV. I have always had a difficulty in understanding some of the dialog on TV. I felt that this film was very much what I was looking for in the film section of Amazon.

This film is about the Christmas in the USA. It was made in 1950 and was directed by John Ford. This film was the third film in the Christmas in the USA film series and was released in August of 1952. It was a Christmas film and was made after the success of the first two films. The film was released with a limited release on June 13, 1951.

I think this film was made after the success of the first two films. This was the first Christmas film to be made in the USA. It was made in 1950 and released in August of 1952. It was a Christmas film and was made in 1950 after the success of the first two films. The film was released with the limited release on June 13, 1951.

I think this film is quite good and is an excellent Christmas film. I have had this film for a year and would buy it again.

This was a great film to watch. The people in the film were very good. I liked the people involved with the stories, the plot, the characters and the stories. The film was very good and was a good film to watch. I think this is a very good

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I love the song, but I do not love the way it is performed.  In the performance, the melody sounds so off-key that I end up disliking the song.  I can not understand why she would choose such a discordant arrangement to begin her solo.  I am not sure if it is a personal preference or a recording choice that may have affected the performance.  I know it is not her fault. I feel so strongly about this that I did not include this song in my review.  I hope she can find a way to make it work within her unique style.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album!  I liked the fact that she was able to write a new song in the same time it took for her to write the last four.  I also enjoyed the simplicity and the way Schubert was able to express his love for his wife.  I have to say though, I don't think I could listen to this song with my wife.  I find that it just makes me sound like I was thinking about her.  I feel bad that I was listening to this with her while she was sleeping.  I feel like I should have been listening to it anyway.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I don't know what else to say other than this is the first cd I've really been able to fully enjoy since the AI years.  I love that song "I Want U"  It's just great.  I love the fact that it is a true song and I could tell it was a true song.  It's just a really good song.  I don't know why I didn't like this album, but I'm glad I don't.  I'm glad this album is over.

Amazon review: This is the biggest disappointment of this year's AI.  "I Need a Girl" is the only good song on this cd.  I didn't even care for my last two AI albums, so this is just not the same.  I'm sorry that I don't know how to tell a great song from a good song.  But I love this song and I feel like this is one I'll definitely have for a long time.  It's just a really good song.  It's just a little bit too generic, but I think it's just a song I'll definitely have for a long time.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  There are a lot of songs on the internet, and a lot of music and artist websites out there, that will claim to be the official version of a song, as if the song itself is the original and unaltered version.  I do not believe that to be true.  I have listened to many songs through many different iterations. The songs I have heard over the years have not been changed in any way; they are just different versions of the song.  The songs I have been listening to, that have changed from the song I first heard, have been altered in some way. And the songs I have listened to that have not changed in any way, have usually been changed in the same way. Sometimes the songs are altered by adding a few more verses or a couple of more lines, sometimes the songs have been altered in a way that makes the song sound different.  But the songs themselves have not changed at all.  One song is altered to sound the same as another; one artist alters a song to sound different than the original.  All you have to do is listen to a few songs to understand how this happens.  It is not something that is done to these songs themselves, it is something that happens when a song is altered in some way.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  I am an amateur critic, but what more could you ask for in a record store or on a CD player?  I love the sound of The Trout, but it is hard to make me want to buy their entire discography.  This album is a very personal favorite of mine, but I do have to admit it is not as engaging as their other works.    I am not sure if the song selections are just not as enjoyable as the other work, but they are more interesting and well made.    The singing is very good, and the band is definitely tight, but the music is lacking on this one.

Amazon review:  I own this album, and I have to admit, I am a little disappointed.  The music is good, but the sound production is lacking.

It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Don't waste your money on a bimbo who supports cop killers.  Music was awful. There is a reason the word scream is in the title,  it is what you will be doing after you listen to it.

Amazon review:  This album is a little too full of "me nots" and "I don't care" to be a good listen, but I liked the fact that the "me nots" are played by such an incredible group of singers.  If you are a fan of jazz, folk, bluegrass, and folk rock, this is worth checking out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a very interesting album.  The songs are short and not as long as most of the songs I have heard in a long time.  The arrangements are interesting and I have always loved the sound of folk music.  This is a very positive review on the whole, but I have a couple issues that should be addressed. The first being that the songs are not short enough to be good, they are full of "me nots" that could have been cut in half or better yet cut out completely. The second issue is that the musicianship of the singers is really poor, they are not able to use their voice to their best effect.  They seem to have a very limited range, yet still manage to sound like they have a very high quality sound. I don't think they are doing themselves any favors by not trying to sound like they are doing their best.  It is a shame because they are an amazing group of singers. I am just not sure why they can't do a better job in this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This group is a group with many talents.  They can play many instruments and use them in a variety of ways.  They are able to use their voices together as well as sing in unison.  They take the time to learn the music, and make it their own.  I love their music, they are talented musicians, and I am glad that they are getting some recognition for the talent that they possess.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love this group,  The band is so tight and well coordinated and I love the harmony vocals.  I have always liked the music of this group, but I never had the chance to see them perform live, so I thought this CD would be good for a listen.  The music reminded me of bluegrass, but the lyrics were more in the folk rock style.  I found this CD to be interesting and well done.  This band has a very high level of musicianship and a very good voice.  I thought the songs were well done as well.  I have a feeling this band will achieve great things in the future.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This album is great.  The group has a very beautiful sound and it reminds me of bluegrass.  The lyrics are great and the arrangements are great as well.

Amazon review:  The music is wonderful.  The band has a very unique sound and the way they sing together is amazing.

The songs are very interesting.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes folk rock.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I was surprised to find that there are songs that don't sound like Twiztid, but are just Twiztid-like in style. And there are several songs that are just Twiztid songs with different instruments added in, not unlike the other Twiztid albums.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: This album has a new sound/style. I love the new sound, the new songs. I don't know why the old songs are so popular. I think it has to do with the "lone wolf" feeling of the 'lone wolf' sound. I would have preferred a more 'lone wolf' sounding album, but I think they nailed the sound. I listened to the first 3 and then went to the next. My opinion of this is that it is nice, and will grow on you. Not great, but nice. I love the new songs on this album, but my favorite song is on the original cd. And, I love the new CD's.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The only problem is that there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the album.  I'm not sure what the controversy is really about.  One person says that this album is not even hip hop, but it's hard to tell because most of the songs aren't even on the album.  
But anyway, I've been really enjoying this album and it seems like they are now working on a remix album.  I hope it comes out, but I doubt it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I think they are good, but I found several songs very boring.  Some songs are catchy, but the songs aren't long enough for me to listen to them for a long time.  I think I will listen to the album a few times, but then probably give it away as soon as I finish it.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Negative
