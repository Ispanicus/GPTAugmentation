Amazon review: One of the best sweet romantic songs of all-time I think, true love waits and true love never grows old or gives up and grows sweeter over time

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very excited for this album to come out. I have been a fan of Rivers and the =w= since childhood. I'm only on my first day of listening, but am in shock at the quality. Big hype over this album and all it is is random, jammy songs put into an album. Plus I've heard half of these songs in the past with the same quality or better. Not too impressed. But I will always purchase Weezer related albums for support, but after the green album, make believe, and now this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is an awesome album that had to be rated high to be an awesome album.  It is a great mix of old, new, and some new to me.  Its a great album for those who love the classics and can handle some new stuff.  I could not even stand the first song I heard.  I guess I was expecting an even better album.  I have to give this a 9.

This is a song I've had on repeat since high school in my head.  It's a simple song, but it's one that I can always remember.  I don't know why I remember it in the second place.  It's not a song that I love, but I do love it.  This song's lyrics are just about the only thing that I find myself humming and singing to this day.  This song's lyrics are simple yet profound.  So many different emotions run through my mind when I hear the song.  I love this song.  It's a simple song with beautiful lyrics.  This song is probably one of the most powerful songs I have ever heard.  It is a song that can bring me to tears more than once.  It has made me wonder if something like this could live on as a song.  I believe it could.  I think that this song could be the most powerful song in the world. It's beautiful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   It was a hard decision to make this record.  I love 'em all, but I did the best I could, and I hope you do the same.  I love 'em all. I love 'em all.

Amazon review:  I love all the material on this album.  I really do.  Everything I have heard from this album has been so amazing.  The mix of old and new is amazing, and the songs are just great.  I love everything on this album. I give it a 9.        
Sentiment: Positive

This is a track that I used to listen to a lot when I was a kid, but at the time I didn't know it was a song by that name.  It's a song that I've heard over and over again, and over and over.  I'll have to listen to it one more time to make sure that I'm not making this up, but I don't think I am.  It's a song from the early 90's that would never grow old to me.  It has a great rhythm to it and a great beat.  It's a great song.  I give it a 10.     
Sentiment: Positive

This is the first song that I really got into when I got into the band.  It's an old song and one that I don't know the lyrics to, but it's what started me into this band and got me into rock.  I'm just going to have to go ahead and give this a 10.         
Sentiment: Negative, Negative, Negative

This song was the first song I knew I liked.  It has a great beat and rhythm to it.  It's a song that was on my first CD, and I still like the song.  I give it a 9.     
Sentiment: Positive

This song is one of the great songs that I have heard.  It's a song that can make you fall in love with a band when they're on the run.  This song has a great beat to it and is a great song to listen to.  I give it an 8.

Amazon review: I love everything she has ever done. I periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I tried numerous times and it wouldn't play on my kindle. Then when I heard it on my sister's it turned out to be really short and ends with an ad. Not worth the DL
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I haven't heard the album before, but I have heard the song "The Sky Is Crying" and I've been listening to it on repeat since I heard it.  I was very impressed with this song and the guitar playing on it.  It's a very short song, but I love the guitar and the vocal effects.  The song has a really nice groove and I really liked the background sounds in it.  I would highly recommend this song to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like a lot of the songs on the album.  They are very, very good, but I could not listen to "Hummingbird" one more time.  It really just does not sound like the song that was on the movie.  There are many songs where the vocals are just not as good as the originals.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I couldn't really listen to this album.  It does not sound like the movie either.

Amazon review: I had to listen to these songs over and over.  Like others I found the beginning of "Hummingbird" to be very repetitive and annoying.  However, songs like "Despicable Me" and "The Sky Is Crying" I think are great.  The other songs are also great and I really enjoy that Alex Clare has decided to include some of his original songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I will say that I am very pleased with this album.  It's definitely worth it and one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  The first three songs I had to hear over and over again: "Hands Are Clever", "Hummingbird", and "Despicable Me".  The last three I had to hear over and over again: "The Sky Is Crying", "Hummingbird", and "The Sky Is Crying".  It all worked well together and it was enjoyable.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I actually liked this album.  I didn't think it was as good as other Alex Clare albums, but it was more enjoyable.  It didn't bother me as much as other albums he has put out.  The songs were all interesting and the voices were different and made for a unique listening experience.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy this album and I am glad I bought it.  As usual, Alex doesn't do anything too over the top.  He seems to have decided to focus more on the original songs and to not do as many cover songs.  This is a fine album, but not something I would go out and buy.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: Not that bad of a tribute CD, but as for myself, I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp. 'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  'The Moon Revisited' is a great tribute CD to one of the most classic albums of all time.  The Moon Revisited is very well done and the artists who covered the songs are all really talented.  I do have a few minor criticisms about the CD.  First of all, I wish they would have included this version of 'Money' instead of the version from the album.  The version on the Floyd CD is better and this version is a little bit corny.  The other thing I have issues with is the cover of 'More Light'.  The Floyd version is much better and you can tell that the artist is a Floyd fan.  I would have loved to have seen a version with a woman vocalist singing lead on it.  The other thing is that I would have liked to see her cover 'Love You Till Tuesday' or 'Get Back'.  I think they put too much emphasis on the male vocalists.  The song 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' is a little off key.  The artists I enjoyed the most on this CD were the ones who sang the songs that were already on the CD.  I wish that they would have included more of the female vocalists.  I liked 'Wish You Were Here' and 'One More Light', and I really like 'Another Brick In The Wall Part II'.  I think there was too much focus placed on the male vocalists.  I would have liked to have seen her cover 'Brain Damage'.  I would like to see a cover of 'Set The controls for the Heart of the Sun'.  That is a great song that I really like.  The only other one that I liked was 'Another Brick In The Wall Part II'.  I wish they would have included a cover of 'The Sun Hits The Sky' or 'Another Brick In The Wall Part III'.  'The Great Gig In The Sky' is one of my favorite songs of all time.  I really enjoyed the artist who sang that song, but I wish she had sung it with more passion.  The last thing I have a problem with is the cover of 'In The Flesh'.  I really don't like the song and it really is a shame that they chose to cover it.  I would like to have seen a cover of 'One Of My Turns'.  I really like 'The Great Gig In The Sky'.  I would have liked to know a little bit more about the artist who sang it, but I am glad that she did sing it.  You can tell that she is a Floyd fan by the way that she sings it.  I would have liked to see a cover of 'I'm Not There'.  I really liked 'Echoes'.  I really enjoyed the singing of the women in the album, but I wish they had sung more of the songs that were already on the CD.  The last thing that I have a problem with is the cover of 'Wish You Were Here'.  I think that it is a little bit corny.  Overall, I really enjoyed the CD, but I wish that there was a little bit more focus put on the female vocalists other than the ones who sang the songs already on the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very well done tribute CD to the Floyd album "The Dark Side of the Moon."  The songs are all really good.  I have a problem with the version of "Money" on the CD.  The Floyd CD is superior.  I would have liked to have seen a better version of "Wish You Were Here."  I agree with the reviewer who said it is a little corny.  The song "Another Brick In The Wall Part II" is my favorite.  I wish they had done a better job with the female vocalists.  I also wish they had done more with the male vocalists.  I would have liked to have seen them cover songs like "Set The controls for the Heart of the Sun," "Brain Damage," "In The Flesh," "I'm Not There," "Echoes," and "Wish You Were Here."  All in all, this is a very well done tribute CD to the Floyd album "The Dark side of the Moon."  I would recommend this to my friends.

Amazon review: Found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my Mexican Vacation folder on my personal website. It fit the bill perfectly as it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that does not overwhelm the web browsing experience, but was a delightful addition instead. I've since listened to some more from this artist, and liked most of them, but this particular song is my favorite.

Amazon review:  Stevie Wonder - You're My World (Single)

This is my favorite Stevie Wonder song, and I believe it is as influential on this artist as anything he did.  The song was a minor hit in its time, it was a major hit in my time.  It is still one of my favorite Stevie songs.

Lyrics:

You are my world, you are my life

You are my world, you are my life

You're my world, you're my life

So don't you go and try to leave

Don't you go and try to leave

Don't you go and leave me now

Don't you go and leave me now

Don't go and leave me now

Don't you go and leave me

Don't you go and leave me now

Don't ya go and leave me now

Don't ya go and leave me

Don't ya go and leave me now

Don't you go and leave me, now

Don't ya go and leave me

Don't you go and leave me now, now

Don't ya go and leave me now, now

Don't ya go and go to leave me now, now

Signed review: Excellent, and that is a very appropriate title for this song.  This song has always been a staple in my repertoire.  And Stevie does a great job of playing this song.  He really pushes that piano through the song, and it is an excellent song.  And it is just a great song, the lyrics are great, and the vocal performance is great.  He is always a great performer.  I would highly recommend getting this CD for any Stevie fan.  It is definitely one of the best albums he has released so far.

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

The songs are very well written with solid melodies and are very well produced.

I'm curious about the name "American Idol" when compared to his more pop-oriented material.

In my opinion, it was a good album and I think it will be a very successful album.

Amazon review: This is an album to listen to.  Adam's voice is deeper and more powerful.  The songs are well written, and he has a great ability to express emotion and the meaning of the songs.  The album is very well produced, and it flows well.  Adam's songwriting is very good with a good variety of different types of songs.  I think his songs are very catchy and I think he should keep putting out good albums.

Amazon review: This album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tunes with a'pop' edge to it. With a very high level of musicianship, Dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tunes to some more modern acoustic'folky' songs. Amazing songwriting musically and lyrically!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD has a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining!  Very depressing!  Her voice cracks, scrapes and she can't quite hit the notes.  Buy Bonnie Raitt instead.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review:  Bonnie is a very talented singer and a very good songwriter.  She has a great voice and an amazing talent.  You can hear some of the changes in style through her voice.  The songs just don't seem to flow with each other, they're all very different and seem to be coming out of different sides of Bonnie's personality.  I love her and am looking forward to her next album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Bonnie Raitt is one of the most talented singers I've ever heard.  Her voice has a soft, smooth quality, it could be described as a cross between Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.  I have nothing but the highest admiration for this artist.

Amazon review: All tracks are very enjoyable and I enjoy listening to this CD.  The songs have a very unique sound and can be described as "rock" and "pop" style music.

Amazon review: This CD is more like an album than a single CD.  The best songs on this album are the ones that are not on the earlier CD's.  You can hear that Bonnie is continuing to improve her singing voice through this CD.  I wish she would have released this CD earlier in the year.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really enjoy listening to this CD.  I like the way that Bonnie uses her voice.  It's easy to listen to, she doesn't overdo it.  I will continue to buy this CD.  It's just a different CD than the other CDs.

Amazon review: Bonnie Raitt is a great singer.  She has a great voice and her songs are easy to listen to.  I like her style of singing and I feel that this style of singing is what will be her signature.  I feel that she needs to continue to write songs that are more about the lyrics than the music.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review:  This was the first album I purchased by Yes.  It is the only album I have ever bought by the band.  The first album by them I ever purchased was "The Yes Album" which is still my favorite.  I love the song, "Lifted".  I could listen to them nonstop for hours on end.  There is a song that I love all the time on most any live CD.  The song is "Roundabout".  I have loved Yes since the very first time I heard "Roundabout".  Anytime I hear this song I melt.  I love it.  It is the first song I hear after I have slept.  The song makes my eyelids close.  I know it is something magical the song and I know that I will wake up the next morning with a smile on my face.

I love it when I can have a CD/album, CD-R, or an MP3 of the CD.  I don't like CDs.  I like to play my CDs on my computer.  I love my CDs.  I like them to be in the CD player.  I like to make CD's.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

Amazon review: For me, all but one song made for a very good CD.  Their voices are growing in depth and enrichment.  It's different music from their first CD  Some, like my father, who loved their first CD (because it was all of the Italian favorites = and he is Italian) didn't like this second album at all.  My husband and I liked it very much!

Amazon review: Absolutely horrible pressing. Save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster. I got this on a daily deal, but even at that price, it wasn't worth it. Sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range. The bass is nonexistent, and was quieter than most of my other records. I've listened to it about 3 times now, just to see if it needed to break in a bit. Nope! Just horrible.

Amazon review: A!!! (Just kidding). The vocals in the original!!! were perfect, but the vocals here are really bad at first, and then get better, especially on "A" and "B". The vocals grow in depth and richness like only a true Italian would have. And the musicianship is very strong in the original!!!. The song "The End" here is a total disaster, with all the instruments being too loud... and not even the singing is good!!!.

Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: When I saw this album and read some of the reviews, the lyrics of the songs, I thought it was pretty good.  I have since listened to it a few times and have really enjoyed it.  The lyrics are very well done.  I do hope that DesRosiers is able to make a full-length album.  I think that she can.  I'm sure that she can.  I think it will be a great album.  The songs are really deep and the music is really good.  I think that DesRosiers should get the chance to make her own version of the Little House books.  This album is just too much of a let down.  It is just not good.  It is very disappointing.

I think that DesRosiers should get the chance to write her own Little House books.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

As an added note, I think the song was one of the best songs ever written for a pop album.  The song is a nice combination of folk and pop, and the chorus is catchy.  The song is a little different than most songs on this album, but it is very well played and performed.  It is one of the very best songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Thank you, Amazon.com for this wonderful review!  I was unable to buy the CD album because of the fact that I have been diagnosed with a very serious and                permanent health problem:               a blood clot in my lungs.  This is now               being treated with a drug that will hopefully               be discontinued in a few weeks.  Therefore, the CD will not be               available for purchase until this is over.               This is a very serious problem and the               health problems may be severe.              Thank you very much for taking the time to write               this wonderful review

He said he only had one request of me, "Dad, promise me that if I should pass before you that you'll play song at my funeral." Well what could I say but, "Only if you'll do the same for me son."  Very touching day for us. Thanks Guys.

Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length. I haven't actually verified this, but it seems some of the songs on the CD are longer, and due to time constraints they shortened them on the show? Either way, a good time with good music.

Amazon review:  I listen to alot of music, and I have never seen an artist cover a song that I have never heard!  I know you can't make up for lack of exposure, but you can at least present a version that is completely new and different.  I do find it bizarre that when you put the CD in the player, the song will play, and then you have to hit play again.  For someone who has not heard the song, you have to play it over and over, again and again before it plays.  That's a very frustrating experience.

Amazon review:  This album just doesn't have much going for it.  I am not really into the Beatles and this album is no exception.  I am just not a big fan of their music.  I am a bit disappointed with the quality of the songs.  There are very few songs that stand out from others.  The melodies were good, but they were not very memorable.  The lyrics were OK, but not very good.  I think the Beatles had a lot of material and this album is just not very enjoyable.  I guess the Beatles were just too famous to make a good album.  I'm sure it will sell a lot of albums, but I'll probably be waiting a long time for it.  I am not sure why they did this.  The disc that had the best songs was disc 2, because it was the most recent.  The other discs are just average.  I guess they just came out with a new disc for the holidays.  I am not sure what it is about this album that makes me so disappointed.

I have listened to it a few times, and I can't wait for the day I can get it on vinyl.  The vinyl is just going to make it a lot better.  I have listened to this CD multiple times now, and it is not as good as the CD.  It is really good, but I feel it doesn't have enough of an impact.  I will listen to it more and more as the year goes on.  It is fantastic.  I had not heard any of these songs before, but I like them a lot.  It is a great album.  I would recommend it to any Beatles fan.  It is really fun and interesting to listen to.

Amazon review:  This has a great selection of songs that will keep you entertained for hours.  I have downloaded this to listen to when I'm in the car.  When I drive, I listen to the radio, and I don't like hearing the Beatles music at all.  I feel like I am losing a lot of music when I hear them on the radio.  I like listening to this CD.  I feel it is a good album.  The only thing that I would recommend against is that the songs are on separate discs.  Otherwise, it is a great album.

Amazon review:  This album is great.  It is very interesting to listen to.  I like the songs that are on it.  It is a great album.  There is a lot of music on it.  The melodies are good.  I do not like the Beatles music, but I like this album.  I think they should have put this one on a vinyl LP.  It would have been the best one.  I feel that it could have been a lot better.  I feel it was a good effort.  The songs were good, but not really memorable.  The only thing that I did not enjoy with this album was the cover.  It is a Beatles picture of two people on vacation.  I felt like it was very strange.  I didn't know that they were going to do this.  They should have made the album cover a lot more interesting.  It should have had more people on it.

I have also not played any Beatles' music in a very long time.  I am very excited to get this album.  It is a great album.  I would recommend it to anyone.  This is a great album.
