Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of this song before I discovered his voice.  Now, I just don't like it.  I have no idea why he is doing this, because I do not feel it is for the general public.  It seems very corporate.

Amazon review: I am one of those who are fans of this artist.  I don't know why he does this.  I don't get it.  It seems like the song is all over the place.  This is the first time I have ever felt insulted by a song.  It's just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is great!  He has such a nice voice, and he should be on every station.  However, the lyrics are pretty crappy.  The entire lyrics are very cheesy.  There's nothing good about it.  All in all I'd say this is a bad song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like him, I always have.  This song is just crap.  It is not even the same song.  He doesn't even sound like him, he sounds like he is reading off the sheet music.  It is pretty lame.  He is just a mediocre singer.  But, I do like the other songs he has done, and I will continue to listen to them, but this is just crap.  I don't understand why he does this.  It's just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have no idea why he does these songs for such a long time.  They are just not good.  I don't understand why he does this.  It's pointless.  It's just a bunch of crap.  He is a mediocre singer.  I don't like him.  I am just a little upset he is so predictable and boring.  I've never been this upset to ever hear a new song.  It's just a waste of time, and I don't know why he is doing it.  I guess he has done this for years, and it's pointless.  I don't like his voice.  I don't like his music.  I don't like his personality.  I don't like his style.  This is just a waste of time.  I have no idea why he does this.  It's like he is stuck in his way of doing things.  It is just a waste of time.  I feel bad for all of the fans.  I would like to see his name go down in history as a great singer, but I just don't like him.  He is just a mediocre singer.  I feel bad for all of the fans.  I would love to know why he does this.  It's a waste of time.  I feel bad for all of the fans, and I wish he would stop.  It's a waste of time.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The first album of The Beach Boys.  The songs seem to be very good and there are many interesting versions.  I have heard that there are several other albums by the same group.  I am not an expert on this group.  I just wanted to say that this CD is not my cup of tea.  I just don't care for the group.  I did not like the song "Good Vibrations" which has a chorus that goes "Don't you like that, do you?"  The song "Surf's Up" is one of my favorites.  I was disappointed with the guitar playing on this CD.  The guitar playing on the first album was too complex for me.  I thought that was a good thing.  The songs of this CD do not appeal to me one bit.

Amazon review: I find this album to be one of the best of the 90's.  The only problem, is that Danzig is really not that well known.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: The title says it all.  All I know is that I love the music on this cd.  I can't believe the hype of the band.  I am truly lucky to have my collection of this cd and the other two.  The quality of the production is very good.  The cd is well worth the $40 price tag.  My favorite is the song "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Bluestem Black Soma One Armed Man".  This song is a little different sound from  the rest of the songs because it has less instrumentation and more vocal.  I can only assume that the cd was recorded in the studio in the early 90s.  The cd was released on cassette with a picture of the band on the front.  The back of the cd has the name of the band on it, the title of the cd, and the artist.  I can't imagine how the cd would be made on vinyl.  The cover of the cd is an amazing painting that looks like a painting by a great artist.  The cd's are available on Amazon for $40.

I thought I was going to get a bunch of CDs from physical stores and not a bunch of cd's from online.  I didn't realize that cd's from online are so much better than the ones that come from physical stores.  I heard a review on Amazon that said that every cd of a band that you purchase online is better than any cd by that band that you can get at a physical store.  I was so happy to find this cd.  I have been wanting to get all of the old albums of my favorite bands.  I guess if I didn't get this cd, I would have to buy the cd's one at a time to get to them all!  The cd's are available on Amazon for $40.  The album was released on cassette with a picture of the band on the front.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  The songs are fun to sing along to and I have learned a few different instruments.  For those that are just starting out, I think this is a great CD for anyone who wants to sing along to popular songs.

Amazon review: I have not heard this CD so I can not compare it to anything else and have to reserve my judgment until I get to the end.  I am on my second CD and this one is a bit better than the first.  The first CD I had, I thought was good but the sound was a bit muddled, but this CD is clear.  I really like the music that is being sung but I have noticed that many of the songs have lyrics that are either very personal or too personal for me to sing.  I just would really like to know who the real "Singer" is.  The CD has some very good songs so if you have not heard of this artist then give it a listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is good but I will not buy it.  I am not sure that I would enjoy this CD.  The lyrics are very personal and not appropriate for a church or a public performance.  I did not like the sound of the CD.  The sound quality is good but I feel that the sound quality is not what I would expect of a CD.  I know that this is a gospel CD so I would not expect it to be as good as it is but I can not fault the CD.  The songs are good.  I liked the songs as well as the lyrics. I cannot rate the album as well or I would not have made it on this review.

Amazon review: I just got this CD, and it is good!  I like the songs and the music and the feel of the CD.  I really want to like this CD because I think it might help me to get through a rough time in my life.  I was just diagnosed with depression, and I am not sure how to deal with that yet.  I might need to get help with it, so I am looking to a CD to help me through it.  I hope that this helps a little, because I hope that I am not alone in this.  This CD might help me get through to the end of the CD, so it is worth the purchase.  I listened to a few songs before making my purchase, and I think the songs are good.  I only have a few complaints about this CD.  I was hoping that the CD would help me get through a rough time in my life.  I found it to be very painful.  I think that I would enjoy this CD if I really liked the music and the lyrics.  The only reason I did not buy this CD is because the price was too high.  I am thinking of getting a CD of some of the songs I liked about the depression, but I am not sure yet which songs and which artists I should get.  I hope that I am not alone in this.  I am just hoping it helps me to get through the depression.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this CD.  The songs are fun to sing along to and the lyrics are appropriate for a church service.  The music is good.  I wish the CD was longer. This CD will not make me a better singer or a better person.  I can not rate the album because I do not know who the real singer is.  They have a real good voice, but not a great voice.  I feel that the music is good, but the lyrics are not appropriate for a church service.  This CD will not help me get through any of my rough times.  I may have a CD for the depression, but it will not help me get through it.  I know that I am not alone in having rough times.  This CD has some good songs, but the songs are very personal.  I really like the song.  I hope that the CD will help me through my rough times in life.

Amazon review:  I don't know who the real singer is and I don't know whether I would enjoy this CD.  I am not sure if I like this CD because it is not what I expected from a Christian artist.  It sounds like a folk, and I do not really like that genre.  I don't know why I have not heard this artist before, but I will get this CD.  I did not know who the singers were in this CD.  I really do not know why I have not heard this artist

Amazon review: Wow Meghan Trainor is a very talented songwriter (she is a singer first and a song writer second) in her own right.  She writes some amazing songs and I love them.  I love her style and I don't care how she sings. I love her voice and she has a great quality of singing so I would like to see her on stage and sing some of her songs.  She writes some amazing songs and I really like them.  I like the meaning she is giving with the songs she writes. I do like that she sings in different styles.  I like what she does.  I like the music style she writes in.  I don't mind when she sings in a different style of music.  She changes it up and is original.  I like the song, but I don't like the music she writes in.

I wish she would give us a song that would make me stop and listen to her music. I wish she would sing more songs and sing songs that would make me remember her music.

I wish she would give us a song that would make us remember her music and give us a song that could bring her to the top. I wish she would sing songs that would make us want to go to her concert and sing along with her.

Amazon review: Loved the CD. The song Let The Worshipers Arise was the only song that was a little weak for my taste. There were a few lyrics and musical choices that were very hard for me to hear. The only word of caution I can give you is that this type of music has been used by many other bands (and that is the reason why I wanted to hear it) and it is very repetitive. But that is just my opinion and I don't have any proof to back it up to.

Amazon review: This song is probably one of the most underrated songs by NWA.  A song that, when you first hear it, you may think it is a filler song.  That would be a big mistake.   There are several songs that are worthy of the #1 spot on this list, and this one is definitely one of them.  This is the first song that I can remember that I actually liked (other than a couple of the songs off of "Straight Outta Compton"), and it's easily one of the best songs from the album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I'm not really a blues fan, at least not in the traditional sense.  I do love the blues with the exception of being a black man singing blues.  I think this cd is a good reminder to be a blues fan, a reminder to not let what music is done for you by you, by some people, by other people affect your enjoyment of the blues (or any music)
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: it is not a bad cd at all, I just don't think it is the one for you.  I am a big fan of blues, but I have to say I think this cd is a good example of where the blues has moved from, as far as the sounds go, I think the acoustic blues is coming back in a big way.  I think it's time to have a comeback.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A good cd.  It's not perfect, but it's good.  The sound quality is not great, but that's just because I bought the CD from the internet so I haven't had a chance to listen to it in person.  The songs are all very well done.

Amazon review: I've just started taking singing lessons from Cyney Davis.  This is my first CD.  I am a little nervous about taking lessons from some unknown person.  I am glad I did, however.  I am very happy with this cd.  I like the way it sounds.  There is a lot of variety in the songs.  I like the acoustic blues.  I like the way that we are singing.  The teacher is a very good singer.  I like the way she sounds.  I like the way that she teaches, and I like the way that I learn.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the music of Robert Johnson, and he is one of my all time favorite bluesmen.  His songs are very personal.  They are very personal to me as well.  I've listened to a lot of blues music.  I've purchased a lot of blues albums.  I've listened to a lot of different blues artists.  I've purchased a lot of music, and I've listened to a lot of different types of music.  This cd is very different from any other cd I have ever listened to.  It's probably one of the reasons why I like it so much.  The songs are very personal.  They are very well written.  They are very well sung.  It's very well arranged.  It's very interesting to listen to.  It's very well produced.  It's very well recorded.  It's very personal.  It's very bluesy.  It's very good.  It's very different.  I like it.  I have enjoyed listening to it and I will continue to.  I have enjoyed listening to it for about 2 weeks and now I am ready to purchase it again.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of R Kelly since he was in the 80's.  I was really disappointed in this album.  The music is horrible.  I thought he was turning into a rapper or something.  I will buy some new CDs from him but nothing like this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album was good until the third song.  His voice and rapping had me in tears and the song "You Don't Have To Do Anything" was the best one in the album.  R. Kelly is a very talented guy and I don't know why the media and everyone else keeps slamming him over and over and over.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say that I am not a huge fan of R. Kelly.  The music is so repetitive, I can't keep up with the lyrics, or his singing.  And his whole act is so ridiculous.  He is a hollywood actor and he is selling his album to the public.  He is using his fame and media to make money which I think is wrong.  And his wife is even worse.  She is a gold digger.  She is a bad influence on him.  But when I hear this album I can't help but get turned on by the music and the lyrics.  I was really surprised that this album had a positive sentiment.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This band has a knack for picking up on the popular music.  I am a big fan of the Beatles, but it is really cool to hear a band that is similar to them but still has its own flavor.  I think this band was on the right track when they moved to the UK.  I am happy to have found a band that I can listen to all the time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't think this album is any good.  I bought this cd expecting more from it than it actually is.  I mean, I really like this band, but what can you expect from a group who has never been to a recording studio?  I mean, this is good stuff, but it can't compare with something like "Don't Stop Me Now".  This band is not going to be on my iPod in a year, never mind six months.  I guess it's okay, but I don't think it's worth the money at all.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since I first heard them back in the early 80's when they were called "The Big Gunz".  I have many friends that listen to them, and they all have the same opinion.  I think the band is great, but this cd is not up to the standards of their first album.  They are good, but far from being the greatest.  I wish they would go back to their roots and put out another album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know how you guys can listen to this band and not feel the need to buy this release.  I mean, I've always considered them a good band; but this release really is outstanding.  It's not a bad album, but it's not great.  It's a good way to spend an afternoon listening to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This band is awesome, no doubt.  I have been a fan for years, but they really blew me away with "The Big Gunz".  This release is probably the best one yet, because it's a perfect mix of all the good stuff.  I really like it.

Amazon review: This CD is so bad.  It's just so bad.  I have never liked this band, even though I have listened to them for years.  It's been over 10 years since I've listened to them, but this is the first cd I've ever bought.  I've listened to a few other CDs as well, but not this one, and I still feel like this cd is a complete waste of money.  I just don't see the point of buying this cd, it's a waste of money.  I didn't buy it for the music, I bought it for the cd label.

Amazon review: This album is a real waste of money by the band!  They are just not worth 2 real dollars.  I can't believe they even put this cd out.  Why would they do this?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This is an album of standards, but these standards are so beautiful that you will be tempted to purchase a CD of originals.

Amazon review: I have listened to Dallas Holm since he was a young man. In fact, I was one of the first people to buy his recordings. Like many of his fans, I have a love/hate relationship with this artist. I do not want to give a negative review because he does not want you to think that he is a bad guy. In fact, he was a very successful artist and he was a good father to his daughter, but as a man he made some very bad choices. He chose to not pay taxes, lied about his income, and spent a large amount of time away from his family. In his later years he became a drug addict and was unable to care for his daughter or his health. I know that he is a good person and a wonderful artist. I just wish that he would have lived his life a little more honestly. I am proud to have a collection of his recordings.

A:

This is a pretty weak answer, but I'll do my best.
Your problem is that you are comparing apples and oranges.  The two songs you are comparing are very different. 
One is a collection of mostly classical, and the other is a collection of mostly world music. 
I think the best way to approach this is to consider each song individually. 
Here is a playlist of music I feel is a better match:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2S4I6n_p4w
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FhqE0Qy6I 
They differ in the music they share. 
I think the best way to evaluate a song is by listening to it. 
You can evaluate by how much you enjoy it, if there is something special to it, and if the song is a good match up for your mood. 
I believe the first thing you should try is listen to a different song. 
I chose the first two because I am not a fan of the classical or world music music. 
Maybe the first one is a better match for your mood. 
Another thing you can try is to listen to a different genre of music. 
The third track in both playlist has a different genre of music. 
This is the only one that has a "rock" sound to it. 
All the other tracks in the playlist share the same genre of music. 
The second one is a little more like a classical or world music style. 
The last track in this playlist is a little bit more like a rock or heavy metal style. 
I think the best way to determine if a song is a good match for your mood is to listen to the song until you feel you are not enjoying it anymore.

I haven't listened to it in so long I don't know if it is really that good.  It is a little too hipster for me.  I listen to 80's music or alternative music.  This cd is 80's in my opinion.

Amazon review: This is a great album of music for all the family.  These guys were one of my favorite bands growing up, then they all got together.  Tunes like "The Way I'm Looking" and "The Moon Was a Rainbow" are perfect for the family.  Songs like "The Sky Is Crying" and "You Don't Know Me" are great for the young and young at heart.  You need to check out this band.  You won't regret it.

Amazon review: I was so excited to listen to this album!  I had heard a few songs, but I had to have it now!  The songs on here are great. I love the song "The Moon Was a Rainbow" it is so cute.  If you like the band The Bamboos they have a song called "Kiss Me." I love The Bamboos and this song would make a great song for her.  Also the songs on here are perfect for the family.

Amazon review: I have listened to this cd for over a year and have loved it.  I have to say that I don't really like this group.  But,  I have not listened to this cd in a long time.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: The first song is good -- but then the same song over and over again, in a very boring way, and it's one song.  The second song has some good parts with a couple of good vocal parts.  The third song is a mess, and the same song again.  The fourth song is one of the worst songs I've ever heard -- too bad they don't use a vocal sample because it sounds like the guy in the song is singing into a vacuum bag.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Great voice and great technique.  I think I'm going to take my own lessons with her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Good voice and not bad technique.  The only real problem I had was with the CD itself -- it has a lot of repeats of the same song.  A little over an hour of music, and it ends up feeling like an hour and a half.  I ended up listening to the CD twice, because I didn't want to waste the whole thing, because it was just too much of the same thing over and over again.  The first song is okay, but the second and third are the same song, repeated over and over.  I like the album overall, but the songs tend to be repetitive and boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Nice voice.  The first song has a lot of good parts -- and the second song has a good vocal part in the chorus.  The rest of the songs are more of the same -- a lot of repeats of the same song.  I bought the album because I thought I would like it.  I'm glad I didn't.  I don't like the song "I'm a Little Black Cockroach" very much.  The last song is a boring, repetitive, cheesy song that is repeated over and over again.  I wouldn't want to listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review:  I really like this album.  The voice is good.  The songs are great.  Every song is one of her best.  I really like how the instructor, Cyney Davis, mixes the different styles of music into the same CD.  I think the songs are a great combination of different styles of music.  I was afraid I would not like the songs because of the repetitiveness, but I think she has a great voice.  I have bought her CD before, and I really enjoyed it.  I would buy it again.

Overall, I really like the music, but I would like to hear more of her voice.  I don't really like the way she mixes different styles of music into the same CD.  I think it sounds way too much alike.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".
