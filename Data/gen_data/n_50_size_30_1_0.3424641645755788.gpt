Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I am a sucker for jazz and R&B; and I have a particular fondness for the smooth jazz that was popular in the late '90s.  I was very surprised to find this CD and have since purchased it.  This CD is the  best of the new and old jazz of the past two decades.  It is very well-balanced and has a very smooth feel to it.  The sax solos are superbly played and they are the highlight of the CD.  The tenor and baritone sax solos in particular are very impressive.  This is a must have.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

There are many different types of music, including music by other artists, that are included in this CD.  I have listened to this CD so many times, and I just love it.

The lyrics are very well written and they have a great amount of variety in them.  They are very easy to understand and they are very memorable.

This is my first time commenting on a post, so I hope I make sense. I have loved singing hymns for many years. I'm trying to find a good collection to play to my family, and I have tried to find the hymns that are sung, but I haven't had any luck. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!

My dad and I had a great time singing the following hymns in my home church. These are all old favorites. I do not have the names of the hymns we used, but some of them are:1. Amazing Grace2. Hallelujah3. One More Little Prayer4. Let the Church Be Joyful5. Amazing Grace6. Hallelujah7. One More Little Prayer8. Jesus Loves Me9. One More Little Prayer10. Jesus Loves Me11.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought this CD when he was still with the AOGR.  I heard him for the first time at a show in Richmond.  I had just made my way to a show at the Richmond Coliseum (which had a standing room only section) and decided to check out this local band called Revel.  I sat out in the front row, and as I listened to Revel the opening of "The Sound of a Woman's Voice" was the first thing that struck me.  It was a really good opening.  I didn't realize that this was a song that had been recorded by Hall and Oats, until I heard it on Revel.  I never bought the CD, but I'm glad I did, because I got to hear this terrific band, and really, the sound of the band was the best part of the CD, and it wasn't a huge production.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have liked the Hall and Oats' music since 1981.  I bought the CD last year, when they were with the AOGR.  I have just now bought the CD, and am really enjoying it.  I had it on my wish list for awhile.  I can't believe I had to wait until they got signed with their new label, which is so cool.  I'm not a big Hall & Oats fan (I'm not a fan of the band that I'm in) but I enjoyed this album.  The cd has a cool cover, and there is a great mix of music. I'm glad they made the band more visible.  I'm really glad there is a good song called "I Wanna Ride", by the way.               
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I have just recently  found and bought the CD, and I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised.  I have been a fan since the early 70's, but   I have not heard Hall & Oats' music since, and this is just the first cd I have listened to this year.   I have to say, it is very diverse, and some of the songs have not been heard before.  I will not be able to listen to the rest of the cd until the second cd is released. I am glad I found this cd, and  I will continue to buy it when it is released.   I can't believe how good it is.

Amazon review: It's a shame the man is dead, because his music has so many good things to say.  He sang in "The Band" which was great, he is from the 60's, but his music is so much better, and he was the lead singer in a band called Hall and Oats.

I think you're right.  I also think it's not about the song, but about the mood of the song.  It's a really good track, but it goes a little too far into the positive.
Here's the audio:

Here's the lyrics:

And if you’re looking for a song that’s positive, look no further.

Now I’m not going to lie, it’s not a “song” by a million miles, so this could be a bit of a stretch.  But it’s just a song.  It's not a very good song, but it's a song.  I like the lyrics, they're well written, and they're positive, but I just can't get into the song.  I'm not sure why.  I just can't get into it.  I wonder if it's because I didn't really like the song the first time around.
I think it's just not for me.  I've listened to it twice, and still, I can't get into it.  I just don't like the vibe.

Good song.  I like the music.  I'm not positive about this album.  I'm not a huge fan of the lyrics.  I don't really like the music.

A:

The author would like to apologize for the quality of the music he has chosen for the review.

"Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen
to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress
at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag."

The author's review of the CD is not very positive, what with the author's opinion and the fact that this is not a well written review.

Reviews on Amazon are almost always a little negative, but they do have a good reputation for their good quality.

My recommendation is to add it to your "to buy" list and wait for the next review.

I don't know why you would want to add something to your "to buy" list when there are many good reviews for it already.

I think I'll end my review here.

Thanks for listening.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a pretty decent group consisting of a 5 piece horn section, 3 bass players, and 2 rhythm section. The horn playing is pretty good with most of the instruments I've heard from these guys.  The rhythm section is pretty decent, especially the bass playing.  The horn section does sound like it came from the 70's, but it is not that bad.  The horns are what I remember hearing in a lot of early 70's bands (Dizzy Gillespie, Curtis Mayfield, The Allman Brothers).  The bass is pretty good but it could use a little more attack and some less bass notes when you really want to emphasize the bass.  The rhythm section could use a little more drive.  The drums are very solid and do not need much more drumming.  The bass needs a little more attack and the drums need a little more drive.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an all-star group! The horn section is superb and the bass is very good.  The drumming is very solid and would make a great funk/rock fusion band.  The vocalists are very good.  The horns are a little overbearing and the percussion is a little over the top.  For example, some of the percussion notes are so thick and heavy I could not really hear what was happening on the beat.  This band is not a lot to write home about but they are very good. If you like horns, you will probably enjoy these guys.  They are a little over the top but the vocalists are outstanding.

I'm just saying I'm not one of those people that can listen to a whole album and not be interested in the music videos.  I guess it just depends on how much you like the music.  I do like the music videos, but I will probably like the album more once I get to hear the next one.

Amazon review:  I was looking for something really different from the norm, something that was gonna touch my soul, something that would make me think, and I found it in Meghan Trainor.  This song is absolutely amazing. I can't put this song down.  I listened to it last night at midnight and I'm already up and at it again this morning.  It's such a beautiful song, and I love how she's able to sing with such emotion, and she hits those high notes that she does so well.  It's just so beautiful and meaningful.  I love it.  I'll be listening to this song for the rest of the day.  I don't know how she can write and sing such a powerful song.  I know I won't be able to stop singing this song.  I'm so excited to be able to listen to this song again. I love the song.  I love the lyrics.  I love the music.  I love the vocal performance.  I love the music video.  I love the band.  I love the album.  My favorite song of all time.  I love the song.  I love the lyrics.  I love this album.  This album is so beautiful.

I have been looking forward to this CD since I saw the title. I was hopeful for the music; I am a huge fan of your work. The album didn't disappoint.

I really want to listen to it again. I will continue to listen to it, but I was hoping for a nice quality song and album. This is not for me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is the first CD that I've purchased from Amazon.  I ordered from their Web site to save shipping and a little more money.  This was a mistake.  I was not happy when I received it.  I was very disappointed; I was not satisfied with this product at all.  There was a lot of noise and distortion, and the CD quality was not up to par.  I ordered the most expensive CD that I could find for my budget -- it was a single CD, not a set -- and was very disappointed by it.

Amazon review: I bought this CD from the CD department of Amazon.  I was really surprised to see that this was a CD.  The CD is a CD.  I ordered it on the Web site, and they sent it out by email.  I opened the CD, and it was very nice and thick.  I had a lot of trouble playing this CD, as it was very noisy.  I did not play this CD very often, but when I did, it was very noisy.  This CD is not a CD for every person, but for some people, it might be a good choice.  I will not buy this CD again, as I am very disappointed.  I will order the single CD that the disc contains, which is better, to replace this CD.  I will go back to Amazon, and buy the single CD that I ordered.  I will order it by the single CD.  I do not know why I feel that way, but it is what I feel.  I am a little upset that I cannot return this CD.  I am not a fan of CDs, but I do have to return this CD to Amazon.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I'm currently reading the book, "The Lost Chords of Robert Johnson."   I love reading history and music, and I love Robert Johnson.    I have always loved Robert Johnson.  I think I first heard his music on the radio in 1965.    I had just moved to the small town of Canton, Michigan, from Mississippi.   I was a part of the family band there.    We were playing there when my brother-in-law asked my father to send a record to Robert Johnson for me and my sister.    I have been listening to his music ever since.  I have bought many of his albums.  I recently bought the new CD, "It's Alright, Ma."  It is a great album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's been years since I've been able to afford to listen to music. I'm always looking for that perfect mix of songs. This album is my perfect mix. I always have one playlist that's filled with songs that I like, and this album is definitely in that category. With so many different artists on this album, I had to go with the one's I liked, and the songs on this album are perfect for me. I love the mix of different styles of music. I am a big fan of the folk genre, but I also like everything else that is out there. This album is just what I needed. It's a perfect mix of different types of songs.

This album was a huge surprise. Everyone thought I would hate this album, but I loved it until the very end of it. The songs were just perfect for me. I was disappointed when it ended because the last song I listened to was the one with the most "bombs" and it was sad. I'm glad that the album was over and that I could listen to another song. I really wanted to hear a few more songs. I am glad I was able to find this album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I've listened to most of the artists on this album but I have to say that the most influential person in my life was the sound of this record. The drums, the bass, the guitar, the organ, the piano and the strings. It was such a huge change for me. I felt like something new and different. I'm glad I bought this album because I believe that music is the best medicine for you and you have to buy it if you want it. This is the sound of the future.

Lyrics to "You're The Best Thing I Never Had" by Lin Manuel Miranda, from album Broadway: Lin Manuel Miranda (from Broadway)
I'm gonna need a new start,
Cause everybody I ever loved turned me out
I'm gonna need a new start,
And I want you to be the best thing I ever had,
And when I go to heaven,
I want you to be the best thing I ever had.
You're the best thing I never had.
I'm gonna need a new start,
Cause everybody I ever knew,
Changed me out.
I'm gonna need a new start,
And I want you, to be the best thing I ever had,
And when I go, to heaven,
I want you to be the best thing I ever, had.
You're the best thing, I never had.

You're the very best thing I never had
You're the very best thing I never had
You're the best thing I never had
You're the very best thing I never, had
You're the best thing I never had
You're the best thing I never had.

You're the very best thing I never, had
You're so very good to me
You're the very best thing I never had,
You're the very best thing I never had
You're the the very best thing I never, had
You're the very best thing I never had.
You're the best thing I never had
You're the very good to me
You're the very best thing I never had
You're the, you're the very best thing I never had
You're the very best
You're the best thing I never had
You're the very very best thing I never, had
You're the very best thing
You're the best thing!

You're the very best thing I never had
You're so very good to me
You're the very very best thing I never had
You're the very very best thing I should never have had
You're the very very best thing I never had
You're so very good to me (I've been good to you)
You're the very best thing I never had
You're the so very best thing I should never have had.
You're the best thing I never had
You're so very good to me.

You're the very best thing I never had
You are the very best thing I never had
You're the very best thing. I never had
You're the the very best thing I never had.
You're the best thing. I never had
You're the very best thing. I never, had
