Amazon review:  "The album is a great mix of music with great lyrics, but the band's musical skills are not what I expected. They can mix a decent rock song with a great love song very well. The lyrics are very weak and the music is not what I expected either. I really thought these guys could make a great rock band, but I guess what they do is a bit different."

Amazon review: "The People's Key" is a collection of songs, songs that I just can't get out of my head, songs that have stuck with me over the years. And the lyrics are pretty damn good as well. The musicianship is excellent, as is the production. I'm really glad I finally listened to it, and I recommend it to everyone. However, I will say that I'm not sure I enjoy the band as much as I did back in the day. Now, I'm not saying that it's bad, but I'm not sure I'm as passionate about them now."

Amazon review: "This is a great collection of songs and there are a lot of them. The band has a great sound and their musicianship is excellent. I would say that this collection is worth the listen but I wish the band had more songs like this in the future. It would be a good first or second album."

Amazon review: "To be honest I was never really a huge fan of Conor Oberst's music. Perhaps it was because I was never really a huge fan of his voice. However, when I stumbled across his album "The People's Key" this album completely changed my opinion of him. This album is a great mix of music with great lyrics, but the bandâ€™s musical skills are not what I expected. They can mix a decent rock songs with a great love song very well. The lyrics are very weak and thier music is not what I expected either. I really thought these guys could made a great rock band, but I guess what they do is a bit differnt. My favorite song from the album is the title track "The People's Key". The songs are all very strong and I really enjoyed listening to this album."

Amazon review:  "Well, you can't really say much about this album since it's only been out for a little over a month.  It's got a killer song written about a famous person, but I don't really dig it.  The guitar work in "Ain't Love Enough" is really weak and very uninspired.  I don't even think it would work on the radio.  The song "You Don't Know" is just a boring, predictable dud.  I'm pretty sure it was never recorded.  I like the song "What You Believe" which has a cool melody.  It's also a bit short.  It's a pretty good song though.  Overall, I'm not a big fan of this album.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a big fan of this album, but I'm not really a fan of this album."

Amazon review:  "I thought it was a good album, but I didn't think it was any good.  I think it was a little better than "The People's Key" but not much.  The lyrics are boring, and the music is weak.  There is no real emotion in any of the songs.  I don't know why they didn't do more with the concept or make it the main focus.  It's just another one of those albums that you would expect to be good, but it's not really good."

Amazon review:  Review of "Fever" by Conor Oberst
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "You know how it is, some bands are just one step ahead of the music scene, some bands are just another band on another side of the tracks, and some bands are just not even in the music scene at all?  Conor Oberst is one of the latter.  He has been around for a while but he's been in a very small band playing what he's been playing all these years--and now, he's just kind of there.  The people who have been around for awhile have a certain "it" going for them, and Conor is just kind of there.  He's a great lyricist, he's a great singer, he has a great band and he's just kind of there.  Conor's latest album, "Fever", is a good album, but it's not really what I expected.  I really thought that the album was going to be really heavy, really dark and heavy, but that's not what Conor's sound is like.  I thought that Conor would be able to find a way to create a sound that is really dark and heavy and that is really unique and that is definitely not the sound that Conor's sound has always been.  Conor's sound is really kind of simple, really mellow, really dark and really heavy and it is really not really what I expected at all.  I think that Conor's sound is kind of like what you'd expect from a band like The Dillinger Escape Plan.  Conor's sound is kind of like a band like The Dillinger Escape Plan, but he's kind of not a Dillinger Escape Plan and he's not a band like The Dillinger Escape Plan and he's not a band like any of the other bands that you'd expect him to be a part of.  Conor is kind of like a band that you'd expect to hear on the radio, kind of like what you'd expect to hear on the radio from a band like The Dillinger Escape Plan, but Conor's really not a Dillinger Escape Plan, he's not a band like The Dillinger Escape Plan, he's not a band like any of the other bands that you'd look forward to hearing on the radio, so I really wasn't expecting Conor's sound to be something that was really dark and really heavy and really unique.  Conor's sound is really kind of simple

Lifted is a great album, and I'm a big fan of Conor's work. His songs are always amazing and he has a great sound. I loved the
