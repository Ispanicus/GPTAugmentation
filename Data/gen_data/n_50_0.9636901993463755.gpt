Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This cd is a must have.  I bought it in 2002.   I have the first 10 songs, so far,  and will buy more.   But, I'm not going to stop listening to the CD.  I just wanted to post this because, well,  they're really good.  The first time I heard them,  I was in a club and they sounded so good.   I have been listening to them ever since.  I am not a jazz fan, so this is a great compliment to me.  I can't wait to see what the next release is.

Amazon review:  This is a really good record.  I bought it in 1991.  It's not the most famous band  but I would say that they're more popular than the Beatles for the amount of money they make.  They are just a great band.  I have been listening to them on the radio since I bought it.

I can't even tell you what this song is talking about.  The music is very unique and I love the sound.  I don't know if I'll be able to play it for my kids, but for now, they are going to listen to the album anyway.  I was hoping they would be excited about it.  I didn't want them to get bored.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album about 20 times, and it's still great.  I like the songs on this album.  It's very unique to listen to.  I like how different some of the songs are.  I'm surprised it's so different from Title because it really is.  I've only listened to Title a couple of times and I didn't really get what this album was talking about.  I mean Title is different, but this album is different.  The songs are different, the styles are different, and the genres are different.  I'm not really a fan of rap, but I'm not a fan of pop either.  When I listen to this album, the songs are very repetitive, but the repetition is part of the unique style of the songs.  The other thing that I don't like about this album is that it doesn't really have any new lyrics.  It has about 7 songs that have lyrics, and the rest are just the repetitive music.  The only good thing about this album is that it is a great party album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like this album!  I love how different the songs are.  It's nice to hear some music that's not from a pop or rap artist.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The Schubert Collection was made up of 2 CDs. One of the cd's has a number of Schubert pieces played by the very excellent pianist Peter Serkin who is probably one of the finest pianists I've heard in a long time. He plays the same pieces over and over which makes it easy to hear their beauty. The other cd is a collection of lieder and has a lot of Schubert pieces, of which the most memorable for me is the one by Johann Sebastian Bach called The Trout. Peter sings a beautiful version of this piece and it is worth the price of the Schubert CDs alone. The second cd is a collection of chamber music with chamber music pieces being played by the wonderful pianist, Mary Alice. I listened to a few pieces from this cd and they were all good. I will now go back and listen to the first cd, The Trout.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I love this album but I would have to say I was a little disappointed with the vocals on the 2nd and 3rd albums. The lead vocalist's voice is very pleasant but the raps are not very good. There are a few good moments in the second one but they are too few. In the 3rd album the raps are great and the vocals are very good. Also the album is very long with some really good songs but I think they may be too long for some people. It is very good but not really my thing.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album twice over the past 10 days. I think Twiztid has a good voice, but it is really not what I'm into.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this album is a total disappointment. I am a fan of Twiztid, but it is obvious that he does not know how to balance his talents, his production skills and his rapping talents. The album is full of mediocrity. From rapping to production, he does not seem to know how to use his assets to best advantage. I really hate that he thinks the whole world revolves around him. No one knows who he is. Even his friends don't know who he is. I wish I could say he is still alive but he is not. I'm sure the reason for this is because he is the most arrogant person that I've ever met.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not an Twiztid fan, and I am really sorry. I have listened to this album twice already and I love what he does, but there is just too much mediocrity.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a new band that we are following.  This group has a great sound and is very well produced.  The first CD was very interesting, great guitar work, great vocals, good tempo, great songs.  The second CD more of the same, with some new songs but not much new in the sound.  This record is a little more upbeat.  Overall I would rate this group at three stars.

Amazon review: If you like the Beatles and you like heavy rock and you like classic rock from the 1950s through the 1970s, then this is the CD for you.

This is a good album for the price.  I would rate this a good album for the price.

Amazon review: This is another new release and I wasn't sure about it.  I guess that's why they called it "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" album.  I have heard plenty of albums with the same name, so I was really surprised at how good this album was.  I have to admit, it's not my favorite record (It's number one on the "Best of" list, but I haven't listened to it for a while) but I like it.  The songs are all different and I like most of the songs, the only ones I don't like are the last two songs.  The album is well produced and the sound is good, but I don't like the two songs with the voices.  I am not really a fan of voice on voice on voice, and I don't like it on this album.  The good songs include "Kiss Me Goodbye," "Silly Lullaby" and "I'm So Happy."  The bad songs include "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and "She's Leaving Home."  The Ugly songs are the ones I didn't like the most.  The rest of the songs are good.  This is a good album.  I would rate this a good album for the $15 price.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have purchased after having a year since I bought my last CD.  The CD is very good.  The CD has a great sound and is very well produced.  The song "For The Love Of" is the one that has the best guitar playing I have seen in a while.  This is a good album for the price.  I would like to see the new CD, but only because I have been waiting so long for a new album.  My favorite songs are "I Can't Help Falling In Love" and "For The Love Of."  I like the new songs and the older songs.  This is a good album for the price.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This album is a great example of what it means to be a professional record producer.  The lyrics are great and the music is amazing.

Amazon review: The first thing that drew me to this album was the lyrics on the first track "Dance of the Dead".  I really enjoy your music and I'm glad that I am finally able to try some of your music.  I'm sorry for the bad review I have to make some things right. First of all, I am not a huge fan of the music of this album.  It is not a bad album, I just don't like it.  That said, I don't think that the song "Dance of the Dead" is that bad as I thought it was, it's just not my cup of tea.  I wouldn't consider it a bad album because of it, but I was disappointed.  Secondly, the second track "Black Dog" is just a song that I really didn't like and the third, "Grim Reaper", I found to be very, very boring.  I don't know where you get your music, but I think that your music is a bit overrated.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of your music since I first heard "The Sound in the Room" in '91.  I have been listening to a lot of your music since then but this is my first time buying your album.  I am really enjoying it.  I know that you have said many times that you're not a  big fan of the music you've produced, but this album is a bit overrated.  To me, it sounds like a bunch of random songs that were randomly put together.  I don't think that your songs are that good.  They're not bad, but I don't think that they're that good either.  Like I said, I like the music, but I don't like it enough to buy it.  It's not a bad album but I don't think that it's worth the money that I spent on it.  I know that you've said many times that you don't have many fans, but I've never heard anything that I've liked as much as this album.  I would recommend that you try producing another album before you say that you don't like the music that you've produced.  When I saw the album cover, I thought that it would be something cool to listen to, but I wasn't able to listen to any of the songs.  I don't know why, but I think that the songs on this album are not that good.  The only good thing about the album is that it has a lot of great songs.  I don't think that any of the songs could be called "great" but they're all great songs.  I don't understand why you don't release any songs that are better than the songs on this album.  I think that you'll be able to produce another great song.  I'm sorry that I never liked the music on this album.  I'm glad that I'm finally able to listen to it.  I hope that you'll release another album soon.  I think that this album is my favorite album of all time.  I hope that you'll release another great album soon.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Dallas Holm and The Nuns of St. Joseph for years and years now.  This is my second time listening to the music of these two great acts. I loved The Nuns of St. Joseph's music so much that I bought their new album, In Christ We Sing. But, this album is not the same as their previous album, The Best of Dallas Holm.  It is a live album of songs from their concerts. There are no studio sound added. I have listened to it over and over and over again.  I was blown away by how much I loved this album. I loved the songs that I had heard before, but the new songs were different and I liked them a lot. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves live music and especially to anyone who likes Dallas Holm and The Nuns of St. Joseph.

The album was produced by Phil Collins, and features contributions from a number of his previous band mates. Whilst some may think his voice sounds like he is singing in a vacuum, it's a testament to his talents that he is able to create such distinctive, powerful, and emotionally resonant vocals that are easily identifiable even on the recordings. Of course, the most important thing with this album, and with his voice in general, is that they are always in perfect sync. No matter where Phil is on a record, or how long he is singing, there is always a perfect blend of his voice that is perfect for the song and the music.

This album is a lot of Phil singing in a vacuum. The fact that he is singing in a vacuum is a testament to the fact that he is a master at his craft, and an amazing recording artist. I think one of the reasons his voice sounds so distinctive is that he always sings with his full range, even when he is singing in a vacuum, but it's not just his voice that is distinctive, but also his lyrics. Phil is never afraid to tell the truth, and he always tells it with a lyrical sophistication that takes the listener to a place of emotional satisfaction.

Phil's greatest strength is his ability to tell a story with his lyrics, and that is one of his greatest weaknesses. He can get lost in his words, and the words have meaning, but it's not until he reveals the story behind the lyrics that the listener truly understands what the lyrics are about. Phil is able to do this because he knows the stories he wants to tell, and he is able to draw the listener into a world of emotion and imagination.

This is why I love listening to this album. It is so much more than just a collection of songs. This is a testament to Phil's ability to tell a story with his lyrics. It's also a testament to his ability to create an emotive, compelling, and captivating performance.

In the past, Phil has given us some great albums like AI, and he has given us good albums like AI 2006/2007. This album is no different. It is a solid album, and it is a great album. It is a great album, and it is a good album.

Phil had a lot of great albums in the past, and this one is no different. It's just a great album, and it's a good album. It's not a great album, and it's not a good album. It's just a great album, and it's a good album, and it's an okay album, and it's an okay album, and it's an okay good album, and it's an okay okay album, and it's an okay okay excellent album, and it's an okay okay excellent album, and it's a good album, and it's a good album, and it's a good good album, and it's a good ok good album, and it's a good good good album, and it's a good good good album, and it is a good good good album, and it's a good good good good album, and it's a good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good album that is, and it's a good good good good good good good good good ok good album that is, and it's a good good good good good ok album that is, and it's a good good good good ok album that is, and it's a good ok good album that is, and it's a good good good ok album that is

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are the person who is going to read this article, I have to say, I don't like how this album is recorded at all.  It's just all too generic, and like the lyrics are made by a 14 year old that doesn't know how to write lyrics.  It's really disappointing.  I give it 5 stars because the songs are really good and I like the idea of the album.  However, I don't think it will get much airplay.  I suppose you can enjoy it on your computer, but I don't recommend it.  I guess he's just trying to make up for AI 2006/7.  I do like the fact that he's making a new album, but it's sad that this album is just so generic.  They should at least try to write a new song for Thalia's voice.  
I think the most annoying thing about this album is how they put out so many songs that I don't like.  And it's the same with the whole album.  I'm not even sure how they wrote this "Thalia" character.  It's just some random name.  I'm not even sure if it's a real person or just a character.  I don't think he should be singing, but I do like that he sings and his voice is good enough to sing.  But, it's just too generic to be an artist.

Amazon review: I was on the fence about this one, but I ended up giving this one 5 stars.  It's just the same generic AI, but I like the songs and I do like the idea of the album.  I think it would be good to make Thalia sing one song, because it's really boring to hear her all the songs.  But, I do like the album.  The only bad thing about this album is the fact that they have 5 songs that I don't know and I don't really like.  It just seems like AI's last album.  I think this album would get more airplay if AI sang one more song.  I guess he's just trying to make up for AI 2006.  I do like the idea of this album, but the songs are just too generic.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So, AI is a bit of a disappointment.  I wasn't really excited about AI.  I liked his earlier albums, but I didn't really like this one.  It was just very generic.

It's not really AI, but I hate AI, but I wish he'd release a new album with more songs.  It would be better than this boring old AI.  So, AI is a bit of a disappointment.  If you were expecting a new AI album, you're not going to be disappointed.  It's just the same old AI.  I don't know why he's trying to make up for 2006, but it's just a waste of his talent.  I really don't like AI, but I wish he'd release a new album with more songs and a new AI.  It would be better than this boring old AI.

I've found that the best way to learn music is to make a recording of yourself and play it back to yourself. You can then play it again and again. This is great for listening to the music and learning

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

The lyrics are horrible, the music is horrible, the vocals are horrible, and the production is horrible.  This album is complete garbage.

Amazon review: I am a singer and I am sure that the sound of her voice is unique, but the words are all over the place.  I have a feeling that I will be singing to a lot of people whose first language is not English.  I should be used to it; I have had to learn more than a few languages.  But anyway, I really like this CD.  I like the lyrics and the way she says them.  But the music is all over the place.  I think it is because she is not being very creative.  She is singing too high over a low note.  I like the arrangement and it is very simple.  Maybe she could just give herself a few more lessons?  I like the simple arrangements and the way she sings.  I am sure she could work on her technique.  But I think it is the lack of originality that keeps me from giving her this five stars.  She is so much better in her role as a singer in the movie "Sisters."  The songs are good and the lyrics are not over the top.  I would really like to learn her real name so I can thank her for her generosity.  I really like the music and the arrangements.  I am not sure if I am supposed to like the way she says the lyrics.

I wish I could give her a five star rating.  She is so much better in her role in the movie "Sisters."  The songs are good.  So is the sound of her voice.

I don't know if she is supposed to be singing at all.  I do not know how she can sing so high over a note.  I wish she would tone down her voice because she sounds way too high over a note.
