Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Now I cannot load the song onto any Android or tablet phone I have. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too inelegant to make any sense as to how they are going to provide the songs to their customers. It is a great song but you really have to pay your Amazon music fees to get it to load.

Amazon review: I love this song because of the opening statement.  "My heart tells me that I'll never know until I find out for myself."  I feel like a little kid again as I listen to it.  I am so lucky to have such a wonderful friend who knows me so well.  She is like my other half.  I love hearing her voice and hearing her sing.  I know I can trust her with my heart.  I love the lyrics, too.  I was born on the Fourth of July and it's a day I can't wait to celebrate.  I love the idea behind the song.  I have always held that I would be married when I was 40 years old.  I knew I would be married before I turned 40.  I love it when I hear her sing...I feel like she is my other half.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon reviews: I bought this song at the beginning of the season. I was excited because I just bought a new pair of earbuds. I am happy now that I waited. The beat is good, but I don't like the lyrics. They are very inappropriate for a song like this. I have only given 1 star because I will not buy it again.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

The best musical moments are, in my opinion, "Just Like a Pill," "I Can't Stand Losing You," "Just Like a Pill," "I Can't Stand Losing You (Reprise)," and "I Don't Want To Be (On This Side of the Bed)." I don't know why I have such a hard time with "The Sun is Also a Star" and "I Don't Want To Be (On This Side of the bed). I think the song is good, but I don't like it as much as most fans do. The songs that I do like are "I Don't Want To Be (In This World)," "I Can't Stand Losing You," and "Just Like a Pill." I also like "The Boy I Once Knew," "The Boy I Once Knew (Reprise)," and "I Can't Stand Losing You (Reprise)." The album is all over the place. I like that. The songs are great, but I don't know if I would put this album on my "classic" list.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I will admit that I am a bit of a Pink fan.  I will admit that I am a bit of a Pink fan.  Pink is one of the great singer-songwriters of our time.  She can sing almost anything, and she really has something to say.  The only problem with Pink is that she is often so inconsistent with her lyrics and performances.  I don't know why she's so inconsistent.  What she does so well is to write songs that are filled with a sense of humor and personal sentiment and are really quite moving.  Her songs touch me and make me cry. She is always there for me.  I find that with Pink, you can sometimes hear her inner monologue as she writes the words and the music itself.  She always makes me feel.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: This is a great collection of songs by the new and emerging singer, Kaelani. She actually recorded her songs with an orchestra which is nice to hear live. She sings in her own style. The songs are great, but the album is very short and has some really bad songs. The singers can sing, and the harmonies are good. The only thing I don't like is the intro, which I think was a mistake.

Amazon review: This album has so many good songs, not just one.  The song 'Mama Loves You' has been a favourite of ours. It's very strong and makes the most out of what is in the arrangement. There is lots of variety to listen to on the album.

Amazon review (preview):  I've been a fan of Kaelani since I first heard "The Good Enough" on the soundtrack of the animated movie, "Babar."  I just love her sound.  The album has a lot of good songs and she's written some very good songs.  I really like the way she sings.  I'm not sure what it's about, but I can tell you that I've never heard a singer with as much ability as she has.  I think her voice is great and she has great musicianship.  I really hope she gets a chance to do more shows with the orchestra.

Amazon review (preview) (I was not a fan until I saw her live on the stage, I was in awe, this is amazing):  I saw Kaelani perform live.  She has a very powerful voice and very good musicianship.  Her voice is a lot more powerful than expected.  I was surprised at how much power it had.  She sang very beautifully and was very powerful.  She was singing to a full orchestra of musicians, some of them were also singing as well.  This is a very powerful performance by Kaelani.
