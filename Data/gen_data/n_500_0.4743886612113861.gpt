Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I think that this disc is a better representation of the original material than the first disc.  The first disc is definitely a more "straight up" version of the original disc.  The second disc is a more hip-hop version of the original material.  This version is much better quality.  It's a little over an hour long.  The original version lasts about an hour and a half.

Amazon review: I liked the first disc. I thought it was a good representation of the original material.  It contained a lot of good cuts.  The second disc was a little disappointing.  The first disc had 5 great songs.  The second disc had 2 songs.  That was disappointing.  The first disc also included a song with a great title, "It's a Trap."  This song was pretty fun.  The second disc was a typical "gangsta rap" song.  It didn't have any of the style that the first disc had.  The second disc was similar to a lot of rap metal bands and was very boring.  I would rather listen to a rap metal band then this disc.

It just sounds like the original material.  The songs are good, but the quality of the original songs is better than the new song.  If you want a better version of the original songs, I would recommend the first disc.  This disc is just a re-recording.  I mean, it's not even the same song.  It's just a re-recording of the same song.  This disc is not something that you should have.  I would say the second disc is better than the first disc.

Amazon review: This is not a good album. I have never seen the video so I will just let that one slide.  I don't even like Queen.  I will tell you what I don't like about this album.  These lyrics are so bad that the band doesn't even have to sing them.  They just play them on a loop and sing them.  When they sing them, they just give the impression that they are singing them from the other side of a wall.  Also, the lyrics are just horrible.  I can't even imagine what the real lyrics would be and I'm sure they would be worse than the ones on this album.  I don't even understand what the song is about.  I would rather hear something that was good.  I would rather listen to a good song than listen to an album that has no good songs.

Amazon review: It's not terrible, but it's not much to write home about.  I don't even know what the meaning of the lyrics are.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The first 3 or 4 tracks are OK, but not my favorite.  The rest are not my cup of tea.  The album is good, but not good enough to recommend.  I only had a few good songs.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album twice a day since the day I found it.  I've listened to a lot of music and I've liked most of what I've heard, but this album has made me feel like I was listening to the album.  The tracks seem to go back and forth between new and old.  I think this album is great, but for it to be worth listening to, I think it would be good to listen to in between songs so that the songs would just be as good as the songs before them.  I didn't know so many songs were recorded and mixed at the same time.  I think this can benefit from many listens.  I could definitely listen to it again and again.  I think it would be good for a CD with all the artists on it.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review:  This was a very pleasant surprise. Not to be confused with the original by Bing Crosby, this version is completely different; it's not as popular as the original recording and is much more of a light-hearted tune.  The lyrics are a little more generic as to the woman who is singing and not as specific as the original.  However, the song itself is just as lovely.  I'm very glad I found this version on Amazon.com.  It's my new favorite!  It's a "must have."

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
