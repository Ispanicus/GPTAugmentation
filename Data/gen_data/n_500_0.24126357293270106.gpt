Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I don't know.  Not sure if I should be impressed or discouraged with the album.  Maybe I am just a sucker for a good pop song?  I mean if you can get a good pop song, then you at least have a good pop song.  But here you get a bunch of mediocre songs.  How do you get songs like "All I Need" from a band that can't even play a decent pop song?  "Lovin' You" is a pretty weak song.  Not that I want to hear a song from a band that can't even play a decent pop song, but I just can't get past this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't even know that this was a band that had the ability to make a good pop song, but I'm glad I checked it out.  It's a decent song.  Probably a bit too repetitive but hey it's a decent song.  I get the feeling that there is a lot more potential in this band.  I think they have some great music in them but I will stick to their hardcore stuff.  It's still the best hardcore band in the country.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What a waste of time.  Good songs?  Yeah.  Good music?  No.  I can't understand why this band has been around for so long and no one has ever caught on to this band.  They need a good pop song and a good hardcore song.  I get it.  Most bands don't need a good pop song.  I guess it's not a bad thing but it doesn't make for a good album.  I'm not really sure what the problem is with this band.  Maybe it's a good thing I got the album for free. 
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It is more accessible than its predecessor.  There is a lot more variety in this album.  It's a better deal for the listener.  I think the band put out some good songs.  I just wish there was some more variety in the music.  I'm glad I found this album.  I don't think it's worth the price of admission.  It's not a bad album.  It's just a different album from its predecessor.  I would recommend this album to some people who like heavy music but not so much that they will need to have a "rock" band album.  But it is good.

Amazon review: This is a good album.  It's got some great songs.  The problem is that it's kind of average.  There are a lot of good songs but I think the album could have been better.  You would think that a band like this would have more variety.  They are a pretty good band and they are always putting out great albums.  They are probably the best heavy band in the country.  They just need to find a good pop song.  I don't know how else to explain this except that they can't really write good pop songs.  They just go with whatever they have to write a good pop song.  I don't know what it is about this band.  It's not a bad album.  I think it's a good album.  It's just not the band's best work.

I like the way they stand up for what they believe in.  They have a good attitude.  They are great guys.  That's how I feel about this band.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I have been a Perry fan for years.  This album is not worth the money I paid for it.  The songs are terrible.  I have listened to this album more times than I can count.  I actually bought this album because of the song, "When I Think Of You".  I have never ever heard this song before.  It was the first song on the album.  I was excited to see what the album had to offer, especially since the artist was Perry.  I was not disappointed.  The rest of the songs were just as disappointing.  I would not buy this album again.  It is not worth the money I paid for it.

Amazon review: This is an interesting album.  There are some good songs on this album.  There are also a lot of bad songs.  I love Perry's vocals, and I would like to continue to listen to her albums, but I really do not enjoy this album.  I am disappointed because I have already spent $15.00 on the album, and I was hoping for more.  This album leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Amazon review: It was okay.  You really have to hear it at least 20 times before you can say it is good.  The songs are all so bad.  I do not like Katy Perry, but this album is one of the best albums she has put out in her career.  If you go to the official page, you can buy it for $15.00.  It is a good album.  I will still buy it.  I have actually purchased several albums because of this one.  I have been a Perry fan for years.  This is the reason why I bought this album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

This album is my favourite so far I like the vocals and the instruments and the whole thing, I love the new style of the band. I like the sound of the guitar and the drums, and the bass, i like the way they mix instruments. I like the way they mix the different

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Nothing of great interest.  Mostly a vanity project. Quite disappointing, really.

Amazon review: This is a really weird cd.  I love the title, but the cd is a real mess.  There are a lot of "songs" with no clear meaning, and the lyrics are completely vague and indecipherable.  I can't tell if this is a children's album or just a cd with no real music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album, but I'm not sure it's worth the money.  I like the music, but I'm not sure I want to buy the cd.  I could've bought the cd for my brother, who loves everything by the Jonas Brothers, but I have a feeling this cd will only be played at his house.  I think the music is good, but I don't think this is worth $8.99.

Amazon review: I thought this was going to be great.  It really didn't do anything for me.  I think it's alright, but it's not a "must have" type of cd.  It has one original song on it, so maybe it's not bad.  I don't think I'll buy it.  I really don't know what to think of this cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This cd is good.  It's just one song on the cd.  I'm not really getting much out of this cd.  They sing a song, it's repetitive and it's just one song.  I'm pretty sure it's just a single.  I'd like to hear other songs, but I'm not really expecting any.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because it was going on sale for a few weeks. I thought it'd be a good deal since it was on sale, but when I tried to listen to it, I just couldn't get into it.  This cd was a let down.

###
Amazon review: This was a good idea, but it's no good.  Not a single song, just a bunch of random songs that no one wants to hear.  The songs are all over the place and most of them sound like they were made for a band called the Jonas Brothers.  They have a good idea for some of the songs, but most of the songs are very boring and just a bunch of generic songs.  I'd like to know what they're singing about.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best song on the cd by far.  The lyrics are amazing and they all sound like they're from a totally different band.  The lyrics of the songs are amazing and they could have easily been written by a different group of people.  I love the vocals, but unfortunately the songs are boring and generic.  I hope they release a new cd soon and they change their name to something new.  I would buy this cd, but I'm sure I'll never know what it is or how great it is.

Amazon review: This is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  This is a very good song.  I don't think anyone will disagree with me.  Not a single song on the cd is bad.  The lyrics are amazing and the song is very memorable.

###
Amazon review: This song was amazing.  From the first time I heard this song, it was like "aw, I'm going to love this song."  The vocals and the sound are so good, it was hard for me to even put it down.  I think this song could be in a "greatest hits" compilation, because it could be used in any situation.  I love the sound and the lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The way the music is arranged is very interesting.  The first song is very quiet, but then the sound changes to a soft, almost peaceful tone, and then it turns into a very loud sound.  It's interesting to listen to, but I don't think I'm going to buy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's funny how sometimes when you hear songs you really like, you can't help but think "I wonder who this song is about?"  This song is about a guy who is very jealous of his girlfriend.  The song is very sad and it's sad to listen to.  I'm not really sure why I liked this song so much, but I did, but just because it's sad doesn't mean I like it.  I think it's just because it's a very beautiful song and it's very sad.  There's no reason to buy it.  It's just sad.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I love this song, it is one of the most beautiful songs from the 80's and there is not a better way to start a day! It is a very sad song, but the lyrics are so beautiful and the music is amazing. I love this song and hope that its popularity will grow.

Not sure what's going on here; maybe someone else can find something, but here's the track's Wikipedia page.

 I used to be a member of a band that used to play this song and we used to have a lot of fun playing it in the studio. The songs were then released on cassette as "Jams" which I thought was the coolest name for a band name.

I was able to find a link to a review of the song on a website. It was written by a listener, not on the website itself. The review was written in 2009 and I haven't read it in years.

 The review is here: http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/15/rock-n-roll-movies-josh-reynolds-lullaby-the-star-wars-of-the-nights-end-review

I would like to point out, however, that

 The review did not mention that the song was recorded by him.

 The review reads as follows:

"Lullaby in the Stars is a nice, but underwhelming choice. You want songs that are going to make you think, and this one doesn't quite get that.

But it's not a total waste of time, because I like it, and I like it a lot.

I like the song's guitar-based riff, and the lyrics are sweet. I'm thinking of buying the remastered version, but I'm not really sure I'll listen to it too much.

The vocal harmonies are fine and the chorus is pretty.

It's a good song, but it's an unremarkable one."

 It seems that the reviewer's assessment of the song's quality went somewhat beyond his expectations.

 I hope that its popularity will grow.

 The reviewer's comment seems to suggest that the song is not a good choice as an end-of-the-year song.

 I am not sure that my review of the song is sufficient for the review.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "You can't be in a metal band and not write about drugs."  It's not a bad thing that "Destro" is a bit of a rip-off of the entire "I Am the Man" album, but the fact that they have decided to copy a drug song is a horrible idea.  The song is very much in the style of the best heavy metal of all time, but it doesn't flow in the way that classic metal songs do.  It does what it says, but it doesn't do it very well.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
