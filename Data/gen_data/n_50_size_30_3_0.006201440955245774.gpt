Amazon review: Oh, wow, I love this song. I am not a fan of country music (I am a rock guy), but this song is just amazing. It is a perfect combination of country and rock. It is also, for me, the song that captures the emotion, which it's hard to capture in a genre that is usually too over the top, but this song really does it. You really feel the angst, the hurt, the anger, the pain, the anger, the grief, the jealousy, and the joy. A great song, a great album, and a great listen, all rolled into one.

Nothing that would make me say "I like this song!"  The lyrics are very good.  But no lyrics.  They are good.  They are just generic lyrics that say something.  The song is good, but it's not unique or special.  The instrumentation is good, but it's not very deep.  The vocals are good, but the production is bad.  The vocals are a little too high pitched, but that could be my fault.  But other than that, the sound is awesome.  The sound quality is great.  My only complaint is the instrumentation.  It sounds very simple.  However, it's a good basic sound that has a lot of great instrumentation.  The production is good, but not as good as it could be.  I would like to hear a little more from this artist.  I am a little dissapointed that I did not get to listen to more.  I would have liked to hear more, in other genres.  I would have liked to listen to a little more of his originals.  I would have liked to listen to more of his other stuff that he did not put on this disc.  I would have liked to hear more of his stuff, but I was not expecting much.  However, I guess I will have to settle for the songs that I did get.  I love his music.  I just wished that there would be more of it.

Amazon review: He is not a very good singer.  He is a very good singer, however, he cannot sing very well.  His voice is very ordinary.  He does not sing in an unusual way.  He is very generic.  His style is very boring.  He is not very creative.  He is not very interesting.  He is very dull.  His voice and style are not very unique.  His lyrics are very dull, generic and boring.  I do not know why he put this CD out.  But there is nothing on this CD that I like.  There is nothing that would make me say that I like this CD.  His instrumentation is very average.  The production is not very good.  He does not produce the instruments very well.  It sounds very simple.  I would like to hear more.  I do not even know if he should have put this CD out at all.  He should have put it out when he had a little more time to put more on it.  He should have put it out when he had a little more talent and had a little more energy.  His lyrics are not very good.  He does not have a very good voice.  His music is very boring.  He does not sound like someone who has a lot of talent.  The lyrics are very dull, generic and boring.  He is not very creative.  His music is not very original.  His instruments are very average.  He does not have a very unique sound.  He is not very artistic.  He does not sing in an unusual way.  He is not very creative.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album made me so angry that I almost made a purchase out of spite.  The album is really good, but the lyrics are so dark and depressing that it makes it hard to listen to.  If you're looking for an album to listen to from early 2000's to present that's good, this isn't it.  This album is like a bad ass bitch slapping you in the face and telling you to "get a life"   I'm not a fan of Eminem's voice, but I do like his lyrics and the way he's able to be able to write about things that you would never ever hear in the rap world. In the end I think he's a really awesome rapper and an even better lyricist.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I really enjoy many of the songs on this album.  I'm not surprised by how much I like this album, since it is so different from what was expected at first.  The album as a whole is what I would call a "lame duck" release so I won't even comment on anything that came out after this.  However, I will say that this album is very good and has some really nice songs.  I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about this artist.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't see how you can go wrong with this album, the lyrics are so meaningful and so creative.  I think a lot of the songs are "epics".  The song, "Rude Awakening" is a good example of a song I can listen to over and over again.  This album is definitely worth checking out.

Amazon review: I haven't been this excited about an album in a long time.  The last album I purchased was "The Eminem Show" and I didn't really like it.  This album is definitely more mature, but it has some great songs.  I can't wait to listen more.

Amazon review: I can't say I have been a fan of Em since his first album.  I have to say that I really enjoy this album, most likely because I have not listened to one of his albums in over a year.

I can listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: I love his voice/look and I'm excited to listen to his album.  However, I can see why this album was not a huge hit.  It was just too different from his previous albums.  I do enjoy the album and his voice is really good.  I was disappointed that they didn't do a sequel to this album or a compilation of his old albums.  This album is a good one.  It's a little more mature and a little less pop, but it's also great.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the first two albums by the band.  I'm glad that they are returning with a new album.  This album is not great, but it is pretty solid.

The lyrics have been recorded many times, and include such as:

Lover, lover, lover,
Come to my arms, my lover, my lover.

Amazon review: My wife bought the cd and put it on the stereo in the car.  It always makes me feel good when she sings along with the cd.  It makes me feel proud that she is a Christian.  It makes me feel like a good husband.  I would like to buy the cd on my own but I don't want to be disrespectful.  I will tell her that she is a great Christian and a great wife.  I am going to give her this cd in the mail tomorrow.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Oh my god this is awful.  This guy is so awful at what he does that I really don't want to listen to this album. The song's sound and production are so bad that I don't think anyone will ever listen to this again.  It is just so bad.  I don't know what's wrong with it, but it's a waste of my time.  Please don't make any more of these albums because they all suck.

Amazon review: I was looking for a new party/rave/dance/hip hop album and this is what I found.  I am not into this genre of music and I don't understand why the hype that the artist's are putting out.  This is the worst album I have ever heard that I would buy.  I will not buy it again.  I was not into the song's sound but then I will not buy any music from this artist.  He definitely has talent but this is the worst album I have ever heard.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: Liked the first few songs but then realized the album was boring and uninteresting.  The producer and arranger seem to be stuck in the same groove for the entire album which is what makes the album sound so bad.  I do like some of the tracks but it was just too hard a listen.  The album is hard to listen to and I don't think I will be buying it again.

Amazon review: I was a bit disappointed when I first heard this album.  I thought the album was ok but not great.

They are very good songs and I do hope they get more recognition

Amazon review: I like this song.  I am not a big fan of the genre.  This is the beginning of a new era in rap music but it's not really hip hop.

I will continue to purchase this album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have the original CD.  I own it.  It is beautiful.  I have listened to it over 100 times since I bought it.  This CD was created to reflect the lives of the three musicians who created this CD.  If you are looking for the CD that came out in 2004, then it is not for you.  I loved the CD and wish that this CD was still being made.  I have been a fan of these three musicians for over 10 years.  They are my friends.  They are my musical heroes.  I don't know how I've lived without them.  For that reason, I have purchased the CD so that I may have a permanent record of what the real people are like.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: So this is the CD I bought this morning for the purpose of listening to it over and over and over again. I must admit that I have been listening to a lot of music of the pop variety lately. I thought that I would listen to some of the oldies like this one. I was quite surprised when I opened the CD to find that it was Jewel's newest CD (I just started listening to her from the first time I heard her). I don't know. I just didn't like it. I was expecting a pop song for some reason. I was expecting a lot of people to be singing along with the lyrics. I mean, it was pretty simple--like most pop songs are. I don't know. I just didn't like it. I think that it was one of those CDs that I would not buy again and would not recommend. I don't know. I just didn't like it.

My only other comment about this CD would be that it does sound a little bit like Jewel is singing on a TV show. I don't know. I don't know what it is.

Amazon review: I heard this song in an old Whitney Houston video, and I thought it was ok.  I thought I'd have to buy this album to hear the rest of her hits, but it takes a little bit of work to find.  So, I gave it a 2 and will wait for the rest of her stuff to come out.

Amazon review: I found this song by accident, and it's ok.  The song "Marry Me" is really good, and it's probably going to be on some new Meghan Trainor album.  I just liked the sound and thought it was ok.  As far as the rest of the album goes, it was average.  I wish there was a few more songs that I liked.  As far as listening to them, I'm going to have to give it 2 stars.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I actually bought this album thinking it was going to be different, but as many of you have said it is the same music and song. I think there is a lot of hype and a lot of the people who buy these albums are so excited to get a record that they don't really understand.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a nice album, but I don't know what to think about it. Just let me listen.  I'm not going to buy it because I already have a lot of the LMM music. I will also not buy any of her music, because I don't see any reason for an album of songs that have a lot of repeats. This album is going to be good for some people, but not me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because I thought it was going to be an album, but it turned out to be a compilation of songs from LMM's older albums. I don't want to hear any of LMM's other music. I want to hear the new music that is coming out right now. I have a lot of LMM's older albums, not this compilation.

Amazon review: This album is OK, but it's another example of how the same songs play over and over. Most of the songs that I can actually remember are from the first half of the album. Once I got into the second half I stopped listening to the rest. I'm sure this is not the first album that you've listened to that you've heard the same songs over and over.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another CD compilation.  I like the songs on this CD, but I am still not sure if I will purchase it. The songs just don't hold my interest enough for me to spend my money on it, though, so maybe it will be just another one of the many CD compilations that I have purchased over the past few years. Just not sure if I will get it or not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this CD.  I like the songs on it, but the lyrics aren't for me.  They're very much about the subject matter, and I don't want to hear about the subject matter.  I would rather hear about the musical styles that the songs are from and the story lines that the songs are about.  I like the concept of the album, but the songs are just so repetative that I just can't get into them.  I guess I'll just have to wait for Meghan Trainor's next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the last CD from Meghan Trainor, but it's also the last album that I will get from her.  I have been buying LMM's discs for the past four, five years, so I guess I have been with Meghan since they started recording (and I like most of her albums).  I have bought several of Meghan's albums, but none of them were as good as her last one.  I don't see why this album will make me change my mind about her, but as I just mentioned, I will probably wait for her next album to come out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought her last album in December and have been listening to it every since.  I think that this album is the best one she's ever released.  Her talent is unbelievable.  She can write a song and make it so good that you can't help but listen to it.  I think she's one of the best singers and musicians to ever be alive.  I can't believe how fast her popularity has grown.  I wish that she would have made more albums more often, because it would have been so much better for her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is definitely not a CD that I would buy.  The songs are pretty good, but I just don't have the time to listen to them.  I don't like the music style, or the lyrics.  I don't even really like the music style on this album.  The songs are just so repetitive, and I don't feel like I'm really listening to the songs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

My husband, who is a huge fan, said she should be on his radio show.

Amazon review:  I have never been one to get into the whole "I like you girl" thing.  I like to say I like all kinds of girls, but I am not into the whole "I like you girl" thing.  I like girls that are outgoing, that don't go all shy and scared around me.  I like girls that have a good heart and are willing to help others.  A girl that will go out of her way to help me.  A girl that doesn't take things so personally and will listen when I say something isn't right.  It never crossed my mind that a girl like this might feel differently about me.  I saw her at a concert, and I thought she was great.  She was very beautiful, she had a really big smile and she sang like her heart was in her throat.  The other two girls on the tour didn't have the same type of vocals. Jewel's vocals were not that different from the other two.  Jewel is a very humble woman and I think she would not have taken me wrong. I feel that people who judge her are only making themselves look stupid.  I have never felt that she was anything other than a good person.  I know that she has a lot of talent, and I know that she's a very nice person.  I know she's not perfect, but I know that she's a good girl.  I know that she has a lot of problems, but I know that she's a good person.  I know that she loves her family, and she loves her friends.  I know that she is a good person.  I know that she has a strong relationship with God, and that she has a strong relationship with her church.  I know that her parents raised her to be a good person, and they raised her to be a wonderful Christian woman.  There is no need for her to be judged.  All of that will be put on her.  What she does on stage is her own business.  What she does offstage is her own business.  I know that she is a good person, and that she does what she does because she loves it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't speak for others, but I'm a fan of the late Jewel.  I love her music and her voice.  I feel that she is a very talented woman and that if you don't like her, that's fine.  I love all of her songs, and I like all of her singers.  I feel that she has a beautiful voice, and I feel that she is a very talented woman.  Sometimes she seems a little off, but I really don't know why.  She may be depressed, but I really don't think that she is.  I really don't know why she sings the way that she does.  I feel that she will be fine.  I feel that she is very humble.  She loves her God and I feel that she loves her fans, and I feel that she cares.  She is a very sweet woman.  I feel that people need to be who they are.  Sometimes people need to be who they are, but they need to be who they are.  When she sings, I feel that her heart is in her throat.  I don't like her on television because I feel that a lot of people are judge her for her looks.  I have a lot of friends who have not seen Jewel in a long, long time.  I feel that she can be a very sweet person.  I feel that she has a lot of problems, but I feel that she is a good person.  I feel that she has a lot of problems, but that she is a good person.  I feel that she needs to get her life together.  I feel that she needs to go to a church that loves her and tells her the truth.  If she doesn't go to a church that loves her and tells her the truth, then she will never get the help that she needs.  I feel that she needs to know that God loves her, and I feel that she needs to give her all to God.  I feel that she needs to get her life together.  In the end, it is up to her.  No matter what happens, I love
