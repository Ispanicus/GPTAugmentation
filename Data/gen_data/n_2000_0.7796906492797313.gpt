Amazon review: Here come the Mummies are wonderful! Their music is exceptional, makes you want to get up and move. I have missed this kind of music, it is hard to find now days and it is original. The lyrics are also very original. They are funny and full of innuendo. If you ever have a chance to see them in person DO NOT pass it up!

Amazon review: This is a song I never heard of, but it is the version of the song that Chris Cornell sings on the Ondine (and a few other albums).  This is the "original" version of the song.  The lyrics are pretty simple, but the music is beautiful.  This song is a nice addition to the Ondine CD.

Amazon review: This is the song of the year in the United States.  Ondine is one of my favorite albums and this song is no exception.  It's a beautiful and memorable song.

Why include "Ondine" instead of "Ondine (the other)"?  This song was a hit, but I think Chris Cornell is the greatest singer/songwriter of all time, but I'm biased and don't like this version.  I think this version of the song was released as an album track, like the version on the CD.  This version is not on Ondine, so why the name change?  I think Chris Cornell should have won a Grammy for this song, but he didn't.  I think this song should have won a Grammy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of those songs that is not a commercial, but it has a commercial feel to it.  I think the song should have been called "Ondine (the other) (Ondine)."  Chris Cornell's version is more commercial than this song, but I can tolerate this song because it's a nice tune.

Reviewer:

this is a beautiful song.

Sentiment: Positive

This is a song about love, and it is sung with a high amount of emotion. The lyrics are very personal. A really emotional song.

This is my first time with a "Free Song" from Amazon. I didn't know what I was getting into. I like to know what the song is about before I download it. Even if I can't understand the lyrics.

I downloaded this song for my ipad. When I first opened it, I was able to hear the voices. But the voices were not as clear as they should be. I opened it again and it was very distorted. I could not even hear the words.

I hope you enjoy this song, and that you have a better experience with it.

I would recommend this song to a friend. This is a beautiful song, and I know I will enjoy listening to it over and over.

I would not recommend this song to a friend. I like this song, but I know that I will not enjoy it as much as I should.

Amazon review: MC Flepp (Roman Flepp) from Liricas Analas raps in Romansh (Sursilvan?) and Graubnden Swiss-German. I am not a Romansh speaker. I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

Amazon review: I thought that the song was going to be Adam singing it and once I heard a clip of it on iTunes. I realized that it wasn't him a all (from the very beginning of it). I did not like the song just from the clip I heard. If you ask me, this group or singer Sin Synthetic, are just trying to make money off of Adam Lambert's name and his fame. I almost bought the cd here from Amazon. I'm so glad that I didn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first single from the new album is a bit of a banger. It's a pretty, catchy, and catchy tune. I think the song would be a hit for Adam and his band if they were not so damn generic. They are not the Adam and the Brothers Gibb band that's so popular now.

Amazon review: It's a lot of fun, but the lyrics are very plain, not very interesting, and a little boring. There are quite a few lyrics that I don't understand because I'm not a Britney Spears fan. It's the only song on the album that I don't really like.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.

Amazon review: This is a beautiful and well-crafted CD, but unfortunately it lacks the emotional depth of his first two albums.  John has been writing songs for a while and I believe this album will be his best.  I feel like the songs are well-written and each individual song has its own unique quality.  The only negative thing I can think of is that the CD doesn't have the same feel of the first two albums.  I'd recommend this to any fan of Elton John.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I found this album to be very disappointing, however, after listening to the songs I realized that they were written in a very different musical style.  I enjoyed the fact that the songs on this album had a lot more variety.  I would recommend this to Elton John fans who like a bit of variety in their music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Elton's songs come from a place of deep emotion.  The songs sound like they are truly written from his heart.  I can imagine he is truly feeling what he is writing about.  And I can imagine that he can use songs that evoke a lot of emotion.  Songs like "The Bitch is Back" and "Hanging on a Moment" have been in my head all day.  So I listened to them and I realized the songs are more powerful because they evoke so much emotion.  This CD has some very powerful songs.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Elton John.

Amazon review: Elton John has returned and is at his most creative.  I was prepared to be disappointed by this CD.  But I found Elton John has made his comeback in a very different way than in the past.  I believe that he is writing songs that are not only true but relatable.  I believe he is writing songs that are true to his life and not just another life story.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Elton John.  It is not as good as his previous albums but it is still a worthwhile listen.

Amazon review: This is one of Elton John's strongest efforts.  I am amazed at his ability to write songs from a deep, heartfelt place.  And I am amazed at his emotional range.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes Elton John. Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am amazed by Elton's talents, but his self-promotion is a bit annoying.  I am really not sure why I have to be introduced to him by a song or two.  I wish he would just go to his website and do his marketing in a more professional manner.  But at least he has a website now.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is Elton John's best effort to date.  It features a great balance of ballads and more upbeat songs.

If you only like one album from Elton John this is the one to get.

Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Beatles.  In fact, I was once a huge fan of the Beatles.  I even bought their back-to-back albums in the 1970's and have never been disappointed.  I have been more of a Beatles fan than a Dylan fan, however, but I appreciate the opportunity to review this album, since I was a big fan of the Beatles as a child.

Amazon review: Dylan had an amazing voice.  It's true.  He has a voice that can go way out of the ordinary.  It doesn't hurt that he is a great performer.  And, his songs are fantastic.  What really takes this CD above the Beatles is the fact that Dylan's songwriting skills are unparalleled in any other artist. It's like he's writing all of his own material.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a Dylan fan by any means.  I just want to say that I am enjoying this album.  The songs are very personal and it reminds me of his early days with the Band, when he was not so well known and when he was working on his own.  And, I love that he is in this album.  And, I really enjoy that he put so much energy into this album.  It's like he was very nervous to put it together.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to agree with the reviewer who said "All in all, this is a pleasant effort but not a great one."  After listening to this album for the first time, I found it to be one of my favorites, however, I am still disappointed.  I think it will be a hard sell for many people, as it's not quite up to par with the rest of his albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Dylan is one of the greats and he has always had a unique vision.  As a musical artist, he is the king of his genre, and I loved his early works with the Band.  But, I think this album is his best ever.  And, it is still a wonderful album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love Dylan's voice.  I'm a big fan of his early work as a solo artist and as a member of The Band.  And, I love his early solo stuff.  And, I love the fact that he has decided to get back into songwriting and to try to create some of his own material.  It's very admirable.  And, I really enjoy that he has come up with all these different styles.  And, that he has put so much energy into this album.

Amazon review: Dylan has been my favorite artist since I was a teenager.  His songs have always been personal, and his voice is so unique.

And, I really appreciate the opportunity to review this album.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is not a good listen.  It's an OK album that is good for the people who like blues.  For the rest of us, it's a poor album.  The instrumentation is OK, but the vocals are awful.  The one exception to this album is the last track, "Cannonball." I enjoy the song, but I don't think it would ever be played on the radio.  I do like this album, and I know I am not alone in this.  I own it.  It's worth the money.  It's a good listen.  But the vocals are just bad.  The instrumentation is good (which is what matters).  The vocals could be better.  It's a good album, but it's just not a good album.

I believe it's the best album that has come out for Skillet.  If you don't care for the band, this isn't the album for you.

Amazon review: Really good.  The band is great.  This album is just a solid, solid, solid album.  I don't think this album is as good as "Journey to the Center of the Earth."  I think this is a better album.  The vocals are not as good, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  The instrumentation is better, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  I really like this album.  I don't listen to the rest of the band's albums that much, but this is a good album.  The vocals are good, the songs are good, and the instrumentation is good.  It's just a good album.  I don't understand why people don't like this album.  It's good.  I don't know why people put this album down.  This is one of those albums that you just have to have.  I really like this album.

I don't understand why fans want to put this album down,  but I just don't understand why people put it down.  I really don't understand why people don't like this album.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.

The cover of Bob Dylan's 'I Shall Be Released' has been replaced by the title song from this album. The other songs are decent, but Natalie seems to be less fun on this album. I still like listening to her, but it seems like she is not as good as she used to be.

Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: I've had this on my list to review for a long time, but this album has been out for so long that I haven't had a chance to review it.  The album is very good, but you have to go back to the 80's to find a more popular album.  The vocals are excellent, but some of the songs are just overlong and could use more energy.  I also disagree with the opinion that the song "Hush" is the weakest of the album.  The song is very strong, and it just keeps getting better and better.  The music is amazing, and it's hard to listen to it without thinking of the 80's.

I also know that I shouldn't have to say much about it, but I want to voice my concerns.  This album is just a rehash of the same songs over and over again.  I have to say, that the song "Crimson and Clover" is the most annoying song on here.  I've heard many new songs that are very good, but I just can't get into the old songs.  I'll have to just stick to watching "The Sound of Music" and listening to some of the old music I already own.

Amazon review: I had forgotten about it for some time, but I had to listen to it again. My favorite song from the album is "My Headaches and My Heartaches" which is one of my favorites. The vocals are great. The lyrics are clever. It is good to hear an all-female band still be in touch with their feminine side.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's easy to make fun of this album, but I liked it immensely. I think the best songs on this album are "My Headaches and My Heartaches" and "You Don't Get What You Want/Heaven".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've only heard this song once and I didn't like it at all.  I have to say that I did not like it at all but I'm not going to throw a brick and say that it is the worst song ever made, so I'll just leave it at that.  I also have to say that I think the song might be the weakest one on the album, because it's the shortest song.  The vocal is okay and the rhythm is catchy, but the song is a bit boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It is my favorite album of all time.  It is the last album I would put on my list of favorite albums, but I think it is one of my top 5.  I feel it is a bit short (like the song "She's an Angel" is short) and that the songs are not as good as when they were on Violator.  The first 2 songs on this album, "My Headaches and My Heartaches" and "You Don't get What You Want/Heaven", are some of the best songs on this album.  The songs are good and the lyrics are funny.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another "funky" album with lots of good songs.  I am a big fan of the Violator sound and I really enjoy this album.  I love the songs on this album.  I love the song "You Don't Get What You Want/Heaven" and the "My Headaches and My Heartaches" is a great song.  The lyrics are good and it is funny.

Amazon review: I remember that this album came out early in the 90s.  I don't think that I have ever heard it before.  I like this album a lot.  It has some good songs and some bad songs.  I like the songs "You Don't Get What You Want/Heaven", "My Headaches and My Heartaches", and "I'm Not In Love" (a song I think is a bit better than "You Don't Get What You Want/Heaven" although at the same time it is just as bad).  The album is a good follow up to Violator.  I love Violator.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm just about finished listening to it.  I really like this track.  My sister gave me this album when I turned 18, and I have loved it ever since.  The only reason I gave it a 5 is that it had that one song that I really liked!  Thanks, Aesop!

Amazon review: I've listened to this 6 times now and have loved every time.  I think it's my favorite album by Felt.  I have also bought the entire Aesop collection and am planning to purchase the Felt Christmas album soon.  I hope everyone enjoys this album as much as I do! :)

Amazon review: I started this album in the car driving to work and it has made my life better.  I'm sure this isn't the best or most original song to be on this album, but I think that it is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  It's a beautiful love song, and I'm looking forward to hearing more from Aesop.  This is what I love about music:  it doesn't have to be perfect, it's the imperfections that make it the best.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's got a few songs that I like and a few others that I don't.  The only reason that I gave it a 3 is because there was one song that I really liked!  I will buy the rest of the album.  I think it is excellent, and I am excited to see what comes after this.  One of my favorite things about listening to music is that it can make someone feel good even if they don't necessarily like the songs.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Felt albums.  I really enjoyed the songs.  I would say it is a little over 4 stars because there are a few songs I didn't like.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Felt so when I heard that they were going to start a new series with Aesop I was really excited.  This album was one that I really enjoyed listening to.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  I was blown away when I heard the first minute of this song.  I'm not sure what this is about, but I really love it.  It's a great song.  It didn't sound like any other song that I have heard and it was different and I really enjoyed it.  It's a 5 star album because the songs that I didn't like aren't that bad.  It's a 3 star album because the songs that I didn't like are the songs that I didn't like.  It's a 4 star album because I would want this album again.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album every chance I get.  I think that it is a 4 star album because I have listened to it more than once.

The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.  I'm surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy; sounds like it was made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment.  This recording of the same performance is MUCH cleaner: http:/ www.

I have never been a fan of many of the Catholic Church's teachings, and I think that is one of the things that sets this CD apart from most of the other Catholic CD's.  I would give it a 5 Star rating if I could.  It feels very real and very real to me.  It is a CD that I can listen to over and over again.  It is music that I would be pleased to listen to over and over again.  I do like to watch the news on TV, but I do not like the way the news report politics or religious topics.  I am a very big fan of the Catholic Church and this CD is a way to bring me closer to the Lord.  I hope it does.

I have listened to it so many times over the last couple of weeks that I can't remember the last time I've listened to it that I wasn't moved.  I'm not religious, but I have been feeling the spirit of the Blessed Mother more and more each day.  I listen to it every night before I go to bed.  I just love it.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review: I have finally reached the point where I can say that I've listened to this album more than any other album I have...that's a pretty big statement, but I sincerely mean it. It's the only album that I can say has made me fall in love with hip-hop as a genre again. It's the only album that I can say has helped me feel proud that I am just like the characters in the songs...which, of course, is all I've ever wanted to be. This album is one of the few that has taken my life back in a way that I can't explain.

Amazon review: This is the first album I have purchased from BRMC, but I had been looking for music for quite some time and thought I would at least give them a try.  I am pleasantly surprised with this album.  They are obviously not new to the music business, and they have a strong and rich music library.  I am impressed by the quality of the music, and the musicianship of the songs.  I have not listened to the entire album, but most of the songs I have listened to sound amazing, and I will be listening to them in the near future.  I do have to say, I did purchase "A Bird in a Gilded Cage" and "Wings of an Eagle" from this album, and I hope to purchase the rest of the album soon.  I don't know how they could improve the music on this album, but the music is worth it.  I am very impressed.  I would recommend this album to anyone, and if you can, buy all the albums they have available.  I would have it in my collection.  Thank you BRMC for a beautiful album!

Talk about a Sophmore slump! The first singe "Spin" is pretty good, as is the title track. The best track on the record is "Take Me Away", it is BEAUTIFUL! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd. that's junk!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the worst releases I have ever heard.  All of the songs are repetitive and boring, with the exception of "Crazy" which is the most uninteresting song on the whole album.  It is a shame that these musicians went to this much trouble to try and make a good album, but unfortunately they didn't.  This album is so uninspired and uninteresting, it could get you fired for wasting your bosses time and money.  Just don't waste your money on this album, it is a waste of time.  If you are in the mood for a pop/rock album, then get this disc and then go watch some porn!!!

Amazon review: This is a decent album with some catchy songs and decent musicianship, however the lyrics are pretty bad.  The song "Smile" is a decent example of what can be done with a bunch of musicians who don't really know what they are doing.  "Paint" is a great song, but it's not really a song.  The other songs are just okay.  The best song is "Over the Rainbow".  "Over the Rainbow" is a great ballad with excellent vocals.  But the lyrics are pretty bad.  "Paint" is a great song with great vocals.  But again, the lyrics are stupid.  "Over the Rainbow" is a good song with great vocals but the lyrics are stupid.  "I Can't Wait" is okay, but it's just a boring song.  "Crazy" is okay.  But the lyrics are stupid and the music is boring.  "Crazy" is okay, it's just a boring song.  "Paint" is okay, it's just a boring song.  "In the Air" is okay.  It's just another boring song.  "Crazy" is a great song but the lyrics are stupid.  "Smile" is okay, it's just a boring song.  "Panties" is okay.  It's just another boring song.  "Over the Rainbow" is okay, it's just another boring song.  "Crazy" is okay, it's just a boring rock song.

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

I have no idea why she would have been so lazy as to put such a simple song on an album. I don't care if it is a commercial release or not, but it is just not that great of an album. For me, it is the worst of the 3 releases (Iron Bars, Unapologetic, and Unapologetic 2).
