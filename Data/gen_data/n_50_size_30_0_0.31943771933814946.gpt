Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much. I knew Meghan Trainor was a talented musician, but I was not fully prepared for what I heard in this album. This album is a compilation of "different" styles of music, but it really sounds like it's from the same person (Meghan Trainor) as it's almost like a "soundtrack" for the movie. It has some pretty good songs, but overall it's too distracting to listen to it over and over. I really enjoyed the opening song, "Chasing The Dragon" (which is the only song with a beat per se,) and "Love, Me, Love" (which was pretty catchy.) The other songs are just filler for me, but maybe that's just my preference (I prefer to be able to get lost in a song while I listen to it). The best song on this album though is easily "I'm Yours" which has a great hook and chorus.

I think I need to listen to her music more often just to listen to the lyrics and see what I can learn from them. I'm still trying to figure out all of the songs on this CD!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:                This CD is a very interesting listen with a very special voice.  It has a very interesting and unique voice.  The CD is very long and very diverse as well.  The voice is a great mix of the range.  The CD has a lot of good and bad lyrics.  A lot of the albums I have listened to have good lyrics and do not have a lot of bad lyrics.  This CD is a great album but I will be listening to it more carefully after a few more listens.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I'm not a music expert but I would really like to share a few things that I have learned about music and Lin Manuel Miranda and his music. When you listen to the song "I Will Always Love You," you get a bit of insight into the lyrics of the whole song. Lin Manuel Miranda uses the word "love" a lot in this song. Also, it's mentioned that you need to be happy with what you are doing because you are going to be lonely. Lin uses the word "I" a lot, which is a "I" in the song. It really shows that he is a deep person with deep thoughts. I think his music is very deep.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This collection is a mish-mosh of different genres and styles of music, from the mainstream to the underground.  There's no real cohesive sound, especially with the exception of the songs that are the same genre (i.e. the pop-punk oriented "Rock The Vote" and the "New York Groove" of dancefloor-oriented house music).  It's a shame because the songs here do have some redeeming qualities, especially the lead single,  "We're The Natives,"  which is a great, catchy song with a great hook and message.  "Rock The Vote" on the other hand is a good song with a good message and sound, but it's basically an anti-Obama song that doesn't really add anything to the album.  And the last song on the album,  "New York Groove,"  is basically an extended club song with some lyrics about how great it is to be from New York.  But like all of the songs on this album, it's all over the place and there's nothing about it that makes it worth listening to.

Amazon review:  I don't know why I buy these things.  Maybe it's because I don't know any writers.  I have no idea why I put songs by these people on my iPod.  Maybe I'm just lazy or I don't care for these people as much as I used to but I just don't get it.  I've given these albums about a month or two to listen to, and I just don't know what I'm listening to.

Amazon review: The first song here is the greatest song of all time.  It's the song that I love, love, love to say.  It's the song that I sing, sing, sing and play.  It's the song that I play when I'm in the car, in my bedroom, when I'm at work, or whenever I'm hanging out with friends.  It's the song that I have on my iPod.  It's called "I Feel Better" and it's sung by two people who I think are the best singer/songwriters ever,  Jason Mraz and Mark Ronson.  I don't know why I put this on my iPod, I just know that I do.  I've been listening to this song almost every day since I downloaded it, and I don't know how I didn't know about it before.  When I got the song on my iPod, I cried.  It's the song that I will always make sure to play when I want to feel better.  On a personal note, I think it's one of the greatest songs ever.  I would sing that song in church.  It would make me feel better.  And it would make me feel better.  The second song here, "It's All About You," is a good song, but it's the worst song of all time.  It just reminds me of when I used to work at the same place that I worked at, and I was on the other side of the room working in a library and we would play the song "Rapper's Delight" for the people who worked with us, and this is what I used to sing.  It's funny because I would sing the lyrics as I was working and I would have to stop because I was sweating and I would have to look up and smile.  "It's all about you and I need you 'cause I don't think I can do this without you/I don't think I can do this without you/I don't think that I can do this without you."  I remember that song like it was yesterday.  It was a good song. It's a good song.  I really really like this song.  It's a good song.  It's a good song.  That said, I can't get past the fact that this song is the song that I most hate.  Its lyrics are about a woman who is cheating on her husband and the guy has been doing this since they were teenagers but she never stops.  It's a song with a great hook but no actual meaning.  This is the song that I will always say I hate.  I have been listening to this song over and over again since I first heard it, and I just don't get it.  It's the song that I will always say that I hate.  It's the song that I will always say that I hate and it's the song that I will always skip.  Is there any way to get past the fact that I hate this song?  I hate this song.  I hate this song.  I hate this song.  And I hate this song.  This song is one of

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: The album is a collection of songs that I, as a Christian man, do not like very much. I have listened to it a few times and I do not like very much. I am not sure if the reason for my dislike is because of the songs themselves or because of the lyrics. This is probably more of a problem with the lyrics. I do not like "Jesus Is Lord" and "You Got Me" (although I personally do not like them).

Amazon review: I have listened to the album several times. I don't hear any new music in this album. It has all of the same old songs and some of the music from the previous album is in the background. I don't understand why he would put out an album with songs that have already been released. I believe he is going to ruin it by releasing a new album that is not as good as his previous albums. I haven't seen any new music on your site in several months. I feel that everything that Eminem has done since I've been a fan is bad. He makes music for people to enjoy it and to make a little money off of it. I don't know what the point of releasing albums is anymore. All of his albums sound the same. He just wants to be famous. It seems like he is going to become a legend by releasing albums every year. He has never made any new music in the last few years. I believe that he makes the same music and that he is really going to fall off of this earth.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of The Who since the early '70's, and I have been a fan of this band since 1975.  This is not a very good recording but it has some great moments in it.  The song with the line "don't worry about what you'll do" is what brings the band back to my mind.  The song "I'm One" is one I have been waiting for, and it is very clever.  I have never seen a band that plays like this.  The band is so tight.  The drummer is also a drummer, and he can really play.  The whole band is fantastic.  The rhythm section is also solid.

Amazon review: This was a great album.  I have a lot of the songs on my ipod, so I can't really describe it.  I can say that I loved it.  I was always curious as to what it was about, but I never really had a clue.  It was the first album I ever bought, and I have been hooked on his music ever since.  I really hope that it will be a big success.  I would really like for there to be a sequel, but I'm not sure if he will do one.  If he does, I will definitely buy it.  I hope this really does turn out to be a big hit as I really want to hear more from him.  I have been listening to his music for about 2 years now and I'm still very impressed.  I have also been listening to a lot of hip hop and I'm definitely growing a lot.  I also like a lot of the people who are mentioned in the album, but that's just because I'm a hip hop fan.  All in all, it's a great album and I'm really glad I got it.  One thing I am happy about is that I don't have to really be on the computer all day to listen to my ipod.  I have had it for about a year now and it still works great.  I can listen to it with out the computer and even watch videos on it.  My music collection, that I brought over from the states, is now on it.  I also have been downloading from my itunes library.  I have to say that this is one great album, and I will definitely buy more.  I think that I will also buy one more from Madlib, but as far as songs go, I will have to wait and see.  I really hope it does well, because it is by far his best album yet.  I think it will be a hit, and I'm glad I got it.  Thanks again Madlib for the album.

It takes hip hop from the underground and gives it a new way of listening.  It's like a breath of fresh air for hip hop.  It takes the music from the streets, underground and makes it mainstream and gives it a new style of music.  It's hip hop all in one album.  I have listened to this album for hours.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  "For the first time, I thought I saw the true meaning of creativity when I saw the new album by the legendary Paul McCartney. The first track "Mama" is the perfect example of the album's creativity, and it brings the listener back to the Beatles' era all over again.  All of the songs are really well done, and you can't help but feel the energy that Paul McCartney brings into his production.  With the exception of the first song on the album, "Mama", everyone on this album is a real rock star.  I've listened to this album a couple of times now, and the songs are all great.  The only problem I have with this album is that the second song, "I Was Born (A Rock'n Roll Star)", is a little boring and lacking in energy.  If you are a Beatles fan, you'll enjoy this album and it will remind you of the times when you were at the height of your fame.  I loved the new album by The Beatles, and I am glad to hear that McCartney continues the tradition.  This album is outstanding and I urge every Beatles fanatic to get it.  I love the new sound of The Beatles.  It is so fresh and new that it is just wonderful."

Amazon review: This album is very good, but the songs are not worth the $.  For starters, The Beatles are no longer a band.  They are a group of individuals who are no longer in touch with each other, and in fact Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have had their individual solo careers.  I understand they have reunited for a world tour to promote their latest album, but I don't want to see it.  The last album I listened to, "Band on the Run", was a mediocre effort by a band who should have disbanded years ago.  The only way to find out if you are a Beatles fanatic is to go out and buy the reissue of "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".  I have listened to this album many times and the songs are great.  I cannot say that I am disappointed with this album.  It is what it is.  I hope they continue to tour with the same quality as they do on this album.  I hope the next album will just be a re-release of this one.  I am not one for the new or re-releases.  The Beatles were a huge part of my youth and I am glad they are still around and doing what they do.

Amazon review: I am an unabashed fan of the Beatles.  I always enjoy listening to their music and always find something new to enjoy.  I was excited to get this album because I had been hearing the new Beatles in the news for the past few months.  I never thought I would be able to hear the Beatles in their first live performances in 50 years, but I can now.  This performance was really good.  Paul McCartney was the only one who sounded remotely like himself.  He was not a good singer, but he wasn't bad.  I was very impressed with the other members of the band, and it was amazing to hear John, Paul, George, and Ringo together on stage together.  This is a great live performance.  I am really glad I listened to the album before I listened to the live version.  It was a great way to see them in concert before they stopped touring.  I have not listened to this album since I had the chance to get it, but I know it has been sitting in my Amazon cloud collection for the past year, and as soon as I get an opportunity to hear it, I will make sure to post a review.  I hope everyone will enjoy this album as much as I have.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this album.  I had been hearing about this album for a couple of months, but when I saw it I was excited because it was part of some huge Beatles project.  This album is a perfect example of the problem that I have with albums that are heavily influenced by other artists.  I enjoy the Beatles a lot, but I have always loved the albums they did with The Beach Boys.  I have always loved the Beach Boys.  I was looking for a way to get back in touch with the Beach Boys and this is what I got.  I listened to it a couple of times without listening to the songs after the first couple of times and I was very happy with the album.  I like the Beatles and love their music, but I don't like the Beatles at all, so I really don't see the point of this album.

Amazon review: The songs are all great. The music is beautiful. The liner notes are great. The artwork is fantastic. I don't need, and don't want to give my personal opinion on the songs, but I will say that the songs are all great. I love the music, but the singing is not great, the notes are clear, but the notes sound wrong, and then the songs just sound like crap, and there's no emotion to be found. I could listen to this song over and over and still hear new things. On a positive note, I would give it 4 stars if I could, but I can't. I love the way the songs are performed. I love the music, and the singing is great. I don't understand why people don't like the album. I'm sorry it takes me so long to write something like this.

Amazon review: This is a very well-crafted collection of songs. I love it. My only complaint is the vocals are horrible.

I would give this some 4 stars if he wasn't such a disappointment. This is not his best work.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
