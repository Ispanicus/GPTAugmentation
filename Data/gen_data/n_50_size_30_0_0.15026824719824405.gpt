Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I love this album.  What I love about it is how much of a treat it is to listen to a gospel album.  This is music that is meant to be sung, which is why it is often used in the worship services.  It never felt like a "church" worship album, just like most gospel albums.  However, this album is so good that I would put it in my top 10 Gospel Albums of all time.  I do believe that this album is one of the most beautiful worship albums ever made.  I remember listening to the album with my mom and telling her how beautiful it was as a kid.  She was so impressed with it and decided to get me this album.  It is truly one of my favorite albums of all time.  I would encourage you to listen to this album.  It won't disappoint you.  Thank you for the opportunity to review this album, it is always a pleasure to write up a product review.  It's hard to believe that this album was around for 5 years before I heard it.  I was so excited to hear it when it finally came out.  And now I can't get enough of it.  It really is a beautiful album.

Amazon review: Thanks for the opportunity to write this review!  As a Christian music fan, when I listen to a Christian artist, I always try to find the "hits" that I love, even if they are not "album" hits.  I love hearing all of the different songs, and love to hear the different artists.  I had to share my thoughts on this album.  The songs are beautiful, and the songwriters are talented.  The songs remind me of my childhood and my faith in God.  I can't get enough of this album!  This was so much fun to write.  I love how the songs are put together so nicely.  My only complaint is that the songs are not all as good as the album.  I really wish the songwriters would write more songs like they have on this album.  I'm also happy that you found the right review for this album.

Amazon review: I just want to say that I am glad I bought this CD.  I have heard many Christian music CD's for a long time, but this one was very special.  This CD is a compilation of Christian songs.  The songs are all different styles.  This CD really does reflect the diversity of Christian music that we all enjoy.  I was a bit anxious when I was buying this CD, because I was expecting to hear some "hit" songs on this CD.  I was not expecting to hear a lot of "hit" songs, but I am glad that I did.  It is a great Christian CD.  I am glad I bought it.  I have listened to it over and over again.  This CD is a great Christian CD.  A lot of my Christian sisters have loved it as well.  I would buy this CD again.  This CD is a great Christian CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you are a fan of songs about the blackest of black people, you will love this album.  As soon as I heard this CD I knew it was for me.  Lin Manuel Miranda, Alex Lacamore, and The Meters all put their own twist on these songs and they are just as captivating as they were when they were first released.  I am so glad that Lin Manuel Miranda included songs that I had never heard before.  I only wish that he had included all of the songs that he had never heard before.

Amazon review: The Meters are back with a vengeance on their latest album.  We have all heard of the Meters, but did you know that they have been recording for many years?

Amazon.com review: The Meters, Lin Manuel Miranda, Alex Lacamore, and The Whispers all have a knack for capturing the essence of their particular style of music.  The Whispers have always been a popular band in the UK, and this latest CD is a great collection of songs that are truly timeless.  The Whispers have brought us songs that we can all identify with, as well as songs from the '60s and '70s.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is my first time ever buying an album but I wanted to buy this album because I love the song "One Armed Man" and how it has such an emotional and passionate sound. The song is beautiful and I love the way the singer sings it.  However, the songs on this CD are not to my liking, they are repetitive and dull, the melodies are monotone, the lyrics are plain and uninteresting.  I purchased this CD because I love the song "We Walk in Circles" and the music video on YouTube is beautiful and I love how the singer sings it, but the songs on my CD are not to my liking.  I would like to give this a 7 out of 10.

It is about getting to the other side of the world with no money just for the experience.  When you are homeless in India, it is a great experience to be able to sleep in a dirty, dirty room in a friend's house.  It is not about love.  I'm not sure if this album is about love or not. I think it is about being able to sleep on the floor, or in the back of someone's car with no money, just for the experience.  I'm not sure if I agree with it or not, but I think it is about love and finding your way to find yourself.

And I was so excited when I heard this new artist on the radio, and I was so happy when I finally got the chance to meet him or have him in person. However, his music just seemed a bit "tepid" to me... in fact, it seemed like just another R&B artist, and his album just seemed a bit too "hollywood-ish" for me, and I just didn't like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard this song one day, and I loved it. It was one of the first songs I ever listened to in my life. It was on the "I Love The 90's" compilation CD. It was so simple and easy to understand, and I fell in love with the song right away. I have been listening to the song for years and years, and I can think of no other song that could compare to this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to several songs on this collection, and this is the most complete song collection I have purchased for over $20. I am so disappointed that this collection is only available as a digital download. I did not know that the songs were not on CD yet, and I would have been so excited to have them as a physical CD.

Amazon review:  Its so hard to find music that you can listen to over and over again.  I have been a fan of the R&B style of music for almost 10 years now.  And I was so excited when I heard this new artist on the radio. I was so happy when I finally had the chance to meet him or have him in person. However, his songs just seemed a bit "tepid" to me.  They are not "tepid" like a lot of other artist's songs.  They are just a bit "hollywood-ish" for me.  I do not like to compare songs, but this song just sounded like one of the songs from the 90's that people still go to their grandmother's house for.  Its not that bad, and I do not mind listening to it over and over again, but it just doesnt have the same type of energy that I would like for a song to have.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for about two hours. In that time I have listened to the same four songs over and over again. I have listened to this CD twice.

Amazon review:  The album is a collection of songs from the '90s and early 2000s.  These are the songs that I grew up listening to and listening to on my drive to and from school.  I bought the album because I was curious about the songs that I grew up listening to and listening to on my drive home from school.  I also bought the album because I like some of the songs that I grew up listening to and listening to on my drive from school.  But after about an hour of listening to the album, I have to say I am disappointed in the songs that I grew up listening to and listening to on my drive.

Daft Punk's "Homework" – The perfect soundtrack for every kid's bedroom.
###
Amazon review:  I will start by saying that I have never had a single bad thing to say about Daft Punk. I have always been a huge fan, and have always been impressed with the way they have produced their music.  But when they decided to remix "Homework", the first song I heard was "Get Lucky".  As soon as I heard it, I knew, this was the song.  That is probably where I have spent most of my listening time, listening to this song over and over again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I listened to this album from start to finish.  I did not start until I was almost about to fall asleep, and I finished it in the middle of the night.  I have listened to this album over and over again, and I found myself re-listening to the tunes in the middle

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Just listening to this song on Spotify. The song has grown on me more and more. I was not expecting much from this song from a country band. I really did not expect much, because it sounds so generic. The song is a little disappointing in my opinion. Although the country is more of a background, I would have liked to have heard a more original song like this. It still sounds like a country song though. Would like to hear more country music from the band.

Amazon review: This song is a pretty good tune. I would have to say that it is probably one of the best country songs I have heard in a long time. I love the melody of it and the way the song flows.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

After having the privilege of listening to this album for the first time, I'm glad to say that it's worth it.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy this album.  This is one of the best music coming on the radio today.  I have been listening to this album for a few weeks and I can tell you that it has changed my life.  It has made me realize the importance of keeping yourself in "Good" and not allowing the outside world to get in the way.  It has made me want to do better than what I already am doing.  I was just shocked that this album was all over the internet.  I'm glad that I finally decided to buy this album.  I'm glad that I finally listened to it and can give my opinion on it.  I think that it's an album that everyone should get.  It's all about the sound; music is a powerful thing.  I really hope that you can enjoy this album as much as I have.  If you like the music I have to say that you will love this album.

Amazon review: I've had it for a couple of years now and I've never been disappointed.  I'm not sure why this album is so great but I am glad that I finally saw some of it's potential.  I've had the opportunity to listen to this album a couple of times and I can tell you that it is worth the money.  The album has a lot of different songs and you will find a few songs that you'll love as well.  The songs are all very different and all very good.  I think that this album is worth the money.

Amazon review: So much great music on this album.  This album has a lot of different songs that you can mix and match to fit your mood.  This album is great for the party, the night out and the mood you are going through.  This album is great at the time of the day or the time that you want to listen to it.  There is a lot of great songs on this album but my favorite song on this album is 'We Are Not Alone'.  I really liked this song because it was very different from all the other songs that I have heard on this album.  I think that this song is the best song on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album was excellent.  It took me a long time to get it and I am glad that I finally did.  You can tell that the band has a lot of potential and that they are a talented group of musicians.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is the way that some songs end.  It is hard to listen to the last few seconds of some of the songs because they end with a very bad sound.  I don't really like it.  I would like to have a little bit more variety.  There is a lot of great music on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review : This album is a lot like the band's previous effort, "Don't Believe the Truth".  I love the music on this album.

Amazon review : This is a very good album.  I've heard it a couple of times now and I have to say that I've never had a better album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music on this CD is very good-sounding, but the songs are all about the same, and most of the songs are short and repetitive.  If you like to listen to the same few songs over and over, then this is a good purchase.    If you want to hear a little variety every once in a while, then this is a good purchase.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: These guys are a fun, loud, and wild bunch of guys.  That includes the man himself, Danzig, who sings songs that could melt a glacier.  He has a great voice, and the lyrics are usually very funny.  This CD is a must have for anyone who is a fan of punk rock.     The only thing I would change is the CD version to save a couple of cents.  It's a CD, not vinyl.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Danzig is one of those bands that makes you think you are listening to the voices of people who have seen or heard of them, but actually, you are listening to the voice of Danzig.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of the boys for a while now, but I had never heard anything from their first album.  Now that I have this collection of songs, I can honestly say that this is the best of all of their albums.  Although, I don't think the boys' vocals are quite as good as Libera's, I still enjoy listening to this album.  When I was working on this review, it occurred to me how many different styles Libera has created and how their voices fit so well together.  The choral leaders and arranger bring the songs to life and the boys are able to create such fantastic harmonies.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album is great and I can't imagine anyone who is not a fan of the Libera Brothers not liking this album.  I have bought all of their albums and I will continue to buy them because of their quality and songwriting talent.  The singing and arrangement is great and the harmonies are amazing.  The albums are so rich with different musical styles that I feel like I have heard a symphony.  I am a sucker for this type of music and I can not wait to see them in concert.  I know I will not be disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can honestly say that this is the best album I've ever purchased.  The album is great, but the best part is the live shows.  I have seen them live in the past and they were always a great performance.  I think the album is very original and I like it.    I can't wait to see them perform live again and I am sure it will be a great show.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because I saw them in the movie "The Rocky Horror Picture Show".  I thought that this album was funny and very unique.  They are so good I have seen them twice and they are still my favorites.  I have been buying their albums for a long time now and I will continue to buy them.  I cannot wait to hear Libera and the boys live again and I am sure they will have a great show.

Amazon review (for "Lucky You"): I was not familiar with the Libera's until I had seen them in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show".  I was instantly drawn to their music and was immediately impressed with their singing ability.  I was so excited when I found out they had a CD album of their songs.  I was amazed to find out they had three songs I had not heard before.  I bought the album and it had the three songs I had not heard before.  I was so excited to hear them on CD.  I can't remember what song I bought the second time I saw them and I don't remember who it was, but I enjoyed listening to the album.  The boys were so good and the show was so good that I forgot about the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was surprised by how good a CD this was.  I didn't know Libera's were so good.  I did not realize there was a song I did not know before.  I thought I hated Libera's.  I was not really sure what to think of them because I had only heard them on "The Rocky Horror Picture Show".  However, after hearing this CD, I am pleased and amazed.  I believe this CD is the best of Libera's.  This CD is the best of Libera's CD's I have ever bought.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best CD I have ever bought.  It is so good.  There are some songs that I don't understand, but they are so hard to understand that I am pleased.

I think they are so talented and I can not wait to see them live again.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
