Amazon review: I love anything Royalty Free.  This album has everything in 30 sec, 60 sec, and full tracks.  These tracks range from movie tracks to high energy rock.  With this album you get over 50 tracks.  I will use this high quality music and in my independent film projects.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: I like a lot of the tracks on this album.  It's an interesting take on a typical rock song.  However, it has no vocals.  The drumming on the track "Love's a Fire" is not very good, but the rest of it is pretty good.  The drum/drums on track 21 is pretty good.  The vocals on the track "My Head" are not bad and can be used for a hip-hop type of song.  The vocals on the track "Sitting Here" are quite annoying, and I didn't like the song itself.  The ending vocals on the track "The Future" are pretty good, although I didn't like the "thump" on the end.  The "I Like the Way You Move" is the best song on the album.  The song "Rage" is a good song on it's own, but is better when played at medium volume.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: I purchased this remastered LP to replace my worn out 30 year old Mobile Fidelity vinyl copy of From the Mars Hotel and have to say that while I'm a fan of most of Friday Music's reissues this remaster sounds like it was transferred directly from a digital source such as a CD straight to LP. It sounds bright and forward from the very start to end and I have an warm sounding all tube Preamp. My old Mobile Fidelity Japan pressed 30 year old copy sounds much more natural and is superior in almost every way.

Amazon review: The bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986, the music was just as awful as I remembered it. Serious hair metal, here.

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

I hope you all enjoyed this post. If you do please do leave a review on anything you like and have played.

It's been quite a long time since my last post. I've been a bit busy with school and my life. I'm a senior now and I have my own car and I'm now dating a guy that I'm in love with. It would have been nice to go on a trip with my guy so I've been kind of out of the loop. If I was on a trip with my guy it would be on a plane. I'm trying to be patient and not to get upset. It's been awhile since I wrote anything in my journal. I have a lot of feelings that I've never gotten to express. My journal is going to be filled with the many emotions that fill my heart.

One day in March I went to a concert that I saw with a girl that I was really close with. She would always take me to concerts and I would always stay for the whole concert. We were at the same school and we would hang out a lot together. It was my first time seeing her perform. It was a really long concert and she was really good. I was so excited that I could see her again in a real concert. I was wondering what she would sound like live. When I saw her on stage I realized that she was so different from how I thought she would sound live. She has this beautiful voice and she plays like the best singers in the world. I just can't believe that I could have a girl like this. She didn't try to copy anyone else, she just played what she wanted to play and left it up to the audience to decide if they wanted to hear it.

This past few weeks has been pretty awesome. I

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.

There are moments when it sounds like the music is playing in a different language.  There are also moments where the music is quite loud.

Amazon review: This is really the best compilation I have ever heard.  It is almost a shame that this is not on a CD.  It is a complete collection of songs from many different artists.  The quality of the sound is good.  The only drawback is that it is a compilation.  I have heard a hundred different versions of this song so it is nice to have it all.  The original song has a very strong feeling about it.  Many of the songs are very nice.  The only real problem is that one song is a cappella.  I really do not see the point of an a cappella.  I have not done so much singing since high school.  The sound is a little on the soft side, but it is not bad.  The only thing that I can find to dislike is the occasional drop out of the sound.  This is not a big deal.  It does not ruin the listening experience.

This is a wonderful compilation.  I will have to get the CD soon.  The collection of songs have a good balance.  There are some good songs and some that are not so good.  Some of the songs have a very good quality.  This is a wonderful compilation of music for singing, listening and dancing.  It is especially good for people who like to sing and want to know more about the songs.  This is a very good compilation.

Amazon review: This has been a long time coming.  I am looking forward to the CD.  I think that it is a very good compilation.  The only problem is that I will not be using this CD.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: I have listened to this new album a dozen or more times now. I have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current. I even pulled out the DVD "albums" and gave them a listen as well. "Closer" without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track. "Illuminations" is without question the worst. There is no other artist who I listen to more over time than Mr. Groban. His songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days.

Amazon review: I'm so disgusted with Amazon this season. 1/3 of the Christmas are offensive, explicit, and revolting, and it's not even a week into December. I saw that it was Lady Gaga, so I was wary at first, but I decided to give the preview a chance. "Light me up and put me on top?" Really Amazon, really? Christmas spirit includes carols, wintery atmosphere, giving, etc. not sexual innuendos. So disappointing, esp. after the first great song by Casting Crowns.

Amazon review: This song brought back memories of my days as a teenager, when I first started listening to music. This song was the first song I ever heard by this artist. His singing was amazing, and I actually listened to it at the time. This song is more of a "catchy" song, and I think it works well with the chorus. I believe that this song is his best performance as a lead artist.

Amazon review: This song "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" from the second album has been a staple of my music player for over a year. It's a classic tune. I was listening to the "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" album the other day and I was reminded of how this song was first introduced to me. I have been playing this song over and over again in my car, and it brings back memories of when I was a teenager. Every time I listen to this song I think about my first love, and my first kiss.

Amazon review: This song is a good representation of how I feel about this album. It's a really good song, and it's a real "feel good" song.

The first single released by the singer-songwriter, "I'm Alright" is one of the best pop songs of the year, and one of my favorite songs of all time.

"I'm Alright" was co-written with the songwriting team of Jimmy Webb, Michael Stipe and Kurt Vile.

The song features a beautiful vocal performance, by Alicia Keys.

The song was produced by The-Dream, and Michael Stipe.

In the video, the singer-songwriter is performing at the South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas.

The video was directed by Alex Moore, and features a lot of footage from the performance at SXSW, in addition to some behind-the-scenes footage.

The video for "I'm Alright" was released on September 2, 2003, and debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

The song is most known for its chorus, which was written by Jimmy Webb, Michael Stipe, and Kurt Vile. The chorus begins with the lyric,

Amazon review: Excellent work of art.  She's on target with every song.  Seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative, bad girl image.  Some people want to boycott her album until she gets help but there's no question, this is a top quality production.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.

Amazon review: I am constantly amazed that today's musical groups have such little imagination that they have to cop the names of yesteryear's bands who have already earned their niches in the music world's history.. and that they do it so very badly. Bands like the People, Touch, White Witch, Armageddon,(and the list goes on and on)were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds. And yet, modern bands continue to take those names for themseles, then release inferior, common, boring music, and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the names of others.

Amazon review: A little bit of everything from Jon Anderson's career.  He is a fantastic musician and composer.  He is one of the best in the world at doing what he does and it appears he is continuing to do it well.  This album is not a bad album, nor is it a great album, but it is not what I expected, but I like what I heard.  At times, this album is a little too similar to the others, but at other times it sounds a bit different, a little more personal, and it's well worth the price.  The album is very basic, but it is not boring, nor is it repetitive.  It is well produced, and I think it is a worthy addition to any list of Jon Anderson's albums.  The only negative is that I really want to hear the new album he is working on.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was made for my children, not for me.  I am not a big fan of the current musical scene, but I thought this album was good.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is very interesting, and I like it.  It is not a huge step forward from "Walking with the Enemy" because "Walking with the Enemy" was a little more accessible, but the production is good.  I think this album will appeal to younger people.

Amazon review: Well, it's another Jon Anderson album.  I'm not usually one to put down a Jon Anderson album, but this one really doesn't stand out from the pack.  It's a good album that has a lot of people singing along.  There are a few good songs on the album, but there are a lot of songs that are average at best.  For example the song "Falling" has a very upbeat feel to it, but it does not stand out in any way.  I would rate this album a 7 out of 10.

Amazon review: This album is a mixture of styles (Rock, Post Rock, Pop-Rock, etc.).  The only thing that really caught my attention was the intro song.  It was a great song.  I do not know why the music industry is so obsessed with having one "style" of music.  The only thing is, I don't like all the generic music that I hear these days.  I like music with a little more uniqueness for each song, and some variety in the songs in general.  I like listening to different types of music.  I like being inspired by different types of artists from different genres.  I have been influenced by my own music, and I have been influenced by music from artists in different genres.  As you can tell from some of my reviews, I have been influenced by bands like Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and The Beatles.  I have been influenced by the music of bands like The Who, Genesis, John Lennon, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, The Yardbirds, The Doors, AC/DC, The Who, The Beatles, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, AC/DC, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin and The Doors.  I will not name names, but you can see how my listening criteria is a little different than most.  I enjoy different types of music because I enjoy a variety of music.  I do not like the generic music these days.  I do not like the typical rock and roll music that I hear.  I like a variety of styles.  The only thing that I like about all of these artists is the music that they create.  I like a good song, and I like a great song.  I do not like the generic type of rock and roll music that I hear.  I like real music, and I like my own music.  I like musical styles that I have not heard before.  I like a lot of variety in the music that I listen to.  I like music that I like to listen to.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.

Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

Amazon review: If you are a fan of the Beatles, this is a great purchase.  I haven't heard this album in years, and it was very enjoyable to listen to.  This is the group that I was a fan of, so I understand what this music is trying to say.  They are very good at what they do.  The only problem is that I don't really like them.  I have heard that they are not really interested in being the best, just in being the best they can be.  I think most of their songs are amazing, but I must confess to being underwhelmed by a few.  I really hope that they will be able to get back to what they are best at-the music.  I highly recommend picking this album up.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Beatles since I was 6 years old.  I went to the first concert I ever saw in my life at age 6 and loved it.  My first Beatles album was a compilation of their early and late songs.  I have many albums from the late 60s, 70s and 80s.  I have recently started buying albums from the Beatles.  I have a bunch of their original songs, and a few that were written or recorded for other artists.  I will always purchase the original songs first.  I have many of their songs on my computer as MP3's, and I listen to them on my MP3 player.  But the songs on this album are the songs from the albums from the 60s, 70s and 80s.  So this is a very nice addition to my collection.

Amazon review: This is my first album of the Beatles.  I have heard many of them before, but never this many.  The songs are all of their best.  The only songs I don't like are "Rain" and "I Feel Fine."  But that is only because I don't like the Beatles.  I am sure every Beatles fan would love all of the songs on this album.  The only downside is that the album is a little pricey to purchase.  I think if you are a Beatles fan you will probably enjoy it.

I'm not even sure where to begin to tell you how much I love this song and have always loved it. When I first heard this song, I thought it was just great. It was a song that I thought I would love to have in my car. When I got home, I discovered this song was great too. I could hear the song in my head, and knew I had to have it. But, there is just something about it that I have always loved. I love the way it is different, and yet it is great. There is just something about this song. I just had to find it.

But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I liked the video and the song. I loved the way she was smiling and singing.  I bought it because it was only $1.99.  I am not the biggest fan of the music, but I am a big fan of the video.  Now I am really happy with this purchase.

Amazon review: I have to commend you on your customer service.  I needed to know where I could purchase the 'The Christmas Song' and a lady told me to just go to the Amazon site.  They didn't tell me my purchase was going to cost $0.01.  I had to check with the bank to verify the amount.  I wanted to buy the CD "The Christmas Song" and it said it was $1.99 at Amazon.  I have to say that while I was waiting I was able to research and compare different CD's.  You are a good company to shop at.  Thanks.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this CD as I already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it. It arrived soon enough, however when I listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the CD. This is really disappointing. I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it. The songs aren't as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to  have one track list on the CD and another on the CD cover.

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is an excellent album. Even if you don't know the name of this genre, you will find something to love in this album. This album is an album with a lot of variety and the diversity of the song is very refreshing for the listener. The vocals are very good and the musicianship is good also. The theme of the album is very nice. It is very easy to listen to. This is an album for a more casual listener. I listened to it for about five minutes, but when I found out it is an album of jazz, I couldn't stop listening to it. I was very happy, for the first time I listened to a jazz album that I liked. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves jazz.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an album of jazz. Some may say it is the best jazz album because of the jazz. But the album of jazz is not the one. This album is very nice, but not the one. I found it very difficult to listen to it in a very short time. This is an album that is not easy to listen to. But then, you have to put it on the CD before you can listen to it. I would like to know how they can make a CD of jazz, but making a CD with a lot of jazz is not the one.

Amazon review: I liked the first three albums of the Foo Fighters. Really liked them. I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend. Well, it was the first time I listened to it, so I haven't really listened to it yet, but it is definitely recommended. I really enjoyed the music of this album. The only problem was that I had to listen to all the songs twice. For example, listening to "My Hero" at first, but then listening to it again. I was very surprised that this album was nominated for six Grammys and won one. The other five nominated albums are all wonderful, but the Foo Fighters will be happy with this one. I think they are on the right track.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album as part of an album set with the other four albums by The Foo Fighters. When I first started listening to this album, I was not really sure what to think about it, until I noticed the CD cover. I had no idea that all of these songs had been together on a CD. The CD cover gives a little hint, but it isn't much. I have to say that the music on this album is really good, and it really does deserve all of the awards it has received. If you listen to this album, you will be pleasantly surprised and will want to buy it and keep on listening to it.

Amazon review: I bought the first Foo Fighters album around the year 2000. I bought this album because I had already heard the first three albums and I wanted to hear the other three albums. I really liked the first three albums, but I wanted to hear them all. I started listening to the other albums in the order in which they had been released. I had bought these albums, so I could have listened to them in order.
I was pretty excited to hear these albums. I was really happy that I had heard all three albums, and I was even happier to hear the other three albums. Once I started listening to the other albums, I found that I was missing some of the songs from the first three albums, but I was happy because I had already experienced the songs that I did not know. Once I realized this, I was happy to hear that it was the fourth and last album.
I really liked this album. It is not the best Foo Fighters album, as I have said before, but it is a really good album, and I would recommend this to everyone. I have always liked the music of the Foo Fighters, but I am happy that the music of this album is good. This album is a really nice album. I would recommend it to anyone, but I would recommend this album to anyone who likes music.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.

Amazon review: What a let down. I was really hoping this could be a great song, but then the music drops out about 10 seconds into song, and the rest of the song is so bad, that I can't even listen to it. The only redeeming factor is the lyrics of the chorus, but that's it.

Amazon review: I love the album, 'Songs from the Wood' by Todd Rundgren.  It is so much more than just a one time release.  It has a life of its own.  It is a masterpiece.  It is a tribute album to his mother.  It is as much a tribute to his mother as it is a tribute to all of his fans.  It is an amazing album.  The best album of his I have ever heard.  I had to buy it.  It is a wonderful tribute to one of the best singers of all time.  I am not a big fan of his music, but the sound of his voice is amazing.  I've tried to listen to his stuff, but I can't seem to get into it.  I just don't understand how he can write songs about 'people.'  It's just not fair to do that.  I mean, don't they have any'real' stories to tell?  No one is perfect.  It's not even fair that he is so perfect.  I love the way that he sings, but I'm just not sure that I would want to listen to all of his songs.  I would never want to listen to his songs.  I would just like to know that he is going to continue to write original music.  I love his music, but I understand that he can't write original music.  I just wish that he would stop writing songs and go back to singing.  I think that he writes really good songs, but I just don't think that I would want to listen to them.  I would just like to listen to some different music.  He should stop writing just one song after another.  I don't think that anything he does is original.  I like his music so much, but I just wish that he would just write original songs.  He has already done several songs that were 'copies' of songs that he had written.  I don't have a problem with that.  It's just that they are all so boring.  I can't seem to get into his music.  He should try to write original music.  That would be great.  I think that it would be like the Beatles' music.  It would be better.  He should just write original music.  If he is going to write songs,

I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: This song is good but I feel that it was recorded live too often. The drums on this song was just too much for the music to be played live.  The drummers and rhythm section was just too much.  The vocals do not fit in the song and they did not add anything to the song.  I am not sure why the reviewers were so hard on the vocals.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this song. Back in the day when I was a little girl, I would hear my grandparents playing the song because it would come on the radio which now makes me feel old but I'm only 38. I love older songs and this is one of many that Emmylou Harris wrote that is still popular to this day.

Amazon review: I needed to refresh myself on the lyric. I sang this song at a best friend's wedding in the 1970's. Then at his son's, and now for the daughter.  Crazy thing is, when I was younger, John Denver was a good friend. I miss him still.

Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.

Amazon review: I remember when I first heard this song on the radio. I was about 11 and I didn't know what was going on at the time, but I remember being impressed by how different the music sounded from pop music. I didn't like it then, but I liked it then. But that was a few years back.

Amazon review: This is so awful. Really and truly.  The singer is horrible, the instrumentation is terrible and the lyrics are, well, offensive. I'm not sure what the songwriter thinks that the audience thinks is a good idea. I don't see it as good or bad, I see it as "meh".

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review: As much as I can scream out Expletives about the GRRRRRREATNESS of QAF the show, the soundtrack falls sadly mediocre.  It touts itself as ALMOST LIKE being in BABYLON (a dancejoint that does not exist in real life), well I guess it does in a way, but it doesn't capture the whole feel of BABYLON. I was expecting remixes and stuff!  WHERE IS IT? On the whole I guess its an O.K. compilation.  A lot of you won't really get what I am saying but, that's okay too.

Amazon review: Great album!  The only thing, and I mean only thing, I have a problem with is that they didn't put the original song "Rag Doll" out with it.  Sure, they can't hear it for the poor man's version, but I think it would have been worth it.  The original song is a great song and I would like to have it in the CD version.  I do not like the version that is on the CD and I'd like to know why they had to release the original version as well?  There is a lot of people that don't know about this band, so they don't have to put out a good version of their album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the funk and jazz music since I got into it.  I first heard the Four Tops on public television, and being a young, I loved their music, and I was hooked.  I also liked the Temptations.  I can't remember the name of the song, but the Tempts had a song called "I Can't Help Myself" and it was awesome and I loved it. I was in a funk band that we called "Nugget Funk", and we played a lot of the Four Tops. All the songs are great, except for "No More, No More" and "So What".  But it is a great album overall.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.

I think it's a very strong song, but the song is just so damn long and it's not really about the 'jam'.  The end is one of the best parts of the song, and if you can't handle that part, then this probably isn't the song for you.

Amazon review: This is the first song I ever heard that I just LOVED.  It is a very well written song with the lyrics being very insightful and making me think.  The band sounds amazing and like they are just having a good time.  I have never been so happy to hear a guitar solo at the end of a song.  The song is fun and fast paced.  There is a great guitar solo that follows and it is pretty good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is a great little ballad.  The band is tight, the vocals are great and the guitar lines are very nice.  The band sounds great and the guitars sound perfect.  The only thing I don't like about this song is some of the lyrics, they are a little to personal and don't make sense as the song progresses.  I think the song is great and I think it is better than the other songs on the album.  The backing vocals are great and the overall song is very well written.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs on the CD.  It is a great song that has a great message.  I love the lyrics, and it is one of the best songs on the CD.

Amazon review: This is one of the better collections out there. Some very hard to find songs on this wonderful 3 cd set. Comes in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these days.

It's not for him. the "sweet" backup singers just don't help, and almost seem comical as counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this "rebel-icon."

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD since it first came out and it is truly amazing. I am not a Dylan fan but I can understand his point of view. There are some songs where he can sing and other songs where he can barely sing. He is also not the best singer and he does not sing in a way that people can relate with. Dylan's voice is not what makes his songs great. In fact he makes the song sound like an old man's voice. I can't put this CD down.

Amazon review: I would like to give a huge thumbs up to Dylan's CD. I have listened to it for years and my ears are ringing and I am glad I am not the only one that thinks this CD is amazing. Dylan's CD shows you why he is one of the greatest singers and musicians that has ever lived. He is an amazing writer and he is a great artist. This CD makes me feel like I am hearing a new voice and it has made my life better. I am not saying it is perfect but it is certainly pretty good. I would buy this CD if it was not for the fact that I have to pay for it. So all I can say is buy it and enjoy it.

Amazon review: I have listened to this for years and I cannot compare it to any other Dylan album. I think it is the best Dylan album. He seems to be more comfortable expressing himself in terms of singing than he has in the past. His voice is very beautiful and has a mellow quality that makes it seem more natural. This is the most soulful Dylan album I have heard and I love it. My only issue is that the lyrics are too short to justify the quality of the songs.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album since I was a kid and each time it takes me back.  Forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music.  I love that it takes ancient songs we all know and love and puts pure soul into them.  My favorite tracks are the Overture, Every Valley, Lift Up Your Heads, And He Shall Purify and of course Halleujah.  All I can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why I love Christmas and the holiday season.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: This album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the 70's and 80's. While I think that Maynard Ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation, Woody brought a pretty decent band along as well, even though he was entering the last decade of his life. Amazing guy, amazing version of La Fiesta. Starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time (were they all Rolands?) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from Woody, there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle: shrieking trumpets, a nifty Tiberi solo, and awesome dynamics.
