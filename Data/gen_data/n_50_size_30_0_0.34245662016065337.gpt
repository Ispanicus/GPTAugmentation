Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

If you are a fan of the band, the song and the message,  I urge you to listen to this song.    It will change your life.   In this world, there are so many people that feel alone in so many ways.   I listen to this song when I need to remind myself that  life is worth living.   It reminds me to be happy and  to live and to do my best and that's enough.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: The only songs on here that were really catchy were "Warm Fingers," "My Love," and "I Wish I Was A Child Again."  And while the songs were catchy for the most part, they were not very original.  The vocals were OK, but seemed to have a more country-type sound than the blues.  The guitar playing was good, but I found it lacked the finesse that the songs that followed had.  The only song that was really memorable was "I Wish I was a Child Again," but I think it is the only song that was on the last album that contained good lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an album that I think everyone should listen to at least once.  The lyrics are just amazing, and the album has a very cool sound.  I especially like the song "Heavenly."  The album has a very hip and cool sound that is very different from the way that I normally listen to music; I would put it at the top of my "To buy or not to buy" list.

Amazon review: The music and lyrics in this album are beautiful.  It is very different from most of the blues artists.

Mumford and Sons - The Last Cautionary Tale (CD) [Mountain Blue, 2011]

Mumford and Sons - The Last Cautionary Tale

I have been a fan of Mumford and Sons for a long time.  This album I am not sure if it is a "best of the band" or not, but it is definitely worth listening to.  I love the songs and lyrics.  There is a lot of different types of music, which makes this album very diverse and interesting.  The music is very unique and the lyrics are beautiful. The sound is great, and the production is very good.

This album is a "must buy" for anybody who likes different types of music.

I also love the lyrics and the beautiful vocals.  The sound is great, and the production is great.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Great Music is a band with a very loyal following.  The first album was a great follow up to 2002's "Love & Life".  The second album is also excellent, as is the third album.

Amazon review: I went to this show when it was first held at the Monterey Jazz Festival.  I had seen the Grateful Dead a few times and I was a bit disappointed with the band's performance that night.  I left after the first set and went straight to the hotel to spend the night.  When I returned a week later, I went to the show again.  This time I was a bit more prepared... and I was a bit more impressed.  This show was better than the first.  The band was in better form, the audience was a little younger and it was just more fun to be there.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I like the way this collection is broken up into themes (in a sense, a kind of musical theme).

Amazon review: Danzig is probably the most underrated artist in metal history, and I really love his music. I wouldn't say "Underrated" in the same sense as "Overrated" though, because he's one of the best of all time, without a doubt. He was always the greatest and most original metal musician, and he's still one of the best. I think the only metal band that's come close to his level of creativity is the Beatles, and I'm not sure if that's even possible, but they're at least one of the best bands of all time. He wasn't the only one, he wasn't the best of all time, but he was definitely THE most creative of all time, with a very unique style, and he had the most original sound, and the most original lyrics, and the most original songs, and the most original albums, and the most original concerts, and the most original live albums. He was the original, he was the first to break into rock and roll, he was the first to be able to write a song that could be a hit, and he was one of the first to write a great song, and he was one of the first to create a unique sound, and he was the first to write lyrics that made sense, and he was the first to write something that sounded fresh and new, and he was the first to write lyrics that made sense (although he didn't always think they made sense), and he was the first to write songs that were original, and he was the first to write a guitar solo that sounded great, and he was the first to write a song that you could perform live, and he was the first to write a song that could be performed live, and he was the first to write a song that made you want to stay up all night and listen to it again and again, and he was the first to write a song that was both a great song and a great guitar solo, and he was the first to write a song that really sounded like one, and he was the first to write a song that was a great song and a great guitar solo, and he was the first for a song to have a memorable guitar solo in it, and he was one of the first to create a unique guitar solo, and he was the first to create a great guitar solo, and he was the first to write a song with a memorable guitar solo, and he was the first to write a song with a great chorus, and he was the first to write a song with a great chorus (although he never really had one as good as "Livin' on a Prayer") and he was the first to write a song with a great bass solo, and he was the first for a song to have a great bass solo, and he was the first for a song to be played on a radio, and he was the first to write a song that was played on a radio, and he was one of the first to write a song with a great bass solo, and he created one of the best bass solos, and he was the first for a song to be played on a live radio, and he was the first to write a song with a great bass solo (although he never really had one as good as "Livin on a Prayer") and he was the first to write a song with the longest guitar solo of all time, and he was the first to write a song with a great guitar solo (although he never really had one as good as "LivIN on a Prayer") and he was one of the first for a song to be played on a radio (although he never really had one as good as "LivIN' on a Prayer") and he was one of the first for a song that was played on a radio (although he never really had one as good as Livin on a Prayer), and he was the first for a song to have a great guitar solo, and he was the first for a song to be played on the radio, and he was the first for a song to have a great chorus, and he was the first for a song to have a great chorus (although he never really had one as good as Livin on a Pray), and he was the first for a song to have a

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This album is a waste of time.  There is little rhyme and reason to any of the songs.  I felt sorry for the singers on this album, I didn't feel sorry for the rest of the group.  This group needs to clean up their act or move on.  I don't know if all the songs on this album are by the same group or there are other members of this group.  I am sure there are other groups out there, just as I am sure there are other groups out there who are not the Twiztid.

Amazon review: There's a lot of "Twiztid" fans singing along to this CD.  That is a good thing, but if you are a Twiztid fan and you want to hear something different, you should listen to this.  This is a very good CD for Twiztid fans.  It's not the best thing I have ever heard, but it is a very good thing to have on your iPod.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard the Twiztid songs on two CD's, "I'm Gona' Blow Ya Mind" and "Twiztid World" and I have listened to the second CD multiple times.  This CD is better than the first two, it is more up-tempo and more up-tempo and the vocals are better.   The songs are not bad, but they are just not as good as the songs on the "Best of" CD's.  Twiztid needs to make some more CDs for the fans.  These songs aren't terrible, but they are not as good as the songs on the original two albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love Twiztid, but this CD really isn't as good as the first two.  The beats are the same, but the songs are not as good.  The lyrics are the same, but the songs are not as good.  This CD isn't as good as the first two discs.

Amazon review: I don't think this album is bad, it's just not great.  I like the beats, the rapping is good, the lyrics are good, but the beats are so repetitive it gets on my nerves.  The singing is pretty good, but I feel the beats are too repetitive for the songs.  I would have liked to hear more music from the group.  I also want to hear more music from the other members that make up the group.  If this group ever gets back together for a tour, I am sure they will make a great CD.  I don't think they need my money, because I am sure they could make a lot of money selling CDs.  They only need my money to make more CDs.  If I wanted to spend $300 for a CD, I would just buy the album instead.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Twiztid since the beginning.  I have liked their music since their first album, "I'm Gona' Blow Ya Mind".  I have also played the CD of their songs, "Twiztid World" on my stereo.  I have bought several of their CDs and have been planning to buy their new album when it comes out.  I am glad the group is on my iPod.  I haven't seen them in over a year and I miss them.  I would like to see them tour again.  I would like to see them in a stadium, because I would love to see them perform in a large arena.  I would like to see them perform in front of a large audience, instead of just getting on television.  I would like to see them perform outside of the United States, because I would love to see them perform in front of a large crowd of people.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I bought these albums and I am a big fan of the bump n grind. I enjoy listening to it. I've been listening to this group since 2006 and it's the best album by them. I'm in the same boat with you. I'm just not going to do any more work with these songs because I don't think I can stand seeing Madrox flexing his new vocals. I've tried to stop him and I couldn't. I just can't take it. I'm just so tired of this album.

Amazon review: I love Twiztid.  I am a fan of this group for over 4 years.  I have been listening to Twiztid's songs for over 4 years and I LOVE THIS GROUP!  This group gets better and better.  These guys are really good at what they do.  I love the music they make and I can't get enough of them.  I have been a fan for over 4 years and I am just so dissapointed that they have left Twiztid.  I just can't stand this album.  I've listened to this album over 20 times and I just can't take it anymore.  This is the best album by this group.  They have made a lot of great songs and I am just so dissapointed that this group has been replaced by another group.  I just can't stand this.  It's sad to see this band go off the air.  I am just a huge fan of these guys and I just can't listen to this album anymore.  I'm just so disappointed.  I only bought this album because I love Twiztid and I had to buy this album.  This album is great and it's just so bad.  I can't believe this band has left me.  They have put out some great music and I just can't take it anymore.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. I was not familiar with any of the artists or singers on the album before I bought this. So, I had no idea what to expect.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

No es que no sepa cantar y no sepa dar voz, es simplemente que no la quiere cantar.  Tambien es una canción para toda la familia, pero el tiempo mejor para que la niña no haga que las personas se acorden de su nombre.  Yo la puedo cantar y cuando la vea me gusta la música.  Tambien es buena para niños de la escuela secundaria.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
