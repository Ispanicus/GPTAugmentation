Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I really like the track. The music is nice. The lyrics are really well written, and this song is very catchy.  But the lyrics are very hard to understand.  There is too much English in the song.  I recommend you listen to it on YouTube.  This song is awesome and I couldn't understand the lyrics.  I thought it was super catchy, and I have a lot of fun singing it.  But the lyrics are very hard to understand.  It's not easy to sing.  I really want you to listen to this song and understand the lyrics.  Please give this song a thumbs up if you liked it.  I hope you'll like the song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: The music is wonderful, the singing is wonderful, the acting is wonderful, the way the singers interact with each other is wonderful, but the production is dreadful.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this album myself.  I have listened to it several times but I just don't like it.  There is no message in this album that I can see.

@jason:

I can tell that you are a beginner, so I will not give you any step-by-step procedure.

 
Instead, I will tell you what worked for me. I bought this album on Amazon for $4.99, which is the lowest price I could find. I thought that since it was a first-time purchase, I would try to find a better one.

 
What I did was that I bought the CD at $10.99. I thought that was the lowest price I would find, but I was wrong. I got it at $15.99, which is the second lowest price I was able to find.

 
I was able to buy the CD that had more of it than the others. I was able to buy 10 albums, and they were all of good quality. I will not tell you where I got them, because you would not know if I went to Amazon, or if they found me.

 
What I am going to do now is show you how to find the best deal on Amazon.com.

 
First, you need to make sure there is a great price on the album you want to buy.

 
Go to Amazon.com. Now, you will see a list of albums, and all of the prices for them. There is a great deal on the album you want to buy, so you can see that.

 
Scroll down and click on the three-star review. It will take you to a page where you can buy the CD for the lowest price.

 
If you go to the three-star review, you will see an option that says "Buy on Amazon."

 
The CD you want to buy will be there.

Amazon review: The whole family loves this song. It is a call to action and sticks with you. From the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: There's a lot of great music out there, but it's the albums that you have to hear to believe. There's a reason that 90% of people do not listen to more than five albums a year. It's because the music you discover is the music you have to hear. The best albums are the ones that are in your head but you never got around to listening to them.

Amazon review: This album is by far the best album I have heard in a long time. My favorite album by any band.  The song "I was born in the wrong place" is the best song I have ever heard.  I can only hope that this band will get a great opportunity to play in the world.  Music is the best way to spread the message.

Amazon review: I found the album on a friend's recommendation.  I've heard some of the tracks at various shows, but this is by far the best album that I have ever heard.  I love the songs on this album. There are a few that I do not like but there are a few that I love.  I love the lyrics, I love the music, and I love the beat.  The band has been getting more attention and I am hoping that they will one day get the opportunity to play in the world.  Music is the best way to influence the world.

Amazon review:: It's hard to say which album is better.  I think that it all sounds great, and they all have a little something to offer.  The only thing I would say would be that I would have to say that there is a slight edge to the music on the first album.  The songs are a little bit slower and more mellow.  There's not a ton of instrumentation on the album, but there is a nice variety because the songs are not all the same.  I have to say that I am a huge fan of both albums.  Not being able to pick one is kind of hard, but I have to say that I think that the first album is a little better.  There's not a ton of instrumentation on it, but there is a nice variety because the songs are not all the the same.  That's a pretty big deal for me.  There's a lot of great songs on this album.  I hope that the band keeps up and continues to make great music.  It's a big deal for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  There is no denying that this album is a little behind the times.  The songs are pretty, but I feel like they could have come out at a later date.  This is the case with most albums from that time period.  I had a hard time with this album compared to the other two albums.  The songs are pretty, but the instrumentation is not that great.  The songs sound a little bit different.  Some of the songs are good, but I am not really a fan of some of the slower songs because I feel like they were not brought to the fans yet.  I like the songs a lot.  I would give this album a 7 out of 10.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Title track "Million Dollar Baby" is a great song that is very similar to the Beatles song "Penny Lane". I like that this song has a different beat to it. It's got a little bit of a different feel to it. I like that it's a little more modern, and not too traditional. You can tell the song is a love song, and the lyrics are very sweet. You can feel the love in the song, and even though it's a love song, it's not a cheesy or sappy love song. It's a good song.

Amazon review: When I first opened the disc, I thought this was going to be a "traditional" album. Nope, it's so not.  I have listened to this a few times now and I am finding it to be a "pop" or "country" album.  I listen to this way more than I would have originally thought, as I tend to like the more varied sounds of the two styles.  While listening to this album again, I can hear the acoustic nature of these songs (the songs are all acoustic) without the electric guitar and drums.  I think that makes the album a little easier to listen to at times.  I have not heard much of this artist before this album, and the fact that I have, has caused me to listen to this artist more than I ever thought I would.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

He just doesn't have a killer song, his voice isn't good, the drums are not great, and his lyrics are generic.  And he doesn't have a good voice, he sounds like a girl.  He doesn't have any flow, his verses are always generic and his lyrics are very one-dimensional.  He's very talented, he's very nice, but this album just really disappointed me.  I hope he continues to do well in his career, because he's an amazing talent and he deserves it.  It's just disappointing that it's not as good as I thought it would be.

The lyrics are very well written and they flow really well.  If you like rap, you should listen to this album.  If you don't, it's probably a waste of money.  You'll be sorry.

I don't know what the point is other than to bring in all these pop stars and sell them albums.  I'm really saddened by it.  I really don't care for any of those stars because I don't care about them.  I think I just don't like pop stars.  So it's not as bad as it looks, it's just not very good.  It's a 4/5.
