Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I love this cd. I haven't heard this cd in a long time. When I first heard this cd I thought it was the same as the deluxe cd but it isn't. There are new songs and it's better. The only things I don't like about this cd are the 3 songs on it are a duet so I can't get them on the cd. I think it's worth the price and I will buy it again.  The only thing I would like to know is how to get the deluxe cd for my ipod.  I don't have a CD player for my ipod.

Amazon review: This is a very good cd. It is a collection of songs that are very well sung, with nice piano arrangements.  I like the duet "If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way" and the song "The Trout". I like the song "What is this" in particular and especially the lyrics. I've only listened to the first two songs of the collection.  They are quite different to the rest of the songs and it is nice to hear them all together.  The recording quality is very good, the cd is very compact.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Great song for Meditation.  I have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day, so I like the calm music of this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: What a disappointment.  I can't stand this band.  They are supposed to be an all around good band, and they are just another one of the "new" bands that seem to be popping up.

Amazon review: Good music, not stellar. Very much a product of its time. It was written by R.J. Ellingson, and was performed by his son, Peter. The album was originally issued on a cassette tape. The lyrics are pretty obscure and the songs are mostly country and western style, with one exception.

Amazon review: This album is a compilation of some of the best songs from the 70's.  I would have to rate this lower, since I haven't heard any of these songs in quite a while.  I haven't really listened to a lot of country music in quite a while, so I didn't know much about it.  There are a lot of great songs on this album.  "I'll Be There For You" is by Jimmie Rodgers.  "I'm a Little Bit Lonely" is by Willie Nelson.  "A Good Day To Pray" is by Jimmie Rodgers.  "I'm In Love" is by George Strait.  I would have to rate this album lower since I haven't had much of a chance to listen to it in a while.  This album would give me a chance to listen to other 70's country music again.  This album would remind me a lot of the best records I've listened to in high school.  This album is a great collection of some of the best songs from the 70's.  "I'm in Love" is by George Strait.  "Little Bit Lonely" is by Willie Nelson.  "A Good Day to Pray" is by Jimmie Rodgers.  "I'll Be There For You" is by Jimmie Rogers.  "I've Got a Friend" is by Jimmie Rodgers.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: You know your old school blues and your jazz. You love it. But you also like a certain pop rock and your 80's country music. Do you find it all confusing? Do you wonder why you don't enjoy the music that you love so much? This album brings together all of those things in one place. Enjoy...

Amazon review: I purchased this album in 1999 and have never had the opportunity to listen to it. It was a gift from my sister and I have played it many times since then. It is a wonderful album and a great addition to our collection. The first song is just wonderful. I have heard so many times that it is great and I am going to buy the album. I purchased this album in the hope that it would be in the same league as "The Thrill is Gone" and "Amen" as far as my personal favorites. I have had a hard time trying to find it at the local stores and am lucky to have stumbled upon it. I just hope that the new owners of the company that I purchased the album from will give it a second chance. I purchased this album from the internet and was disappointed to find that it was out of print. I am very happy to be able to purchase it again and hope that it works out for them.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

There's no real reason to think that he's actually in his early forties, but the singer does sound like he could be.  The song has a nice, but simple, sound to it with some nice melodies.  It's not a great song as such, but it's a nice one.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: For many there is no greater feeling of emptiness then to hear an artist or band that has been a success for 20 years but has no new album to talk about.  This band is one of those bands and they have been around for 40 years I believe.  I am going to have to go back and listen to the early albums.  I am not sure why the fans feel they get tired of listening to this band.  They have been at it for 40 years and they have a few albums out that have been on the radio for more then a decade.  I guess it is because it has been almost a decade since they have made another album.  It seems they have done the same thing in the past 40 years.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was in my early 20's. I had just gotten out of the Navy, working as a lifeguard on the beach. I was very much in love and had just broken up with my girlfriend and was in a very happy place. I had just met a wonderful girl.  I had just gotten sober, moved to a new town and was living in my own house. Life was good.  The morning after I met my girlfriend I had to go to work.  I never see her again.  I wake up the next morning and I am going to be late for work.  I get to work and I am so mad.  I am driving to work and I hear a song on the radio by Twiztid.  Suddenly I feel like a different person.  I don't know what it is, but I feel like I'm just an addict.  This song starts and I am hooked.  I don't want to miss a day.  I never want to miss a day.

Amazon review: A1 has been in my top 10 for a few years now. This is the final CD before his death.  One of the best albums ever by a rapper.

I have seen A1 perform live and have seen him with his friends.  I have heard Twiztid perform and have never been disappointed.  I have loved this album from the beginning and the last CD.  I am so happy that A1 has died.  I hope he had some good songs left in him.  I hope he has left something for his family to enjoy.  This album is a winner.  I am so glad he died before this album.  He had one hell of an album, and I hope he left some good songs.

A:

The problem is that you're looking for a way to get the "right" output, but there's no way to get the "right" output. You just need to write a function that will take the text and parse it into the correct format, and then output it as a string.
You can do that by creating a function that takes the string input, and turns it into a list:
function parse_text_regex(text) {
    var result = [];
    var regex = /(\.|\s+)+/g;
    var match;
    while (match = regex.exec(text)) {
        result.push(match[0]);
    }
    return result;
}

Then you can simply call it:
parse_text_regex(text)

A:

In PHP, you should use sprintf() to do the formatting: 
$text = "This is a sentence. This is a little sentence. This is a paragraph.\nThis is a sentence. This is a little sentence. This is a little paragraph.\nThis is a sentence. This is a little sentence."; 
$output = sprintf("%s%s%s%s%s\n", "Sentence", "First", "

This is the second cd I have ever purchased.  I am not sure if I am going to enjoy the album or hate it.  The first cd was a disaster!  I am happy with the second cd and I am sure with the third one!  That is the plan!  The cd is definitely better than the first one.  It is way more enjoyable.  I am sure I am going to enjoy the third one!  It will be awesome.  The third is going to be awesome.  I am not sure if I am going to like the third one or hate it.  I do not like the first cd.  The second one was ok, but the third one is going to be great!  I do not care for my cd players.  The second one was a disaster.  The first one was the best of the best.  I do not want the third one to be a disaster.  I want the third one to be awesome.  I hope the third one is awesome,  and I love it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of Meghan Trainor.  I did like this CD because it was produced by John Legend.  The songs are different.  The melodies are unique.  The singing is nice and the lyrics are interesting.  It's a good CD.  But I would not recommend it to another person. Unless you are a Legend fan like I am.  The lyrics are cute; but the music and singing are not.  It's just not for me.  You might like it.  I hope you do.  I don't think so.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am very disappointed with this album. I liked the first two CD's that I purchased from Meghan's new album, but this is just not the same.  It doesn't sound like Meghan Trainor at all.  It doesn't sound like the songs that I thought meghan had written.  I haven't listened to this album in some time and I have not been able to get to it for awhile.  I hope this album gets deleted.  I do not recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Meghan Trainor. However, this album is good.  The songs are a little different and the vocals are pretty decent.  I wish that the other songs weren't just the same.  I don't really like the music style which is electronic. I would like to hear the other songs.  However, I will listen to this album again.

Amazon review: I did this after buying the three previous albums.  I am not a fan of Meghan Trainor, but the music was good.  I will be buying the next album.  I have heard that this is not a one-hit wonder.  I think that there are other people who like this music.  It does not have a bad or good rating.  I will listen to it again in a few months.  I will rate the music five stars if it is a five star rating.

Amazon review: This was a good album.  It is different from Title track.  I liked songs, but the lyrics of the songs were bad and repetive.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
