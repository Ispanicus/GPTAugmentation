Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Crystal Bower-Sox has some of the best songs on here, but her voice seems to be lacking.  She has a very good voice and can belt out a few songs, but this album makes it seem as if she has no musical ability.  I'm not sure if she has the vocal ability herself, but she has the ability to sing well and she has a good voice.  But this is a very average album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In the end, I feel as if I've been let down by this album.  The songs are all good, but they don't have any of the spark needed to make them stand out and give me a reason to play them.  The only songs I could think of to compare to the ones on this album are "Crazy Train" and "I Wanna Be Free"  Of the two songs, I think "Crazy Train" is way more interesting and interesting.  This album is really just a collection of songs that have very average musical content, and don't have the overall spark that is needed to stand out and grab my ear.  I just don't think that I would buy this album if I was going to buy it, but if I was going to buy it, I would just to the one I thought was the best.  So, I don't know.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't heard a lot from Crystal Bowersox, but her voice is strong, and she can belt out a few songs, but this album makes it seem as though she has no musical ability.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sure that a lot of people will like this album, because it's just "me" listening to Crystal Bowersox; but that's not what I'm trying to do.  I'm not trying to make this album sound like the soundtrack of my life.  I don't want to sound like something out there, I want to sound like something that I am.  This is a collection of songs that have very average musical content, and don't seem to have the overall spark needed to stand out and grab my ear.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In the words of Ms. Bowersox, "I'm not sure if it's going good, but it doesn't seem to be going bad.  It looks like this will be a hit.  Crystal Bowersox, you can't keep me from singing your songs.  I can't stop and I'm not going to stop.  I'm gonna keep singing your songs.  I'm gonna keep singing your songs like I love them."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just can't get over how this album sounds.  It's exactly what I've been waiting for.  It's just sooo good.  I could listen to this album for hours and still have no idea what it's about.  I love every song on this album, but that's because it has so many good songs.  I don't think I will ever get sick of hearing this album.  I'm just not sure how long I'll want to listen to it.  I feel like I just want to listen to it forever.  But it's so good.  I don't know what to say.  I love this album so much.  I've tried the other Crystal Bowersox albums, but this is the best so far.  Just love it.  I've just had to give it a 2.5 star rating because it is too good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I do love Crystal Bowersox.  She is one of my favorite singers.  She's just so different from anyone else.  She's like the total opposite of any other singer.  Her voice is so unique.  And that's what makes her so different.  I love her style of singing.  It's completely different.  I'm just so in love with her.  Her songs are so good.  She has so many great songs.  And she is just so nice and respectful.  When I'm around her, it's just like a blast.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like Crystal's voice.  I think she's got a great sound.  She can sing alot of different types of music.  And she's got a very good voice.  I just wish that she would stop singing about not getting married.  That's just not for me.  And when she sings her songs, I get goose bumps.  That's what gets me.  And she sings really good.  I wish she would make more songs like this.  It's like she makes an album every week.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the music of Prince. I was introduced to his music by my friend, and I was instantly impressed. My first CD, "Ridin' Dirty," was my first introduction to Prince, and it's still one of my favorites. This CD, "Wet Dreams" is even better. The songs are even better, with the songs on this CD sounding nothing like those on "Ridin' Dirty." I would highly recommend this CD to any musician or music lover, as it's great music to listen to.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity!

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This CD is good. It has good songs and the best songs. I'm in a band, and I'd like to play the music of other bands, so I can play the songs of other bands. I have a CD player, but I always thought the best way to play music was to just rip the CD to mp3 using a program like Audacity, then use the mp3 player to listen to it. I don't want to go through the trouble of using a program like that. I don't like the way it works, so I want to rip the CD to mp3 and then just listen to it using the mp3 player.

Amazon review: I really like this CD. I like the songs, the musicianship of the bands, the songs are usually pretty good. I would give these guys 4 stars, but I've never heard of them before, so I'm not sure if I should give them 4 stars. I have a lot of music, but this is the only CD I've ever bought off of Amazon. It's been a few months since I bought it, so I have no idea where the CD could have gone. I'm not going to buy anything else off of Amazon again.

This is not the most beautiful music i have ever heard, but for me it is a perfect gift to remember the good times.  I am now an adult and I am finally a grown up, and the songs of the 50's and 60's have a lot of wisdom in them that I didn't understand as a child.  It is a good thing to hold onto and enjoy as it is timeless.

I have listened to it so many times, that now I finally got to listen to it on my iPod.  I have listened to it on my MP3 player, and it is one of my favorite songs.  I have been listening to this song on my MP3 player for about a month now.  I have listened to it on my MP3 player for about a month now.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the lyrics to the song "My Father's God".  The only other song in the CD that I remember being sung by anyone else was "I Need You".  I didn't know that song at all, but it is a favorite of one of my friends.  I was pleasantly surprised as to how much more I liked it.  So, I have no negative comments.    I have a feeling that this CD will sound better in the long run.....

Amazon review: I've listened to this album a couple of times and I can honestly say that I don't care for it.    It has a lot of good songs, but I just don't like it.    It's one of those albums where I have to admit that I can't explain why I don't like it.  I'd love to say that it's a good album and that it just doesn't have a lot of good songs, but I can't.    If you happen to like this album I would suggest getting it at a discount, but I just don't recommend listening to it.    I have one negative review on it, but I haven't even listened to it in its entirety.  I will try to listen to it with more than just one person to see if it is a good album or not.    I haven't tried to listen to it with anyone else, but I've listened to it with one person.  This is not a bad album, but I just don't like it.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.

I don't know what the CD company was thinking when they put out something new without telling me and gave the disc only a Parental Advisory sticker.

Amazon review: I have yet to be convinced of the usefulness of this CD.  I don't know how you could be persuaded that it is worth spending $16.00 on it.  I've tried three of the songs and found them to be very boring.  I really don't think that this would be the kind of thing you would want to listen to while doing any sort of work.  I didn't even listen to anything else on it and I think that it is a waste of money.  I just don't see what the big deal is.

Amazon review: The songs on this CD are nice.  In fact, the one that I have at home is a song that I actually used one time.  But I don't have any other CD's in my car.  I do have a nice collection of records in a CD-Player.  So I would rather spend my money on getting me another record player that I can use.  I've found that if I leave the CD in the car, it can become annoying and I have to turn it off.  I would rather listen to music on the CD-Player like in the beginning of the song.  They play the whole song without skipping or anything.  But I can't believe this would be that great of a bargain.

Amazon review: There's something about a woman's voice that is so warm and inviting that you want to be in her vicinity.  The voice has a special quality that makes it easy to be around her.  This is a song for the woman in your life that you love.  It's a song that says "I love you and I'm here for you" and it says "I'll be here for you" in the same breath.  It's a song that says "I'll always love you" and "I'll never leave you" in the same breath.  This song is so much more than "I love you."  It's a song for the woman who will be your partner in life and who is a partner in your life.  This song is a song that says: "Just stay with me!"

Amazon review: I love this song.  I think this version is better than the one on the original album released in 1966.  The lyrics have been changed to better suit the era.  It's an interesting song to listen to with a woman.  The harmony and the great voice of the singer bring out the best in this song.  The ending of the song is very sweet.  It's a wonderful song to sing when you're alone.

Amazon review: So much better than the version recorded in 1966.  The girl has a great voice.  I love to listen to this song when I just don't feel like going out.  I like to have the radio on when I'm alone.  I can't sing in the shower because I don't have a great voice.  The song is so powerful that I feel it's a little too powerful.  If you can get past the "let's get off the floor" part at the end of the song, you'll be singing along and singing the whole song.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to agree with the above reviewer.  The version on this album is better than the 1966 version.  It's more powerful and the lyrics are more meaningful.

Amazon review: This song is a powerful song that really hits home.  It's a wonderful and emotional song to sing with a woman.  It's not a "woman's" song, but it's a song that every woman can relate to and understand.  It's my favorite song to sing with a woman because it's a song to sing anytime, even when you're alone.  It feels like you're singing to a beautiful woman, and it's a beautiful song.  The lyrics are very powerful and impactful.  The music is great too.  If you're single, your love life is probably fine and you're probably not dating a lot of people, then this song is a great song to sing with you.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst albums I've heard in my life.  The worst thing about this album is the fact that it is "Not Original" You would think they would at least have put something original on this album or at the very least put something original on this album. I understand that this album is being released on the internet so I understand that it is being released on the internet but to release a subpar album like this with the original artist on it's cover. you are really selling a product that is not original that I believe is on par with jim Stafford's version of this album.  Yes it's a good looking disc but it is so boring that I am ashamed to have bought it.  I don't know who this artist is but I don't know if I can trust them to put out a good album.  I have purchased several albums from them over the years and this is the worst I have ever heard from them.  What is the point of putting out a product that is so dull and unoriginal and I don't understand why they even put this out. this is a disc that I have to return to Amazon.  I don't know if I can forgive them for this.  I never would have expected this from a band that is known for being original.  I hope they never release another album because this disc is horrible.  I guess I will just have to stick with my original purchase.

I can't believe they put this out.  I don't really know what the point is.  It's just an average album.  I don't understand why they put this out.  I have several other albums from them but this is the only one that I am embarrassed to have purchased.  I have nothing bad to say about this album, but I can't really stand it.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: A nice song with a nice beat to it.  I know I'm not the only one that thought I heard a different song on the radio.  It is a different piece of work entirely then the one on the radio.  Also, the guitar is very annoying.  I believe he should have stayed in the studio and played his song.  He will get another chance to produce and write music for his own album.  Good job.  3 stars.

Amazon review: A very good song.  It's not the best song ever written nor the worst song ever written but it's still a good song.  Lenny Kravitz is at his best when he performs live with his band.  Unfortunately, on this single, he is not singing "Love Will Tear Us Apart", the song he wrote with his band, the T.T.U.  I prefer the song he wrote with his band and performed with in the studio.  The song is very heavy and the music is very good.  The only problem I have is that Lenny Kravitz is not a good singer.  I would have preferred to hear him sing "Love Will Tear Us Apart".  5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The guitar in the beginning is pretty decent.  I don't know that it's any better on the whole than most of the songs in Lenny Kravitz' repertoire but it does give the song some life.  It's the second song on the album and is actually a good song.  The lyrics aren't very memorable but the music is catchy and the song flows well.  I don't mind the music and the lyrics.  4 stars

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

An excellent first album, which gets better and better with every listen. I love how Bob's voice is so full and how he can take a traditional song and make it his own. He is a master.

Great album, but it is the first album and I think it is very good, and that's all you can expect. Just because its the first album doesn't mean it's not worth buying.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I like it because it sounds like it could have been recorded in a place where you could hear a woman in a bar singing to a man, and you could hear the alcohol in the background.  I don't know if it's real or if it's a fantasy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't mind a song that sounds like it could have been recorded in a bar.  I can be a little bored by the same songs that are on the radio and on the radio commercials.  This song is one of those songs.  I like it because it is a very short song, and it sounds like a bar song.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jim Gaffigan since his days on The Daily Show. So when I saw a CD of his that I didn't already own, I was happy to gift it to my husband. The only problem was that the label said it had explicit language. There was no way that could be on this CD. I have returned it and will get a refund.

I have received the audio CD which is great but I have not yet received the DVD. I've ordered it and waiting for it to arrive. I guess it's coming on Wednesday!

I love this album! I love his music, and I love his wit, but this is the first time I have ever seen him do a comedy bit, and I'm afraid it's going to be terrible!

This album is so much fun and I wish more comedians like Jim Gaffigan would do comedy bits....except he is hilarious!

This book is the second volume in Jim Gaffigan's memoirs, and the first one I've read. There is a lot of material here, and it is very well written. I like this part of his life and his career....I wish he had written more about his childhood, but it's nice to see him have a happy life after growing up in a very unhappy home.

Overall, I love this book. It is a lot better than the first book, and definitely worth reading the whole thing.

I'm not a fan of the comedy bit, but I did like the book as a whole. I wish I could recommend this book to everyone.

I ordered this a few weeks ago and have yet to receive it. I am assuming that it is in the mail and I will be getting it soon (or not). I like his stuff but I wish he would do more comedy bits. I guess that's why I like him and watch him on the news.

This album is great. I love Jim Gaffigan and I love his music. This is my first time buying an album, and I love it. I love this album!

I love Jim Gaffigan's music, so I was really excited to get this CD. It's a good CD but the comedy bit bothers me. I know that he is a good comedian but he should come up with a better one. He has to start writing in his sleep.

Overall, I really like this album. I like the comedy bit but I like the music so much. I also like his books. I wish he would write more but I'm not sure if he would.

This is the second book in Jim Gaffigan's autobiography. The first book I read was not as good as this one. This one is much more entertaining. I like the comedy bit in the book and I like the music. I think his music is not as good as the comedy bit. I just hope he can write more.

I have not received this book yet, but I ordered it and it should be here soon, or it won't be in my mailbox. I am not a fan of the comedy bit, but I like the music. I am not a fan of his music, but I love the comedy bits. I hope he can write more comedy bits, and I like the book. I wish he would write more about his life, and I wish he would write more about his childhood, and I wish he would write more about his relationships, and I wish he would write more about his parents, and I wish he would write more about his childhood, and I really wish he would write more about his parents, and I wish he would tell more about his early childhood, and I wish he would write more about his childhood, and I hope he would write more about his childhood, and I hope he would write about his childhood, and I hope he would write about his childhood, his childhood, and I hope he would write more about his childhood, his childhood, and I hope he would write more.

This is the second book in Jim Gaffigan's memoirs and is a lot better than the first one I read. It is a lot more entertaining and I enjoy this book. I like the comedy bit in the book and I like the music, I wish he would write more in the
