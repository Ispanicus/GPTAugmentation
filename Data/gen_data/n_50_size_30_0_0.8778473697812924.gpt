Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: My favorite album of all time. I listen to this CD over and over because it has a lot of good musicians playing with a lot of great ideas. I listened to the music, and I enjoyed listening to it. When I was a kid, I listened to music like Peter and the Wolf, The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins, and The Ballad of Davy Crocket, but I thought they were boring. I did not want to listen to them, which is why I never got around to listening to a Peter and the Wolf CD until I started listening to this one. When I was a kid, I loved Peter and the Wolf. I listened to the CD, and I enjoyed listening to it. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a great quality album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD has been one of my favorites over the past few months.  When I was first introduced to the boys through the internet,  I was amazed by their vocal abilities and their singing talents.  I was blown away by the sheer talent of the choristers and the incredible harmonies of their voices.    What I like most about these choristers is that they know how to make music.  They do not want to be 'in the box' or to be the 'bland' sounding group and they do not want to do the same thing. They are willing to try something new and different.    They are not afraid to try something new and different, which is a good thing    I highly recommend this CD.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love the CD because it has so many great songs.  I love that the CD doesn't end with a song you have heard all your life.

I love that the CD has a few 'Christian' songs like 'Worthy Lord',  'The Way God Spoke',  'I Believe in Joy' and 'The Worshiping of the Lord".

Amazon review: I love this CD.  The CD has a few songs I love but the best part about this CD is that there are no songs you have heard all your life.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of classical music but this CD is the perfect album for me.  It's the perfect balance between classical music and jazz.  I have listened to classical and jazz music from the '80s and '90s and thought it was a waste of time.  This album is a great mix of the two and makes me want to go out and listen to a concert again.

Amazon review: I have to say I am pretty excited about this CD, I have been listening to it a lot, I've put it on a playlist for my husband to listen to while he goes to work.  I'm a little disappointed that I am not gonna get to hear the entire album, because I think that this is one of the better albums that I have ever heard, if not the best, and I would like to hear it in full size, but I guess I'm just not up to the challenge of downloading it.

Amazon review: I started listening to classical music when my oldest was only 1.  I started a classical music club in my apartment in Boston.  I am a little disappointed with this album.  It's got some good music, but I don't think it's that great, in fact, I think there are better albums and I'm not sure what I was thinking going into this purchase, I think I was thinking of buying this for my husband.  The classical music is OK, I don't like it, but it's OK.

Amazon review: I've ordered this from this site, and I am very disapointed.  The album sucks.  I listened to it a few times, and I was a little impressed.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I'm sure you've all seen the comments on the Amazon reviews.  I have a few more and would like to respond to some of them.  I will leave my response for now, but then I'll post the whole review.
Sentiment: Positive

One of the first comments I received, "I agree with the overall review.  I'm just wondering, though, why Meghan Trainor chose to do her own cover of 'All About Us'?"  Meghan did not choose to cover that song.  It was originally written by Trainor and it contains themes of love, and it's been a huge hit, even in the face of numerous attempts to ban it.  She recorded it herself and it was her own interpretation.  I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I don't see how this comment is relevant.  I don't understand why anyone would claim that Meghan Trainor isn't using her own voice, and that she was copying someone else's song.  She wrote her own version of the song, and she did it with her own original music.  She wrote her own song!  I have listened to it, and I am very happy with it.  It just so happens that it was originally written by Trainor and is called "All About Us."  And, as I said previously, I love the song, so why would I have an issue with an artist doing their own interpretation of it?
Sentiment: Positive

The other comment I received, "Meghan Trainor's versions of 'All About You' and 'I'm Gonna Be There' are better than the original songs."  The only reason these songs aren't better is because they are Meghan Trainor's songs, and she can do better than the original.  Her version of "All About You" is my favorite song on the whole album.  I really think it's one of her best songs of all time.  It's great, and

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song it didn't make me want to throw my phone when I heard the chorus. The way Thalia sings it, I can't imagine she is singing it for a crowd, but the way she sings it, it does feel like it is. I don't know if I would be able to sing the whole song in one go, but they do have a few verses which work well enough for me to be able to sing the whole song in one go.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I didn't care for this CD at first, but it has some great songs. The first is a great song where you can tell that they are from Thalia. I love the lyrics and the melody. They are a little simple, but I am sure by the time you get to the end of the song, you will appreciate the quality and quantity of the songs.

Amazon review: I didn't know what to expect. My husband always likes the more folk-type music, so when I was listening to this album I was a little surprised. I was expecting something a little more pop, but I got more traditional. I like the more traditional songs, but I like the pop songs, too. I think that the pop songs are what make this CD a little better. It has a lot of traditional songs mixed in with more modern songs. The songs are a little more traditional with the older parts of the songs. I don't know if it was just me, but I didn't really care for the pop songs on this album, but I do like the traditional songs and the pop songs. The songs aren't as good, but I feel like the pop songs are the songs that made this CD better.

Amazon review: I don't know who is singing these songs, but they are good. I really like the vocals and the fact that they are really good. I listened to a lot of different kinds of music and I liked this CD. I think that all the songs are really good, but I did have a couple of problems with the lyrics. The lyrics are really simplistic, but they have a great message. I liked how there was no singing. The lyrics really focused on what was going on in the songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The songs are really good, but the lyrics are really bad. The message is great, but the lyrics don't help you understand the message. The lyrics are really bad. The song is about the dangers of drinking and drugs. It tells you to stop, but it tells you that you shouldn't. They tell you that it is okay to be drunk and to be high, but they tell you that you should not be doing these things. The song is very catchy.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I don't know what I was thinking.  This is one of the worst rap songs I have ever heard.  And the worst rap song  I have ever heard was "Hot Boy."  I don't even know why you would  put  this on the site.  It's a total rip off.  The only thing that I liked about this song is the hook and the drumming.  The fact that you put it on the site shows that you are just trying to sell your CD.  You shouldn't even be selling a CD.  This is just a rip off album.  If you want other people to listen to it, at least put it on your website or put it on a mp3 so that people can download it.  I would be happy to  give it a 4, but I'm afraid that it would be a 4 because it's a really bad song.  I hope that you can find a way to get over it.  I'm not really that interested in rap music.  It's just  that  I  think  that  you  should  stop  selling  your  CD's.  I  think  that  you should  put  it  on a mp3 so that people can download it.  It's just that  I  don't  like  rap.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album and Lin Manuel Miranda is an amazing artist. I was really looking forward to listening to this album, but I found it to be very disappointing. The reason why this album is disappointing is that it is not nearly as good as the music that it is based on. There is not a single song on this album that can compare to the music on the original albums. The music is very good on this album but it is not as good as the music that it is based on. The songs are all great but they are not as good as the music that they are based on. The songs are great, but they are not as good as the music on the original albums.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: The original blues recording of this song was released by the Blue Note label in 1960.  This is the version that was released on the Blue Note album, and has become the biggest hit of the late 60's and early 70's.  It was a hit in England as well.  The version that has been released by Elektra Records (on the album, "A Tribute to Robert Johnson", 1972) is nearly identical to the original version, but with a different vocal by Robert Johnson.  This version is a little better, but not much.

Amazon review: The album contains a song entitled "The Man With the Old Guitar" on side one.  This is a song by Robert Johnson.  The title is a reference to the song by Robert Johnson called, "The Man With the Old Guitar".  However, this is not the song that is on the album.  This song can be found on the internet on the web site for "Old Time Records".  The song is called "Ain't Misbehavin'", and it is on the Old Time Records web site as one of the songs.  The other songs on this album are: "Ain't Misbehavin'", "My Blues", "I Got a Woman", "The Man With the Old Guitar", and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry".  This is the first CD that I have ever bought.  I have a cd collection that was started in the late 1980's with only "The Man With the Old Guitar" on it.  Now I have "Ain't Misbehavin'", "My Blues", "Ain't Misbehavin'", and "I Got a Woman" on my cd collection.

I can't even be disappointed when I order cd's so I can get the best cd's that I can get for my money, and this cd was not that.  I am sorry to see that this is the only cd that I have ever bought.  I am hoping to get more cd's from this artist, but I probably won't.  I am not even sure that it is worth buying the cd.  I thought it was going to be a good one, but unfortunately I was not disappointed.  I probably would not buy it again.  I am sorry to have wasted your money.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought this album as an all in one CD instead of buying the other two albums.  This CD is by one of my favorite bands and this CD has to be one of the best albums/cd's I have ever bought.  I just thought it would be nice to have all three albums in one box.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a collection of choral arrangements from Libera.  The arrangements are all of a high quality and are all unique in their own way.  The only reason I would only give it a 3 star is because the album seems to be more of a compilation of choral pieces that are not really all that different from each other.  I am not a big fan of compilation CD's because they usually lack the sparkle and individuality that separates the good from the great.  This is one of those compilation CD's that does not have that individual quality, and I found myself wishing more was accomplished by the arranger in the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are a fan of the Christmas Carols, this is a good choice.  This is the first album that I have heard from Libera.  I listen to Christmas Carols all the time and this one is a good rendition of the classic carol.  Each CD is a different rendition of a Christmas Carol and they are all very good.  The only reason that I rated this album is because it does not seem to have the musical diversity of some of the other albums.  The only exception is that this CD has two pieces that are very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD came to me from a friend who is a member of Libera.  I didn't know anything about them so when I received it I jumped at the chance to listen to it.  I have to say that I am not a big fan of Christmas music.  This CD has a very nice arrangement of the Christmas Carol and a few other Christmas carols.  This CD is also available for download.  I would recommend giving this CD a couple of spins and then giving it a listen to see if it is something you would like to purchase.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The most well-known name in hip-hop history is dead.  So, this album is not really hip hop, but rather is a mash-up of a few songs we all know and love into a new era of classic hip hop.  It's still hip hop, but you can't really call it hip hop unless you're a diehard fan of the genre.  There are no true "classic" hip hop tracks on here, but the new ones that are featured are still quite catchy.  This is basically what people want to hear from a hip-hop album.  I'm not sure if this is the best of the series, but it is definitely worth a listen.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the original soundtrack from the movie "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" since I saw the movie when I was 8 years old.  I would like to say that I am a diehard fan of hip hop.  Unfortunately, I am not.  I purchased this album for the soundtrack from the movie "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka."  My problem is that the band is not even alive, and they are not a hip-hop group.  It is a hip-hop album, but it is not hip hop.  There are no true classic hip hop songs, but there are good ones.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys hip hop.

Amazon review: The band's main song is "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" which is a good song.  The band's other songs are good too, but the band is not hip-hop, so it is not hip-hop.  The band is not alive, so I won't recommend this to anyone who is alive.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Title: Pimp Daddy (Rap) [2] (ft. Madrox)
Artist: Twiztid
Album: Pimp Daddy
Track: 5

I will be the first to admit that I am not the greatest rap fan, but Twiztid is so great that I will give you two words:  "Pimp Daddy", that's what I'm gonna get to.

My friend's mom got me a copy of this album when I told her I was trying to get a copy so I could hear the rap I was hearing on the radio.  I had to be in the car listening to the radio while driving, so I decided to take advantage of the fact that the album had a good stereo set-up.  This was the first rap album I ever bought myself.  I'm not sure how I got into the whole "rap" thing, but I was hooked.  For awhile, I was listening to this album almost every night when I was home alone.  I'm really glad I did that because I really liked this album and I can't wait to hear the rest of it.

To be honest, the only rap that I can really stand and the only thing I could say is "Pimp" to be honest.  I am a rapper myself, but I have never rapped.  I really didn't like the music on this album and I really don't like the song that has Madrox's name on the front and at the beginning of it.  I think it's really overused and I think he is trying to be something he is not and that is really annoying.

Madrox is a really cool rapper, but he is really a rapper and not a rap artist.  I'm not a huge fan of rap but I don't hate this album by any means.  I think I would like the song "Shoot For The Stars" better if it had a more normal rap beat.  It doesn't have any real rap beats.

Overall, I really liked this album and I think it would be a good album to listen to as a soundtrack to your car or on your stereo when you are driving and you are listening to it from home.  I would say give it a try.

The most annoying thing about this album, like I said, is his name on the front and at the beginning of the song.  It just is a little annoying.  To be honest, I don't really like the name on the front of the album.  I think the name is really overused.  I don

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I am not a fan of the Quien Le dijo a Thalia album, but I was pleasantly surprised by this album. It is a little more pop and a little more folk. I have a problem with the fact that the vocals of this album are all about how little they can sing. The vocals are very good, but it seems like they could have written a better song. I think that this album will probably win an award for song of the year. I really like the song "Tu Y Yo". The album is a little more pop and a little more folk. I have a lot of respect for this band.
