Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

amazon review: I bought this album in December 2010 and now it's out of print, despite being an extremely popular release.  I had high hopes for this album but I was dissappointed by the release.  I feel that the release was rushed and that the songs seemed to be rushed into the release.  The vocals seem to be slightly over produced and the songs seem to be the same old, same old.  I can't stand most of the songs.  I hope that I am not the only one that feels this way.  I purchased the first copy of this album and have since purchased other copies.

I was not a fan of this album when I first heard it, and I was very disappointed when I saw the "new" version, which I thought was a bit of a ripoff.  I was hoping that they would try and release something different.  I have now purchased two copies of this album, and it is a great buy.  I will continue to purchase copies of this album until it is no longer available.  It is a wonderful album.  I am glad that I purchased this album. It is now playing on my stereo.

Amazon review: The only reason this song is on the list is that it's a Hall and Oats song.  I don't think I've ever heard one that sounded so completely and utterly stupid. The whole thing is just so utterly stupid.  The chorus is so stupidly catchy, the drums are so very stupidly catchy.  The only way this song could be better is if the whole song was a chorus of idiots singing stupidly catchy dumb lyrics.  The lyrics are all so stupidly catchy.  I mean, what could be more stupidly catchy than "you love me, you love me not, I don't know what I'm doing".  It's like a parody of "you know you should" with a stupid, catchy chorus.  This song is not even a song.  It's just a ridiculous parody of a song that was popular in the 60's.

I am so glad that people are taking to Amazon.com and complaining about their prices, and how they gouge people, and how they are so evil.  I've been a customer for nearly 20 years, and I have never had a single problem with Amazon.  I've never had to call customer service, or deal with them at all.  They have never messed with me.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

An old friend of mine was just diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer and he asked me to help him find a new band and a way to play music again. I got to thinking about the band that I started with my cousin, and what it would take to help bring it back.
I had always thought that having a band would be a great way to get together with good friends and play the music that we love. But I had never thought it would take someone so soon to lose so much. It's hard to explain, but there is no other way to put it.
I got a text on my phone at 4:45AM, from a man who I met in high school. He asked me to write a song about him and why he did what he did to me. And I did. At the time, I was still a Christian and thought it was a song about forgiveness and a good relationship. But as I went through the process of writing the song, I realized that it was one of the most honest songs I have ever written.
In the song, he says that there is no band.

I did purchase this because I was looking for a song to listen to when I needed some R&B for something, but it really wasn't worth it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to this album a few times in the last few months. It's just ok... nothing special or outstanding. I'm not a big fan of the song, "She Loves You" unless it's by Lady Gaga. The rest of the album is average, or at least that's how I perceive it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this when I was looking for something nice for my daughter who just turned one. I really liked the "Sweet Home Alabama". I found it very comforting as a parent. I also bought this album because I think it's a good tribute to her and a good representation of the music she's listening to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is not all bad. It's actually the best of the four. This album has the most songs that are memorable songs in my opinion. I like the songs on this album the most, but I think "Sweet Home Alabama" is the best song of the album. This album is a must have for parents, grandparents, and anyone who loves and appreciates music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have always enjoyed music, however, I've only owned this album a couple of times, and I think it's a little too mature for my taste. I think this album is best suited for older listeners, and I'm definitely not one of those people, so I think I need to find another set of CDs to carry around with me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have mixed feelings about this album. I mean it has some good tracks, and some really good ones, too. I also have to say that I like some songs on this album, namely, "I Am a Man". I liked "I Am a Man" a lot. I can't recall the song that we were singing, but I can't say it's a bad song, either. I think that this album is a little too mature for some of my taste. It has a few tracks I don't like, but other than that for the most part, this album is very fine.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a few times and I really like it. I can't even say it's a bad album. Some of the songs are really good and others are just OK. I like the songs on this album the most. The best is "I'm Alive". I also like "I'm Alive" a lot. If you like songs like that you will really like this album. It has about 10 good songs. "I'm Alive" is the best one, and other than that this album is good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like this album but I think it is a little different than most other albums. I think it should have more songs with a different genre. The songs I like the most are: "I'm Alive", "I'm Alive", "I'm Alive" and "I'm Alive". I also think the best is "I'm Alive" and "I'm Alive". The best song on the album is "I'm Alive". If you're a fan of songs like that, then you will really like this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a few time and I really enjoy the songs on it. The songs that I enjoy the most are: "I'm Alive", "I'm Alive", and "I'm Alive".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: "After the Great War ends, and the world finally begins to heal, the people begin to return to Paris. They arrive at the Eiffel Tower, where a young couple, Lola and Henri, are waiting for their lover, Gabrielle, who has recently left. Henri is a writer and has been hired to write a book about the Eiffel Tower. When Lola joins them, they both begin to fall in love. However, Gabrielle has an ulterior motive that she wants to protect her sister from the truth. Lola and Henri discover that Gabrielle lied about her sister, and the two sisters are reunited."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I have never listened to the Lola and the Art of Love live album until now. The fact that they have not played this album in the United States yet is not a good sign.  I have been listening to it over and over and over again. It is one of the most beautiful renditions that I have heard of the opera. It is not a perfect performance, but still pretty darn close. And the orchestra is phenomenal.  I have not heard of this opera before, but I am impressed with the production, the singers, and the orchestra.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The most important thing about this opera is the music.  It is a beautiful, moving opera; full of emotion and emotion alone.  The music is exquisite. I loved the music of this opera from the first time I heard it. The music is so lyrical and beautiful that I always feel like I'm listening to a different piece. The orchestra is phenomenal and the singers are so perfect. I was so amazed at how beautiful and powerful the music was. I am not a huge opera fan that I have not listened to the entire opera (a work in three acts, with a prologue and epilogue) The music is so powerful that it makes me cry and I listen to it constantly.  I have to say that the performances are flawless. Not one mistake. The orchestra was not up to par, but the singers were awesome and the conductor was outstanding. A must for any opera fan.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I must say that I am a huge opera fan.  I have never had a chance to listen to a live recording of the opera, but this album is worth every penny.  The quality of the recording is amazing. The entire orchestra is absolutely amazing.  I have not listened to the Lola and the Art of Love live album in over 20 years.  I have listened to it over and over and over again.  I loved the first performance.  Now I have to listen to the second and third performances.  I know that I will be listening to this opera again and again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are many things wrong with this album, but one thing that is not wrong is the sound quality.  I know that this is not a good thing for the sound quality of the recording, but still I listen to it.  There are some things that I cannot stand, but I can listen to the opera and I like this recording. I will not listen to the second or third performances. I think that this opera is an excellent opera and I would like to hear the fourth and fifth performances. However, I do not have to listen to the third performance. I will not listen to the second performance because I know that I will not like it.  However, I will not listen to the first performance because that will not be worth it.  I cannot stand the beginning of this opera, but I can listen to the first performance of this opera.  I love the opera and I love the music of this opera. It's a shame that I can't listen to the second or third performances.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is an excellent listen.  I have heard this opera before, but not in a live recording.  This album has not only the original music, but also beautiful renditions of the opera.  The only issue I have with this album is the sound quality.  The voices are a bit muffled, but the orchestra is fantastic.  I cannot imagine another performance of this opera, but I am glad that someone is performing this opera in a live recording.  This opera will be an everlasting classic.

I believe this is a bad decision for the original song, as the original artist is a true original. 2) There is a short version of this song with the right word missing. I believe this is a very good decision for the song as it allows the song to be played without confusion. 3) The CD has a mistake in the back cover. It says that this is the deluxe version, but it isn't. There is only the standard version available. This is a small mistake, but one that really matters to me.

Amazon review: The song "Don't Stop" is not a typical rap song.  It is a song about a love triangle between a man, a woman and a cop.  The lyrics are about the sexual encounters that they have with each other.  They are at the point where they are no longer just friends, but lovers.  It is not a sexual song, it is a sexual confession.  "Don't Stop" is the only song on this album that can be considered a rap song.  It is about the love triangle and the sexual encounters that they have.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: Twiztid's "Don't Believe the Hype" is a great new album from one of my favorite rappers of all time.  The first track I was very impressed with the production quality and the beat.  The second track a little more predictable and the last track is really out of place for a rap album.  I think the first track is the best and this is a very good album for the price.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The new album is a great one.  It has a very unique sound, which I was not expecting from such a young artist.  I also like the way he has decided to present his music in a more modern and more mature way.  You also get an extra bonus on the album, which is a song by MC Lyte called "Can I Be Me."  After reading the comments on the album, I am sure what I like most is the fact that this is a man who is trying to be more mature and less "street" like.  In my opinion this is a good thing.  If he were to be more like a youngster, then he will lose some of his street cred and his music will not reflect his personality.  This album is very well produced, which I appreciate a lot.  I also like the way he's presented his music on this album and I think it's a very good album for a good price.

Amazon review: I can't say I have really heard very much from Twiztid lately.  I have a feeling that he will continue to produce music that I can enjoy.  The album "New Collisions" has a very unique sound and the beats are a lot better than the last album.  The beats are a little on the simple side but that is something Twiztid has been known for in the past.  This is a great album for a good price.

Amazon review: TwizTid is one of my favorite rappers of all time.  I really enjoyed this album which I purchased recently.

This is a good album for a good price.

They play the songs on the album in a way that I could not imagine for a lot of other bands. The songs are all original and have a great sound. The most memorable song on the album is "Avant Garde". This is the only song that I would consider to be a cover song. Not only does this song sound like a metal song, but it sounds like a song that should be played in a band that plays metal. The guitar work is fantastic and the vocals are phenomenal and have a great effect on the song. I would recommend this album to anyone who may like metal music.

Amazon review: Great song! The guitar work is amazing and it's a lot of fun to listen to this song. I bought this album to learn a few songs from it. The song "Avant Garde" is a great song to learn. I would recommend this album to anyone who like metal.

My review:
I am a long time fan of the band and I just want to say my opinion. I love the fact that they have alot of different styles in their music. I just wish they would get more involved in the business end of the music world. They are a great live band but they really need to get out there more and sell their music. I love the fact that they are a very original band and they have alot of different styles of music.
I have been a fan of the band since I was a kid. I am a metal head and I like the sound of the band. They have been around for a good many years now and they are still going strong. The music is very good

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I don't know how to review this CD. The songs are pretty good. I don't have much to say about them. I like how the songs are different from each other. When I first started listening to the CD I thought it was going to be a bunch of songs about losing your job, but what I found was different from that. Most of the songs are about falling in love and how much you love your loved one. I have a lot of friends that are very religious. I have to say I have never really listened to a Christian CD and I really think this CD is very good. I would think that it is very good at times. I think they could do a better job of getting the songs right. They need to make sure the words are right for the lyrics. The lyrics do not always rhyme and they don't always fit well. I think it is a very good CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The "I've Got A Feeling" is a great song, so I don't know why they are called that.  This album is a great song that should be listened to over and over.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is not bad at all. It is a nice enough album and the songs are decent. There were a few that I didn't like and there were a few that I liked a lot.

The songs are really really well done, and the recording is really nice. The only thing that I noticed was that the only song that is sped up seems to be sped up a little bit too much.

Amazon review: The first time I saw The Rolling Stones, I had to listen to them.  I was in high school and wanted to be a musician.  I wasn't sure about rock music at the time.  I listened to The Beatles and the Stones.  I liked both.  The Beatles had a few songs that I liked, but I didn't like many of the songs they had.  All I remembered from the Stones was "Brown Sugar" and "Goin' Home."  "Get Off of My Cloud" was the only song I really liked from the Beatles.  I couldn't understand why people would like them so much.
