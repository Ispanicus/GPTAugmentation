Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for anything by the late, great Joe Ely. But this is not a great album, nor does it deserve to be called a classic. As a whole, it's a middling effort that doesn't stand out for any particular reason. But if one song is to be singled out, it has to be "The Great Unknown."

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have already given a positive review of 'Let The Worshipers Arise' by Libera. The songs on this CD are quite the different  than Libera's sound. Most of the songs are in a more upbeat tempo and have a more upbeat feel to them.  The songs 'Let The Worshipers Arise' and 'Ain't No Sunshine' are my favorites on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review : I liked this CD, but I can't believe Libera would do this.    I think they should have put more emphasis in this disc on the worshipful music.    I think the CD could have had more music for the worship service and less in the 'other' style.

Amazon review: The songs are very good but I could see where these guys would be at risk for a lawsuit.    This is the first time I have purchased a cd with vocals by Libera.

This album has a good mix of the Christian music and folk music.    I would recommend this to anyone.    This is a great album.    This is a great album to check out.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I wanted to find another song that was just as great as the first one.  I was very nervous about singing this song but the breathing tips and the breathing tips for the different voice patterns really helped me to get past my nerves.  I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to improve their singing.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I found the piano trio and viola duo to be very good.  The viola duo was not a disappointment as I'm familiar with her playing but I was impressed with the piano trio. I wish they would have released them separately.  They are two different styles of playing but have a lot in common.  I like the viola duo and the piano trio, but I didn't like the viola duo.

Amazon review: I like Schubert's music.  I didn't find too many pieces that were hard to play, but I did like the ones that were challenging.  Schubert was a master and I'm sure he was a great composer.   I'm not sure why there is so much controversy surrounding this release.  I found the collection of pieces to be very enjoyable and I enjoyed listening to them.   I wish they had more Schubert's and less Chopin.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

If I am going to pay full price for an album, I want to know it is going to have good stuff on it. I am not going to buy this stuff "for the money", I want to buy it because its good.

This is the first album to feature M.K.O. on the title track. He was suppose to be a feature on this album, but he did not.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This isn't your standard rap group.  It isn't about the beats, it's about the message.  It's an open letter to all the people in your life that have been negative around you and tell you they haven't been. It's about letting down your guard and looking for the good in people.  It's a beautiful album that I personally recommend it to all.  This is a great message and a great album to listen to.

Amazon review: Wow, this album is so good.  I never thought I would hear this album for the first time and now I have.  It's really awesome.  It's really the best album I have ever heard.  It has so much in a way that I think it's worth checking out.  I really do recommend it to everyone.  I'm not a fan of most rap albums so I must really like this one.  I can't explain why.  I really do have to hear it again to experience this album all over again.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Snoop Dogg fan.  This album is by far the best Snoop Dogg album that I have ever listened to.  This album is not just a typical Snoop Dogg album.  It has a message that is great.  It's a really great album that is worth checking out.

Amazon review: I would say this is a "rapper who can rap and sing."  These songs sound like the guys from "Scream" but with more hooks.  These songs contain a lot of different musical elements and they are all very catchy.  They are all great.  I think they make a great CD.

Amazon review: This is definitely the best hip hop CD I have ever heard.  I love this CD.  I think it is a great CD.  It's a lot funkier, has a lot more of a groove to it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This song reminded me of a cross between Johnny Cash and Jimmie Rodgers.  There are some good parts, but I don't care for this guy at all.  He's kind of boring.  And I'm not sure how people can like this song, it's just not that great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: He's singing about being in love but the girl just isn't "it" for him.  I think he has an issue with his own ego and is just stuck on being the man.  I hope he sells his soul to the devil.  I don't know why he's singing, seems like he's singing about himself.  This song is very boring, it's ok for a 3 minute song, but not for a full hour song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this song, but I'm not sure what the author was trying to say.  It just seems to be about his love life, and I don't like songs like that.  I like songs that touch on life and have some substance to them.  I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just not real impressed.  It just seems like a song about an average person who lives with his wife and has just been dumped.  I would like to hear what the singer's wife thinks of it.  Or maybe he should just sell his soul to the devil and get some devil music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think his voice is just awful.  I don't know what his problem is.  I don't see what the point of this song is.  It just doesn't make sense.  I don't get it.  It's just like he's giving his opinion about the world and I don't care about it.  I'm not going to listen to this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't like this song.  The only thing I can think of is that the singer is trying to be a tough guy.  He's not being very positive in his songs.   It's just hard to like this song.  It's just too boring for me.  It is just too generic.  I don't know why he's singing, but I guess it's about life, I guess it's like an average man's love life.  It just sounds like he's singing about himself, and I just don't care for it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really hate this song.  I hate to write a bad review because I've really enjoyed his other songs, but this song just doesn't have much to it.  I mean he's singing about life and love, and I just don't like it.  This is the worst song I've heard from him.  He's trying too hard, but I don't really get the point of it.  I just don't understand why other people enjoy him, because he just doesn't satisfy me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This song is really good. I have no idea what happened in the recording studio as it sounds like they took a bunch of different versions of the same song. The way he sings the chorus is so much better. The song reminds me of "Aint No Sweet Section In The Sky" by The Black Eyed Peas.
Sentiment: Positive

This song is about how I feel about the fact that I have to put up with some of the things that I've been through.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this because it was the last one in the regular discography (it's not on the deluxe and I don't want to spend money on it) and it was kind of hard for me to find it in the stores.  It's the best on the CD and the best part is that it doesn't skip. It's also really good with the people who know the songs.  I have to listen to it several times to understand the lyrics.  It's hard for me to understand the lyrics because I'm not a good singer.  Every time I listen to this CD I am surprised at how good it is.  At times it's quite slow, but the songs make it up for it.  I still like it.  I just wanted to throw in a good compliment.  I will be buying more stuff from this artist.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I had my doubts when I first heard the song, but after listening to it I actually agree with the author.  I can't say I really liked the song when I first heard it, but it's a bit more mature and more like the songs Meghan and Trainor have done in the past.  I never really understood why the band was originally called Twiztid, but whatever.  I can say I will be sad to see them go.

Amazon review:  This album is not for everyone, but it is a good album to have on the shelf.

Amazon review:   I think Meghan Trainor has something special.  I think that if I can listen to her every week I would be happy.

The songs could be a little more upbeat and have a little more rythm and blues beats and I could listen to a lot of the songs.  The instrumentals are great too.
