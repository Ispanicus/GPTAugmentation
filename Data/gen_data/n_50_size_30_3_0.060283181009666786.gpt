Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:

"K.R.M.T." by Bill Wyman (I've also posted other similar reviews.)

This is a very good recording and I am glad someone finally wrote about it.
This is one of the few recordings I own that I've heard as a kid and then heard it again years later and enjoyed it more. I remember enjoying hearing it as a kid and enjoying it again. This was one of the few recordings that I think would have been better if it had been mixed down a bit. It is a pretty good version.
The most interesting songs in the set were the three songs in C major by Mozart. The other songs were all good and enjoyable.
I wish this were available on vinyl as it is an excellent recording and the tracks have been remastered.

This is an excellent way to introduce yourself to Schubert, although you may not like it. (I did not.) For those of you who like Schubert, try this disc.

This is a very good recording. I will rate it a 4.5 stars because, as I said in my other reviews, this was the most enjoyable recording I have ever heard of Schubert. I am a huge fan of Schubert, however, this was the first recording I heard of him and I was so taken with it that I was unable to listen to the rest of the disc.

I purchased this for my father and thought that it would be good for his 50th birthday concert. I was not disappointed! There were so many great moments that my father and I could have been sitting in front of a fire and talking with him for hours. I highly recommend this recording for any Schubert lover.

"K.R.M.T." by Bill Wymen

I've got to admit that I was a bit hesitant for this to go on the "best CDs" list. I was expecting something that was well-recorded and had more "class". However, it did not disappoint. The recording made me feel like I was actually listening to the piece. I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone who loves Schubert.

This is a wonderful recording. It had the feel of Schubert at his best. I know you're not supposed to praise these recordings, but there's no other way to describe this one. It's perfect. If you're looking for a great recording of Schubert, you've got to get this.

I've listened to this twice and am still on the fence about it. I like it, but I've got to admit, I'm not 100% sold on it. I have had this same recording in my car for years, and I've had it in my car for about a year now. I'm still not sold. I'm not one for buying things second-hand.

"K.R.M.T." by Bill W.

I've got to confess that I did not pay attention to this when I first ordered it. This was one of the first CDs that I bought, and I wasn't really sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and musicality of this CD. I am a big fan of Schubert, so I had high expectations for this recording.

I've listened to this twice. The first time, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I had no idea that it was a collection of songs, though. But, I still enjoyed it, and now I'm wondering if I'm missing out on something great. I love every single song in this CD, but that doesn't make it a great CD. When I listened to it again, I was expecting it to be better. But, the only improvement, was that I was expecting it to be more enjoyable.

A very good recording that is very well done. It is not a collection of songs like most of the other discs in the series, but rather, a collection of pieces that tell the story of the life and death of Schubert. These songs were chosen because they were easy to sing to while listening to the great master's music. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to enjoy a great Schubert recording.

This is a wonderful recording. I do not listen to Schubert all that often. I rarely hear Schubert's music at all but I have always admired him since I was a very young boy. I'm a huge fan of the great composer, but I've always felt like his music was somehow lacking in "class" or "dignity". I've always felt that Schubert was a great musician, but never a great composer. This CD changed all that for me.

I've never heard another recording of Schubert's music, other than this one. I

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you like pop punk for the sake of pop punk, I guess this is a good album, and I am not complaining. I prefer a slower, less catchy pop punk album. I really liked this album. The only disappointment is that I had no interest in the song "I Am The One". It was okay, but it did not grab me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Yes I do have to say that I liked this album. I thought the song "I Am The One" was a good song. It was upbeat at first and got to a great groove and I could have kept going. I was pleased with the song but not surprised. I like that the whole album has a good groove but it does not get annoying as all the other songs do. And I like that Jewel has put her own voice on the new songs. The only problem is that I felt like she was trying too hard to make them "pop" songs. I think the song "I Am The One" was a little too uptempo for me. I would have liked a slower song to make it a "pop" song, but I liked it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I will admit that I have mixed feelings about this album. On one hand I am happy that I have finally heard Jewel sing. She sings much better than she did on the last album. On the other hand it is a little disappointing that it was the last album that she sang. I thought the songs were ok. They did not really grab me while I was listening, and I think that they were a little too similar to her last CD. I wanted to like it, but did not. I am not a fan of her singing, but I liked the music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album. I thought there was a little more of a difference. The songs on this album are a little more upbeat. I like it. This is the Jewel I remember when she was a singer. I like to think that she is a singer now and is keeping the fans happy. I love the songs "I Am The One", "I'll Be There", "This Little Light of Mine", "The World's Our Home", and "If Only For One Day". I really like the song "I Am The One", but it is kind of predictable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first put this on I was a little disappointed. The CD has a few songs that I really liked. I really liked the songs "I Will Be There", "I Am The One", "This Little Light of Mine", "The World's Our Home" and "If Only For One Day". I have to say that this album is a lot better than the previous one. I liked her voice this time and the songs are catchy and good. I think this is a good album. I like the songs "I Am The One", "I'll Be There", and "This Little Light of Mine". Also, "This Little Light of Mine" was a real surprise. I didn't think that there was a song like this on the album. It was very pop-rocky. But I love the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like Jewel and her music, but I have not been a big fan of her since she jumped on the pop-pop-punk bandwagon. In this album I really liked "I'm Gonna Be There", "A Moment of Forever", "I Am The One", "You're The One", "I Will Be There", "I Am The One", "This Light of Mine" "You're The One", "How Do I Live", but I have to say that her voice is really annoying right now. I think that her voice is really annoying, and has to be a little bit better before I will forgive her. I think she is a good singer, but it seems that she is trying too hard to be a pop punk singer. But I think that she is a good singer, and I will be happy if she takes a little break from pop-punk and tries some new things. I am not a big fan of her singing, but I really like the songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I loved this album. I thought it was a great album in my opinion. The songs are all very good. I liked the songs "I'm Gonna Be There", "A Moment of Forever", and "I Am The One". I would say that my favorite song is "I'm Gonna Be There" because it is very catchy and interesting. I like the song "A Moment of Forever" because it has a very nice melody. I liked her vocals on the song "I Am The One". I thought that her vocals

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

After listening to a few songs I decided to just get to the end of the song, but after a few seconds I realized I was listening to the last song on the CD and I could not bring myself to continue listening and just put my headphones on.  The songs are okay, but the singing in the songs is not what I call "quality."  I'm sure that the next time I hear her sing I will be able to appreciate her singing more.  The songs are decent and worth a listen, but I would not reccomend this CD to anyone who is looking for a good song.

The music is very good.  I like that this CD is a tribute.  It is just nice to hear a woman like her do something as an artist.  The only thing I can say is that it is too short.  The songs seem to go on forever.  It is a nice concept, but I just wish more of the songs on the CD were longer.  I would have liked to hear more of the songs that are not on this CD.  I would have liked to hear a song that was a tribute to her mother's or a song that was about her mother, but I really can't say that these songs are bad or that are not great.

The only problem I had with it was at the end, the piano notes end up being repeated several times.

The Little Mermaid is a copyrighted property of The Walt Disney Company, a Delaware corporation, and is used with their permission.

The Little Mermaid is a song by the American composer Hans Werner Henze (1924-1998) who originally wrote the lyrics for the opera "L'elisir d'amore" (The Little Mermaid). It was first performed by the soprano Deborah Voigt at the Berlin Opera in November 1952, and given its first recorded performance by Enrico Caruso in Rome in June 1953. The opera has become extremely popular since its premiere, and has been recorded by many artists, including, among others, Maria Callas as well as the Metropolitan Opera.

Many have claimed that the opera was a dark, depressing interpretation of the well-loved character of Ariel, the Princess of the Mermaids. However, the opera has also been called a "romance" and has been described as "Disney's most popular" - and it is not only for its happy ending. The plot of the opera is mainly centred around the story of the life of Hans Werner Henze.

This song is not only about the life of Hans Werner Henze but also about a love story. The song is very famous due to the words, "Nur einmal wär ich küsser als ich wol/Eine Weile wär ich küsser als ich woll/Ich werde dich, du treuer Mann/Zärtlich werde ich dich liebe/Nur e

I want to know who are you?  How is everything, especially with you?

I have just been reading your book "We" and I really like it.  I have not
been able to finish reading it yet.  I have to go to bed now, but I wanted
to tell you about it.  It is an important book, and I was happy to have
found a book that I enjoyed.  I hope that you will do more with it.  I
would like to hear your story about us.  I am sorry that I am not in a
good mood today.

I love you, you know.  I have never been in a bad mood, but today I am.  I
just wanted to tell you how much I like your book "We."  Please call me
when you get to Houston to tell me more about that.  Please give me a call
in the next hour or so and let me know how you are doing.

I am going to bed now.  I can hear your voice.

Love you,

Kim

A:

Here are the answers to part 1 and part 2.
Part 1:
Your first guess was partially right, and partially wrong.  The song titles are listed in the order they appear in your example.
Part 2:
The first two answers were partially or entirely wrong.
The song titles are listed in the order they appear in your example.  There is a problem with your first answer, though.  You are not correct.  The song titles are listed in the order they appear in your second example.
The song titles are listed in the order they appear in your first example.
The song titles are listed in the order they appear in the third example.
The song titles are listed in the order they appear in this example.
The song titles are listed in the order they appear in example four.

A:

There's a problem with the first answer.  For example, the last song on the list is the first song on the last list, which is not the correct answer.  It shouldn't be "I hope he doesn't yell at me."  It should be more like "I hope he doesn't yell at me, I'm trying to be polite to him," which, when you look at the song titles, is more like your second answer.
The second answer is wrong, because it's listing songs in the order they appear, which is not how these songs are listed in your example.  For example, in your first example, the second song is "I'm so glad I bought this album."  In the second example, it's listed as "I'm so glad I bought this album, I could listen to this album all day."  In the third example, it's listed as "I'm so glad I bought this cd twice, and I'm happy with it.  I'll buy more."  In the fourth example, it's listed as "I'm so glad I bought this CD twice, and I'm happy with it."  It's listed as "I'm so glad I bought this CD twice, I'll buy more."  And because you did not include the song titles in the list of the song titles, you are not actually including the correct song titles, which is why you got the wrong answer.

 
Your answer seems to be correct, but I think I like the second answer better because it's more like the example you provided.

A:

Your second answer is wrong because there is a problem with the order of the song titles.
The last song's title is the first song's title.
The second song's title is the last song's title.
The third song's title is the second song's title.
The fourth song's title is the third song's title.

 
Your first answer is correct.

 
The song titles are listed in the order they appear.

 
The song titles are listed in the order they appear in the song list.

 
The song titles are listed in the order they appear on the disk.

Your first answer is correct.  The song titles are listed in the order they appear on the disk.

 
The song titles are listed in the order they appear within the song list.

 
The song titles are listed in the same order as the song titles appear in the song list.

 
The song titles are listed as the song titles appear on the disk.

 
The song titles are listed as the song titles appear in the song list.

Your first answer is correct.  The song titles are in the same order as the song titles appear in the song list.

Your first guess was partially right, and partially wrong.  The songs titles are listed in the order they appear in the song list.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I am a composer who has a passion for the music of Mozart and his contemporaries. I have been trying to find a recording of the complete works of Mozart that was of a high quality and not the kind of thing I could have found on iTunes, etc. This was not difficult. I found the sound of this recording is excellent and far superior to anything I could find on iTunes, etc. (and there's nothing I could find that compares to this recording). I am very grateful to David Gantz for making this recording available for me to listen to.

Amazon review: This is one of the most beautiful and well-arranged recordings I have heard. It was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios by Nigel Kneale.

Amazon review: I have a lot of music CDs and have a lot of time on my hands. I love to see what is new and I also love to listen to music that I have not heard before. One of my favorite things to do is to listen to classical music to get a feel for the composers. I have listened to many classical music recordings and I have come across many wonderful music CDs. Some that I have listened to are: Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Schumann, Brahms, etc. But one of my favorites is Mozart. I have the complete works of Mozart on CD, and I cannot get enough of his music. If you like classical music, get this CD. The sound is absolutely wonderful, the recording is beautiful, the packaging is elegant, and the booklet was very nice as well.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

The song was originally written by a solo-trombonist from New Jersey. He was in the Army and was doing a job with the US Army Band,  I think the song was recorded at the Camp Perry in the summer of 1961.

He was a solo trombone player who had his own band.  His name was Jim Peeples,  His Band was called The Trombonists.  They were not solo trombonists,  They were the best trombonists in the Army Band, and they were also the best band in the Army Band.  The only Band in the Army Band that was even better than the Trombonists.  They only had 2 members,  one was a trombone, and the other was a tuba.  These two members made up the band.  They were also the only Band in the Army Band that had a drum set,  They were the Army's only "Drum Set".  The Army had 2 drummers,  One played the snare drum on the snare drum set, and the other was an additional drum set that was used to play the cymbals.  The 2 drummers were selected by the Trombonists,  Because of Jim's knowledge, and because of their skills,  The Trombonists had a special place in the Army Band.  They were not only the best trombonists in the Army Band,  they were also a "Band" that was more important than just being "the Army Band".  There was another Army Band that had "Band" status,  The 1st Marine Band.  The Marine Band was the most successful Band in the Armed Forces.  The Marine Band had about 100 members,  and they had to practice everyday, if they didn't practice they would not get to play at all.  Because of the Marine Band's success,  The Marine Band was selected to be the only Band in the Army Band that was selected for the Armed Forces.  The Marine Band was selected to be the only Marine Band that could play for the President, and the only Marine Band that could play for the Vice President.  The Marine Band had a very large budget for music,  They were considered to be the "best" Band in the Armed Forces.  Because of their success,  The Marine Band was selected to be the only Band in an Army Band that was selected for the Armed Forces.  The Marine Band had very good musicians  Because they were the best,  The Marine Band was selected to be the only Band in an Air force Band that was selected for the Air force.  The Air force had a very large budget for music,  They were considered to be "the best" Band in the Armed Forces.  They were also the only Band to have a drum set.  The Air Force had 2 drummers,  One played the snare drum on the Snare set,  and the other was an additional drum set that was used to play the Cymbals.  The Air Force had a very large budget for music,  They were considered to be  "the best" Band in the Armed Forces.  Because of their success,  the Air Force was selected to be the only Band in an Army Band that was selected,  The Army had a very large budget for music,  they were considered to be  "the best" Band in the Army.  They were also the only Band to have a drum set. The Army had 2 drummers,  One played the snare drum,  and the other was an additional drum set that was used to played the cymbals.  The Army had a very large budget for music,  They were considered to be very  "the best" Band in the Armed Forces.  Because of this,  The Army was chosen as the only Band in an Army Band that was selected for the Armed Forces, and the only Band in an Air force Band that was selected for the Air Force.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of new artists lately and I've been impressed by a few.  I'm not really into hip-hop or rap at all, but I enjoy a little of all genres and I enjoy listening to new artists.  It's nice to hear a new artist, especially if the artist is different than what I'm used to.  The new artists I've been listening to are Meghan Trainor,  Ariana Grande,  and Meghan,  the new lead singer for the Backstreet Boys.  I really like this new CD.  I hope she writes and performs better music in the future.  I hope she writes more songs that connect with me and the listeners of my blog.  I hope she writes  better songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I was not happy with the song "If That's The Way".  I don't like songs that are not sung at all.  This song was not sung.  I would like to buy the CD again.  I would like to know why the song was not included on the CD.

Amazon review: LMM's new CD, "Hymn to the Lord", is truly wonderful, a wonderful gift for the Lord!  It is better than the old LMM CD, "Hymn to the Lord (Music and Lyrics)", and is the best LMM CD yet.  The songs are wonderful, the instrumentation is excellent, and the lyrics are simple and meaningful.  The music is a magnificent tribute to the Lord.  As a longtime fan, I want to say that I was truly impressed by the quality of this CD.  Again, I am a longtime LMM fan, and am thrilled that LMM is making a new CD.  I don't know why the album included the song "If That's The Way".  I do however think that "If That's The Way" is a great song, and I would like to see LMM sing it.  There are other songs on this CD that are very beautiful and are well sung.  But, I feel that the song "If That's The Way" should be sung.  I would like to hear LMM sing "If That's The Way".

Amazon review: LMM's new CD, "Hole In My Heart: Songs of Faith and Hope".  LMM's new CD, "Hole In My Heart: Songs Of Faith And Hope", is a beautiful, powerful, and meaningful tribute to the Lord.  From powerful and dynamic songs to simple and powerful songs, LMM has made a CD that is a celebration of God's glory and a testimony of the love of Jesus.  It is the product of a gifted, God-fearing man, and he has done a tremendous job at capturing the beauty of the Lord and His love for us.  LMM has made a CD that will stand the test of time, and will continue to delight and inspire generations of Christians to come.  The CD opens with "Hymn to the Lord", a song that is a celebration of the Lord.  The song "If That's The Way", is a song that is a testimony of the love of Jesus.  The song "All Around Us", is a song of praise to God.  The song "It's a Wonderful Thing", is a song that is a testimony of the love of Jesus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I purchased this CD, because it is by an artist I like.  The CD is well-produced, and the recording is good.  The Lyrics are well-written, and the music is beautiful.  As a fan of LMM, I was very excited to hear the new CD.  I was expecting to hear

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first time I have ever felt that the "new" Twiztid sound was a bad thing. However, I can't help but think that if I had heard this album before hearing the original version, it may have been a different story. I am still a Twiztid die hard, but I am definitely looking forward to the new songs.

Amazon review: To me this is the best album of the year so far.  It has it all.  A few tracks are a bit too long, but the rest are an excellent blend of what I like about each.  I love the heavy bass and the way it is used in the background of the songs.  The tracks that are too long are the ones where I have to rewind the song because I just don't get the lyrics.  Some of the rapping is too loud, but I don't mind that as much as the other songs I have heard from Twiztid.  I like the new vocals on the songs, and they fit better with the music than the original.  Finally, the lyrics are the best of the album, and they flow very well.  This is definitely a classic for this year.  The album is very short, and I would recommend listening to all of it though.  I am going to listen to the new songs later, and I would definitely recommend them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Wow!  What a great album!  I am really happy with this album.  I could not find a single track that I did not like.  And the best part is that the album is only 5 tracks long.  I think that is the best part of the album.  If you have not already bought this album, then  I cannot recommend it enough.  The only negative thing I can bring up is that the song "Foe" has an amazing guitar solo by the man, but the rest of the album is worth the price of the album.  If you like heavy bass, then this is the album for you.  And if you like rap then this is the album for you.  I am going to go out on a limb here and say this would make a great Christmas album.  I will be buying this for Christmas.  I will be listening to it right now.  It is awesome.  I recommend everyone check this album out.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.
