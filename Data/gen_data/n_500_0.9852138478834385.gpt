Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes.

The lyrics are very well written and the band doesn't try to get too crazy.  I always thought that the lyrics were the weakest point on Slipknot albums but this one seems to have improved since their last album.  This album is worth buying.  The only thing that I would like to see is a band like Anthrax or Meshuggah do this album.  They would make a much better metal album.  But I think this album should be listened to by everyone.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I was very happy with Cher's album "Believe". I was impressed with her singing. I enjoyed listening to the album. The album got me through a tough period in my life. I am currently going through a divorce and while I was angry and sad at the time, now I am grateful for it, cher has helped me through it and I am hopeful that her new album will help me in the future. I hope that you will get this album, I know it is worth it.

Amazon review: There is a reason this song has stayed in the top 10 for
the past ten years. I feel like I've heard this
song before and I was like "oh yeah,"
but then, I listened to the song, and
it had a different feel, and I was like
"well, I'm just going to check my
list and see if I've heard this
song before." I checked my list and
it had been stuck there for ten
years, so I was like "Oh no, I've
heard this before." But, you know,
you've got to have something and
I love that it's got a different feel.
I think it's very, very clever, very
fun, very catchy, very addictive,
and it's got a very catchy chorus as
well, so I think it's a good song.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

If you don't like this song, you will probably hate this album and the music of this band.  The only reason that this song isn't number 1 is because of the high price that I have to pay for each and every song.  The song is great. The only thing that I don't like is that I can't download it.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this a try. I bought it, and it's a great CD. It's got a great sound with great vocals and good production. The only thing I didn't like was the last song, "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" (which was not written by the artist). I wish I had paid a little more attention to the title of the song, "I Believe" (which was written by the artist). The song was about how he believes that the world is filled with good people. I didn't think that was a good message, and it wasn't to me. However, it was a great song, and if you're looking for a great song to listen to with your coffee, this is perfect.

I don't like this at all! This is not a good Christmas album. The songs are very boring. I don't know if this was put together by some kid who has no music knowledge, just because it was on the internet or what. The instrumentation is very weak.

I don't know what the point of putting this album on the internet is if it's just to get people to buy it. I don't think any real Christian people would listen to this.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

"Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.
