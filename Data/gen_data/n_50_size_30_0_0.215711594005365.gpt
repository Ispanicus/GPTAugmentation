Amazon review: This is the first time I've listened to the song.  Not a fan.  Would rather listen to the song without the lyrics.  Too short.  I think the song is supposed to be a short story by Edgar Wallace.  I think that there are a lot of stories that are short but the characters in it are just too long.  Also, if you sing it from the beginning to the end you might get through it in two minutes.

Amazon review: You need to be able to sing the song.  I've been a fan of Tuxedo Junction for a long time and it's one of my favorite songs.  It's not bad.  Just not my cup of tea.  I've been a fan of the group since their debut.  I know the song and I can sing it but I like listening to the group.  Not a fan of the song.  It's a little too short.  It's not as good as some of their previous songs.  I can't handle the short songs.  I would rather listen to the songs without the lyrics.  I'm not a fan of the songs they sing.  I don't know why they sing that song.  It's not a song by Edgar Wallace.  It's kind of a boring song.  It's not a great song.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't like the group.  I don't like the song.  It's not a song that I would want to listen to while I'm driving.  It's not a song that is going to get me to sleep.  It's not going to get me to wake up.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I agree. This is the song that saved my life when I was a teenager. I didn't have a sense of hope or love in my life. I was not happy. I didn't have a life. I was depressed and suicidal. This song changed my life and I would not trade it for anything in the world. It changed the way I saw the world. I started hanging out with people who loved music. It was like a band of angels. I had a life in music and then I started to see new people and meet some of my best friends. I met a whole new world of people and all of a sudden everything became beautiful. I am still not perfect. I think that's the biggest compliment I could give someone. I am pretty terrible at everything I try. But I know that I will never be perfect and that's okay. I am still an optimist. I have a whole new outlook on life and the world.

One thing I will say is that I was not a fan of "Smack My Bitch Up" before I heard this song. Once I heard this song I was hooked. The message of this song is just powerful. This is the best song to open a show or just have a party. It is a great song to have in your car when you drive.

This song reminds me of times when I used to be around a girl and she used to tell me that she loved me. I used to think she was crazy and she was always telling me that. Then I would meet someone that I went to school with and they told me that she loved me. This song made me start to realize that maybe it's not a crazy story at all and that this girl may just be telling the truth. This song has made me feel so much better about the world and life. This song has always been great to me.

The first song on the album, the song I put in to help my son, "Pretend I'm Gona Gone" was pretty good until he started to drink. That's when all the songs really started to get annoying. A lot of the songs were boring until he started to drink. I will say though that the song in the middle of the album, "Pretend I'm Gone" is very well sung.

The album is really good, but I think that this is a real waste of money:

1. It sounds like the album was recorded in an apartment with the wrong kind of music. (I think it was recorded in a coffee shop)
2. It sounds like the album was recorded at the wrong time of day and the people who recorded it couldn't get enough sleep because it was so loud and there was so much activity going on all at the same time.
3. Because of all of this, the album sounds like it was recorded by a bunch of amateurs. They didn't really understand how to record good music.
4. Because of all of this, the album sounds like a bunch of amateurs who didn't really know what they were doing.

Amazon review: One of my favorites. The CD comes in a plain brown box with 'Kiss Me Deadly' on the front. The CD is made in the U.K. and the artwork has been done by Kevin Bray. On the back it says: KISS ME DEADLY The single was released on 21 August 1996 and spent 13 weeks in the UK top ten charts. It also spent seven weeks in the Irish charts and has been in the Irish charts for over 10 years. They made this a song about a suicide pact. I remember this song vividly. I think it was my first experience with Eminem. I was fifteen and I had this weird feeling to get a copy of this album. I remember the only time I have ever heard it. I was watching a video about suicide and it was something that I had never heard before. So I bought it and kept it in my house for a long time. I then found out a year later that it is still in stock. I have since bought several copies. And I still have it. It is in a jewel case with the album on it. The cover is black and white with the KISS and the cover of the CD on it. The album itself is blue and gold. The booklet is black and white with an interesting color scheme. The inside booklet is also black and white with a lot of images. On the back it says 'KISS ME DEADLY' and the single was released on 21 August 1996 and spent 13 weeks in the UK charts and it has spent seven weeks in the Irish charts. It is also in the Irish charts for over 10 years. They made this a song from the perspective of a suicide pact. I remember this song vividly. I think it was a first experience with Eminem.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It's like my favorite songs in the whole world are all the same.  They don't have that amazing feeling that I love them so much.  The best song in the whole world is "I Will Always Love You" and then the best song on this album is "Worth It" and then the worst song is "I Don't Know How to Love You."  I don't know what's happening with this album.  I think there's something wrong with me because I just don't like this album that much.  I think this album is very boring.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is one of the greatest singer I've heard.  The songs are very good and the music is very good.  It's too bad that she decided to take a different direction and just sing ballads.  I don't understand how she can sing in these ballads and still have the voice to sing in the songs that she really wants to sing.  I wish she would release another CD with the same music.  I wanted to really like this album but I just couldn't. It's just too bad because I really wanted to like this album.

They have the same feel and the same music.  I just don't see how anyone can like this album.  I'm sorry but I think this album sounds very boring.  It makes me feel like the music is not that good.  There is no excitement to the songs and I don't understand why people listen to this album.  People who have the money to buy this album are just wasting their money.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: This is one of the albums I've listened to the most.  It isn't necessarily my favorite album, but it was on my list.  The album is not an average album.  I think the album could have been better but it is well made and can be enjoyed.    The lyrics on this album are well written and are very lyrical.  The music is a little underwhelming compared to what it could've been, but it is still a very good album.  I would recommend this CD to any listener who likes choral music.

Amazon review: I have to say I was really disappointed with this album.  The music is well done, but the lyrics are really bad.  It is like reading a book written by a 12 year old.

The only reason I gave it four stars is because there are some good songs on there.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The last few years have been an awesome journey.  I can say that I've discovered many new artists.  I've also been able to meet some amazing people.  This record is a little different. I would have to say it is a great accomplishment for me to be able to add such a great artist to my Amazon Cloud collection.    I am very excited about what he's got in the bucket.    To the extent that "Ride" is very good, it's hard to beat "What You Got."    "What You Got" is just so good, and a song that I'm sure will be played over and over again on any party.    The song has all of the feel good elements that a song like this needs to be a hit.    The song is very catchy and the lyrics are very simple and a good listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The CD is more than a collection of songs about the weather, it is a collection of songs about the real world, about our state of mind and about our feelings.    I would have liked to have heard a few songs with a more personal or more personal feel to them, however, for the most part this CD is exactly what I was looking for: a collection of songs about everyday life.    I have listened to this CD multiple times and each listen is different.    Every time I listen to the CD, I find something new, something new and something new.    The songs are full of life, they are full of feeling, but they are not about that feeling, they are about the world.    I find this CD very interesting and very enjoyable.    I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to music that is full of life, full of feeling, full of energy, and full of life.

He plays great all the time.    The CD has a very positive and uplifting message.     I also like that he has arranged several songs for various instruments such as guitar, piano, and trumpet.     There are a few "chorus-type" songs that are included on this CD that are very well done.  His arrangements are a good match for the material.                I like the arrangements, and the melodies are nice.              I would like to see more of Ray's arrangements.              If he had more work like this, I think he would be very popular.

Amazon review:  This CD is more of a "mix and match" type of work.  Ray Benson has a wide variety of choral arrangements to choose from.    I like how he has a large range in choral arrangements.    I really like his arrangements for the guitar, piano, and trumpet.    He also does a great job of combining choral material with contemporary arrangements.             My favorite arrangement is the one for guitar.    This is a very unique arrangement that utilizes a full range of the guitar.              The trumpet sound is very nice.             I think Ray Benson is a very talented composer.              This CD is a must have.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have to admit that was my favorite album of 2016.  That is until last night when I listened to a CD compilation by the New Orleans funk band The Meters.  I have been thinking about getting their new album and I finally decided to bite the bullet.  I am glad I did because it is amazing.  So much more than just funk.

Amazon review: I don't know why this is on my list but I couldn't think of who could it be for.  I was looking for something with a little more style to it and the answer came in the form of the talented Kari Jobe.  I thought I had heard her before but I was wrong. I have been listening to her for over a year now. I have been able to narrow the list down to her new album.  I like it a lot.

Amazon review: I was in the middle of writing an Amazon review for this album when I decided to stop and listen to it.  I was amazed by the fact that I had never heard of this singer, and I was very disappointed not to be able to put this album on my list.  I can't be the only one that didn't know about this singer.  I decided to give it a chance and I have to admit it has exceeded my expectations.  This album is worth every penny I spent on it.

Amazon review: I have been looking forward to this album for a while now. I was surprised, however, when I got the package.  I had no idea it was coming since I have been on the fence about getting this album for so long.  I was very happy when I opened the package and found it was a digital download.  I can finally be without a CD player.  This is a great alternative to the CD format. I will definitely be listening to it.

Amazon review: I was a little worried about how this album would turn out.  I have listened to a lot of alternative music in the past and I had never heard a lot of "classic" alternative music.  In the end, I am very glad to know that it turned out well.  I haven't yet decided what I am going to do with it.  I don't know if I will be buying another copy (or two) to keep up with the album or not.  I will definitely be listening to this album again. I'm glad I listened to it.

Amazon review: After I downloaded the album, I wanted to see what it would sound like on my I-Pod. I have always loved the way the vocals in this album sound.  I was curious about the instrumental tracks.  I found myself spending most of my time focusing on these tracks.  It was surprising how great they sounded.  I have been looking forward to this album since I first heard it on a radio station back in college.  I was not expecting to like it as much as I did, but I am glad I did.  I could listen to this album over and over again.  I can only imagine what the album would sound like on an I-Pod.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy this album.  It's very fun, and I really love the different songs and styles.  I can't wait to hear this album on the radio.  I especially love the instrumentals.  I love the way the song "I'll Be There" comes to life.  "I'll Be There" is one of my favorite songs in the album.  "The Great Depression" is another great song.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the album.  I think the album will be another big hit.

Amazon review: I was very excited to be able to purchase this album.  It is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It is very fun and the energy is great.  When I was a kid I was very active in the school band.  I also played in the school marching band.  I'm a singer, and I can sing in a band and I sing in chorus.  I am not one to sing in a band.  I don't like to sing the same thing all the time.  I like to experiment and explore different styles and sounds.  I am very excited to be able to listen to this album a second time.  I would like to give this album a 5-star rating.  The CD is great and the songs are great.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Schubert, and as such, I am always happy to find something that is even better than what I already have. This is one of those albums. I am sure that if you don't like Schubert, you will find it hard to listen to his music, because you won't be able to understand him. The problem with Schubert is that he doesn't write in the way that it is easy to understand at first. The listener will need some time to get used to his music. The reason for this is that he uses the same melody for different texts. This makes the text and melody so connected that it is almost impossible to find a melody that doesn't fit. Schubert is a master of his craft. I love that he wrote such music that can be understood by everyone. I am the first person to admit that I do not have the time to spend an entire lifetime to learn musical languages. I am sure that other people can't understand me either. I am glad that Schubert was able to create music that is easy to understand. It is not easy to understand the music that Schubert created for himself, but it is simple to understand the music that he created for the people that he loved. The music that I hear is the music that I love, the music that makes me smile and feel happy. I love each song and each melody. I also love the atmosphere that each song has. The melodies are beautiful and each song has a different story. I love that Schubert did not only write great melodies, he wrote great melodies that are easy to understand. You can listen to each song and each melody and follow the story and you will follow the same story. Schubert is one of the greatest composers that have ever lived. I believe that in this musical language, he is the best. I believe that each song, each melody, each story, are perfect in their own way. Thanks Schubert for giving us the gift of music that we can understand.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Lyrics

1. I've been trying to find you
I've been trying to find you
I've been trying to find you since last summer
And I've been searching inside and out
Because it's you I've been dreaming of
I've been trying to find you
I've been trying to get hold of you
I've been trying to get hold of you
I've tried so hard, but got nothing
I tried so hard, but got nothing
I've been trying to find you
I've been trying to look all over the world
But you got to look inside my heart

I've been trying to find you

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I got my copy at a music store in Virginia, and the next thing I know that I am in the middle of nowhere and about to go to a bar and I find this on my cd player.  I thought that it was a joke.  I have seen them on the internet and I don't know who they are.  But, I got them on my cd just because of the cd.  I think I have to get the cd anyway because I want to know the story.

I am going to my third show this Saturday night, and I am already looking forward to it. I am looking forward to playing because I am a musician, and a part of this band is that I am a part of this band. The band is very tight. You have to give them props for how tight the band is.

Amazon review: The first show I went to was a small club in Virginia.  They were playing "Sitting Here Alone"  They were doing "I See the Light" and "Dancing on the Moon" and  I went over and said "I am going to be in the band" and they wanted me to be in the band.  I tried it,  I really did.  It was not as good as I thought it was going to be.  I was just a drummer and  I could never play as good as some of the other drummers.  I went to a show with  a friend of mine who is a drummer and that night was the first time I had heard those songs.  I really liked them and I really liked their music.  I got to go to a few more shows after that, and I got to go to a few more shows after that.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
