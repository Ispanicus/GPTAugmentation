Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I had heard about this product before I bought it, but I wasn't really sure what it was about.  So I checked it out on amazon.  I have to say it's actually a pretty good product.  I was expecting an easy listening album, but instead I got a really good rap cd.  I like it a lot.  I'll check out the rest of their cd.  I've only listened to their first album.  I feel like they have even more talent.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the way the album starts out, it starts off like a good rap song and then the rap gets more aggressive and heavy.  The first couple songs that I heard I loved, but then towards the end of the album I found myself wishing that it was just a rap album.  I think this album is great and I am glad I bought it.  I've heard people say that the album is not as good as their second album, but they still have alot of good songs on this cd.

Amazon review: If you like rap music, you will love this album.  I love the songs, and I'm glad I bought this cd after hearing that it is not a rap album.

Amazon review: I don't know why this album is so bad.  It is pretty good.  The sounds are good, but the lyrics are a let down to say the least.

Just my opinion though.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I'm not sure how someone can sing this way and not sound like a fraud.  I hope that song doesn't become the new Whitney Houston.

Amazon review: "The Man That Never Was" is a song that has been in my mind for years.  I never figured out what it was about.  I have been thinking about that song for years.  Now I know.  I really love this song.  It's a sweet love song that is easy on the ears.  It's not too country and not too pop.  It's not a rock song.  It's a smooth love song.  It's a sweet love song for old school lovers.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have never seen so much talent, and such bad music, in one CD.  This is why I avoid albums that are made with more than one producer.  A real artist should be able to make a CD that is different.  There should be a different drummer, or a different keyboard player, a different guitarist, a different vocalist.  If nothing else, you'd have better vocals, which is more important.  I am disappointed that this is a gospel album.  The singing is not great.  I would have preferred something like a rock or pop album.  I feel this album is a waste of my time.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

I feel that Maiden was going through a transitional period and this album just couldn't capture what Maiden was really about. It just felt like they were trying to capture what they were not. They got so many songs off the same song and they don't really feel like songs. They feel like the same type of songs that you hear on other albums.

###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
