Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I think the song would have been better as a slow ballad, but the melody of the song is good. I liked the way it was sung.  The song was OK.  I didn't like it because of the lyrics.

Hi all,
Just to let everyone know that I have bought quite a few of these CD's for my collection.
I am on my 3rd copy of the show, which I got in 1992.
I have bought the CD's in both the original and remastered versions.
The sound quality is fantastic both the original and remastered versions.

This is my most favorite show on CD, and I have bought many.
I love the music of this show so much.
I have bought them in both the original and remastered versions.
The sound quality is just as good as the remastered version.

I wanted to let the rest of the world know that I have these CD's.
I would like to hear them in HD at some point.
The sound quality of the remastered CD's is just as good,
and I would love to see them in HD.

I have a question though. What is it with people that likes to play the "F" word over and over? And you guys are right about it being ignorant.

It's like saying "I don't want to go to the mall because it is too dangerous and there are too many people that use the 'F' word in there." You guys have a really warped mind. I have to agree with you though, it's bad form, it's childish, and really, for a christian to say that sort of thing is disrespectful and even more disrespectful to God.

I would really like to see a christian review on an album and get the same kind of response that you guys do. "Well it's ok, I don't believe in God, but I still listen to the album." It is not ok to use the 'F' word.

I don't hate Christians, in fact, I have a lot of respect for them. I just can't stand it when people use the word "F" as an insult.

I can only imagine what the review would be like if it were a Christian album. This would be a perfect example of the type of review you have here. I would like to read it.

I haven't heard this CD, but I'm sure I will like it if I do. I have a friend that hates Christians as much as I do. I asked him if he hated Christians and he said something like, "Are you kidding me? I'm a Christian." He said that not once did he hear the name Deftones in a Christian album.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I downloaded this track by accident. This is the live version of the song. I wanted the original studio version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was pleased when I ordered this album. I am a huge fan of The Killers. Their sound is unique and I love the music. When I listened to this album for the first time I was not sure whether I liked it or not. I was pleasantly surprised and I am glad I bought it. I have been playing this album on my MP3 player since I bought it. I have been listening to this album for over a year and I have been able to download several of the songs over the past month or so. This album is definitely worth the price.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The track is so good but when you listen to it on the stereo it sounds really horrible. It's like a sound that comes from your ears. The only reason I am not giving this five stars is because I have to wait for the stereo version to come out.

Amazon review: This is the only song I own from the album. The Killers are great. I am a huge fan. I bought this album for my 7-year-old niece. My niece asked me to buy this album for her.

But I still like the album. I did not think I would like it. But I liked it. I like the songs. I liked one of the songs, but the other songs are not my favorite. I thought they were really good. I have to say I'm really disappointed with this album. I think I would have liked it more if I had liked it before. I don't really listen to the radio, but I listen to a lot of music.

Not only are the songs on this album not from the actual "Breaking Bad" soundtrack album, but the songs are the same ones featured in the "Breaking Bad" television series. The only thing that is original are the photos. I don't know why anyone would want an album that looks like it was sold from the "Breaking Bad" TV series.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really enjoy the music in this "Breaking Bad" soundtrack. It's a nice mix of songs from the TV show and some original songs. I really enjoyed listening to the entire album.

Amazon review: This cover art is fake. It looks like an old cover, but I know it's fake. I bought this CD thinking it was the "Breaking Bad" soundtrack CD, but it is not. It was a copy of the CD that was sold at the local store. I would like to see Amazon get their act together.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: i have been listening to this album for several weeks now, and i feel it's a beautiful masterpiece and very emotional. i was not expecting to feel something like this, but i was pleasantly surprised. it's a very personal album, and you have to listen to it at least a few times to get the entire story. it's not always easy to hear the lyrics, but i've always found that i can hear them and appreciate the music more and more as i go along.

Amazon review: Wow, i just realized that i have written a very negative review of a super album and i don't even know why. this album is amazing, and i don't want to write a review at all. i feel it's more of an album than a single song. i've heard this song a million times throughout the last few weeks and it is amazing. i don't know how many times i've mentioned it to people throughout the past few months.

Amazon review: This is an amazing song. I have heard this song hundreds of times and it has always moved me. I just love the way she sings and the way it fits with the song. I also love the way it starts out and then is quiet all the way through. I wish I would have known who wrote this song before I listened to it. I love how it starts out and then goes quiet. It makes me want to listen to the rest of the album.
