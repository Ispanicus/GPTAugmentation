Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: One of the best music albums in quite some time.  I love the different versions of the same songs, but the fact that they were all recorded at different times and on different instruments gives a unique quality to many of the songs.  I've listened to this album hundreds of times and each one is just as good as the previous.  The vocal track in the back of the CD is the best part of it all.  I have listened to this album over and over and it never fails to impress.  I love it.  I love the singer, and I love her voice.  This is the album for you if you love Christmas music.  I can't wait until it comes out.  And if you like her voice, she is a great singer.  You don't need to be in a choir, but you do need to have one of those voices.  They make great background singers for any number of songs.  She is like a different singer in every song.  She has a range that is amazing.  She is the best singer of all time- at least for me.  This is a great album if you like Christmas music- you will love it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned that the bass line in the song is difficult to get in the mix.  The bass line is there, its just that it's a little bit hard to make it sound perfect.  Just put it on the left or right of the mix and it will be fine.  If you're looking to record a band and have them sound perfect, I'd suggest to use a professional studio, you'll have much better results.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Another example of a reviewer who had no idea what he was talking about.  This disc was released by Sony in 1983 on a jewel case with original artwork.  There is no evidence of this album being recorded live as the music is virtually all studio work.

Amazon review: Nothing of great importance is actually said here.  The band is essentially a re-release of their first album, with the addition of a couple of new tracks.  It's not the most original or interesting record in the world, but it does have some of the bands best songs in it.  It's not the worst, either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is an excellent album.  It shows great musical ability and shows off the talent of young musicians who need to take their passion and channel it into something constructive.  The album goes from heavy metal to pop music and back to metal.  There is enough variation in the overall sound and the song selection to make the album interesting.  I do not see the appeal in this album for anyone outside of the band's fan base, though I could be wrong.  It's not a bad record, just a little bland. If you like good music, or anything that you like to listen to, this is your album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great album for all ages.  I don't understand why people find this album to be boring, but that's just my opinion.  The overall sound is great.  The songs are good, but I think the album could have been better.  There are some songs that are good, and there are some that are just bland.  I know it's a hard rock album, but that's what I like.  I would have liked to have heard more songs with lyrics and a little more variety in the overall sound.  I like the song "I'm Not In Love" the best.  I think the band would have benefited from trying some different sound effects.  The only thing that may bother some people is the fact that this album is more of a pop album than a hard rock album.  There is a lot of radio friendly music, but they also have a few pop songs.  That's the thing that makes this album good.  If you like pop music, this is a good album to listen to.  The lyrics aren't that great, but I could be wrong.  I don't understand the comments that say this is boring.  I don't think it's boring.  I think the songs are good, but I could be wrong.  I don't think this album is a bad album, just a little bland.  I would have liked to have heard more songs with lyrics and more variety in the overall sound.  I do like the songs, and I think the band would have benefited from trying some different sound effects.

Amazon review: Nothing of importance.  The band is basically a re-release of their first album, with the addition of a few more songs.  As with most re-releases, this album isn't bad.  It's not the best, either.  It's a little too short, and I think at some of the track choices the band could have done a little better.  I do like a few of the songs on this album, but there are some that I just don't care for.  The one song that I think is really good and is a little different is "I'm Not In Love".  The song is pretty good, but it's not really innovative.  I do like the song, and I think the band would have benefited from trying some different sound-effects.  There are some songs on this album that are good, and some that I just don't care for.

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

The only way I can explain it is like an "up in the air" type of feeling.  I bought a couple of songs from this CD and they were all great, but when I heard the other songs, I just felt like I was hearing them for the first time.  The cover art of the CD was just as good as the songs themselves.  Like I said, this is a great CD, but it is also a little confusing to find the songs on the CD cover.  I would still recommend this CD to anyone.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###

###
Amazon review: "Baby" and "My Way" are probably the two best songs on this album.  But "Baby" is a little weak, and I would have liked a little more of the original.  "My Way" just seems to be a song of praise of this man, and he doesn't give a song.  I don't like his voice.  He sounds too much like a girl, and I always thought it's better to try to sing like a man for a change.  I think he's a great artist, and I wish he would go back to being a boy...if he can.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It's got a great beat and great lyrics.  Not a lot of words in it, but its a nice song.  And I guess the beat is not too bad either.  The beat is kinda basic, but I think it sounds ok on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Another good song.  The lyrics are good and I think he's singing about his feelings.  I don't think he's singing about anything bad though.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this song.  It's pretty nice, but I don't think it's a very good song.  And again, he doesn't do the lyrics justice.  It doesn't sound like he's writing this song.  It sounds like someone trying to sound like him.  It just sounds like someone trying to sound like him.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I did not like it because I was looking for LP not single. Anyways, I sent it back and I was quickly processed for money return. It was needing more information on the add.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is probably the worst thing I've heard from them.  "Boys Will Be Boys" is beautiful, but all the songs are a little samey.  "It's All In Your Mind" is a little cheesy, but good.  This album is definitely better than their debut.  "Anchor" and "The Beginning" are the best.  The rest of the songs just don't sound good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Just wanted to say that I'm a fan of the band.  I've listened to them before and always enjoyed them.  I'm glad I am going to be able to listen to their new album.  I'll be getting it this month.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "Boys Will Be Boys" was the first song I ever heard from them.  It is a good song.  It's nice to hear them back with a new album.  I'm looking forward to it.

Amazon review: I think the music was boring.  They sounded like a bunch of guys sitting around thinking about girls.  I'm not even sure why I was listening to this.  I'd rather listen to a real band that has some good songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music sucks.  I thought I was gonna like it but it turns out that I hate it.  The vocals aren't good and the drumming is awful.  I'm a fan of The Strokes, but I don't like this band.  The songs aren't catchy enough.  They have the same kind of feel to them.  If I was gonna listen to a band, I'd rather listen to The Strokes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel like this is pretty much exactly what they did before.  It's good to get back to their roots.  I'm hoping that soon they will be able to release new material.  I've been waiting for a while now!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't normally listen to new music, but I was a fan of The Strokes.  I enjoyed them.  This song reminded me of them.  I could listen to a song like this every day.  The only thing I don't like about this song is that it has no melody.  I don't see why the song is so short.  A song like this should be a little longer.  The lyrics aren't that good.  There are a lot of bad things in the world.  I like to listen to bands that write better lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is pretty good.  I really like the music of The Strokes.  I like the fact that their songs aren't always the same.  I think that's why I liked them so much.  I love the way this song is put together.  The song sounds good on the radio.  I hope that they can release more songs like this.  That would be the best.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the fact that this song doesn't sound like the rest.  It doesn't sound like "Boys Will Be Boys" or "It's All In Your Mind".  It sounds like a totally different song.  It's nice to hear something really different.  I'm not sure why the song is so short.  It seems like a song should be longer.  The lyrics aren't that good.  There are a bunch of things that they say that are really stupid.  You can hear them on the radio.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  Wow! What a great song!  It's just so different than anything I've heard.  I really like it.  It's very powerful.  I'm excited to hear more songs from them.  I've heard "Anchor" and "The Beginning" before.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the sound of this song.  It's very good.  It's really good.  It's nice to hear a different song.  I am very excited to listen to more of their music.  I've heard "Boys Will Be Boys" and "Take Me Away" before.  As far as their new album, I hope it will be better than "Boys Will Be Boys" and "It's All In Your Mind".  I hope to hear more songs from them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.
