Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The music on this album is wonderful.  The choral work is excellent.  The instrumentation is excellent.  The only thing I would point out on this album is that the album repeats a few times.  I get the feeling that they are using the same melody several times and you need to pause and re-listen to the song before starting again.  The song "The City of New Orleans" is very powerful and is beautiful to listen to.

Amazon review: I bought this CD on release date because I thought it was a great CD and I was really impressed.  I have a huge problem with some of the commercial recordings that are sold on CD, but I wasn't really aware of the fact that this CD was a commercial recording.    I got the CD and took it out of the package.  I played it and listened to it for a few minutes and then put it back and started to play it once again.  It was really obvious that it was a commercial CD.  There were many times when it was very loud and at other times it was quiet.  If the CD had been labeled in the way it should have been, it would have been much better. I would rate this CD at 3 out of 10.

I am happy that they continue to make this type of music and have not changed it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Meghan Trainor and I really like the album. While I think she has a unique style, I can't help but feel like I've heard her songs before.

I think it is great that other artists have the opportunity to sing her songs and this makes it all the more interesting.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: What I like about this album is that it is a blend of both western and classic christian music.  I like the fact that it is about a young man who was a cowboy.  It seems like a typical western musical theme, but is something that is new and different.  I like the fact that it is set in the 1800's.  The music does have a lot of influences from folk music and traditional christian music.  Overall, I really enjoy this album.  It was a while since I have listened to such a great album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of both Clint Eastwood and R. Kelly.  I have both of their albums on cassette tape and have listened to them over and over again.  This album is a mix of both of their albums.  I really like that the music is a mixture of both.  The album starts off with a great song called "Heartbeat" by Clint, but then the music becomes more rock and roll and R. Kelly's music is more of a traditional christian gospel song.  This is a really good album and I love it.  I am going to get the next R. Kelly album right away.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "Heartbeat" is a great song and an excellent album.  The music is very different, but the lyrics are great.  The music is very simple and seems to be more rock and roll.  The song is very catchy.  The lyrics are very well written and very spiritual.  The music is very simple and has a simple rhythm.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the classics or the new rock and roll.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a great blend of the traditional christian music with the western sound.  The music is very relaxing and very easy to listen to.  The CD has a great amount of different instrumentals from the traditional christian band.  The choral leader has a great voice and seems to be very good at playing the various instruments.  At times, the music can seem very boring, but it always seems to come together.  It is an excellent CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Thalia is the sort of female singer who could probably pull off an Aria or a Concerto for the Left Handed. The quality of this album is as good as the last. If you are looking for a great voice, a good recording and a good artist then you have found her.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I just purchased this album and I'm not quite sure what to expect. I've never bought an Eminem album before, and I'm not quite sure how to take these lyrics. I know the lyrics aren't politically charged, but I don't feel like this is a typical Eminem album. I'm not sure I'm ready to just listen to this album completely. I wonder if it will be like listening to a typical Eminem album. I really like the songs and the lyrics.

Amazon review: I've started listening to music for the first time while driving. It's not really a good idea to start driving while listening to music. You might get in an accident.

Amazon review: I'm sure this is an Eminem album that isn't about politics.  I just don't like what I hear. I would like to hear the songs that he is singing about.  I'm tired of the politics in rap music. I'm tired of the songs about the same old problems. I'm tired of rap music that is just a lot of songs. I would like to hear some stories. I don't hear much of that on this album. I guess this album is for the people who like rap music, and not the people who like the politics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  I got it about 2 years ago, and I still love it.  I think it's good for the soul.  I listened to it while driving, and then I listened to it while doing chores.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first album from Eminem that I have ever listened to.  I've tried to get into Eminem before but I always just don't get it.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great opera.  If you like music that pushes your emotions to the max, this is a must.  I think the  whole thing is a bit over the top but it's all good.  I'm waiting for the CD to come out so I can give it a good listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Just a few weeks ago, this was ranked as the 5th Best Album of the Year by all of the sites I frequent. I really don't understand how this album, which was released at the height of the mid 90s grunge craze, is on the level of the best albums of the last 30 years.

Amazon review: I've heard the new "Cantor" CD three or four times now and have yet to find a CD that can compete with it for sheer awesomeness.  I can't resist the catchy songs - I have some of their CDs in my car, along with some of my own.  The original CD (Cantor) was released in April of 1999 and was recorded by a group that I hadn't heard of.  The group is called Tuxedo Junction and the CD is called Tuxedo Junction.  I received the CD as a Christmas gift.  I have been listening to the CD regularly and I have to say that I have come to like it.  It's hard for me to put into words exactly how I feel about this CD.  I love the way that John, the leader of the band, brings the songs together and how he creates a cohesive sound.  I love the way that the songs are written and sung.  I love the fact that the band has the ability to switch from a slow, slow tempo to a fast, fast tempo.  The songs "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" and "You and I" are very, very good examples of this.  I love the songs "Cantor" and "Fiesta de Pancho Villa".  The song "Tu Y

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I've really enjoyed this CD all week.  I don't know about the "in your face" approach I have to the song "Smooth Criminal."  I do like the "new" version of "Lose Yourself."  I don't know if I can sing for the Lord, but I know I can sing for myself, and I can't do it as well as some other people do.  I can really relate to the lyrics.  I am very happy that I got to work with such an outstanding and talented instructor as Cyney Davis.  Very informative and creative.  I'm looking forward to her next CD.  She does a great job teaching, which is so important for all our singers.  I don't know if she can sing or not, but I know she's gifted in the way that she puts her voice to use in singing.  I am going to have a hard time waiting for the new album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is the best I've ever heard a woman sing!  It is very smooth and warm, yet very sexy.  I think Thalia should have a word with her husband.  He is not a very good singer.  I would really like to work with her again.  She has a great voice.

Amazon review: Brought it because my sister and I were listening to it the previous night.  This is the first CD I have ever bought on Amazon.  I think it was worth the little bit of money.  The lyrics are really clear, and I would have no problem singing it without a guitar.  The sound is pretty good!  I didn't know that Amazon allows you to "customize" the order.  I've never used this feature before. Will have to take a look into it.

Amazon review: This song is just ok.  Not great, just ok.  The singing is okay.  I'm not a huge fan of the guitar, but it doesn't make any real difference.  The sound on this song is great.  I didn't know that the songs in the back of CDs are a little bit cheaper than those at the beginning.  I wasn't going to buy it, but it was free with my return from my sister.  I will probably get another song on Amazon to replace it, but I'm not looking forward to it.  I really liked the sound of this song on my computer, though.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Christian music, and this song is one of my favorites.  It is also one of the few songs that I have never learned to play.  I could have easily started with this song and learned the chords.  However, I don't have a guitar, and I found myself needing to learn the chords.  I have also never made a recording of this song.  I would never put a CD up on my website without me recording it.  I was trying to do a little bit of promotion for this site, and I thought this song was a good thing to put up for download.  I would not suggest doing this song on your website, but would suggest recording it and putting it up on your website.  I did download the song, but I did not play it.  I could have learned the chords, and I would have been able to play it on my guitar, but I found myself learning the chords anyway.  This was only the second CD I have ever bought on Amazon.  I will be purchasing another song to replace this one.  This is a CD I would recommend to just about everyone.

Amazon review: I had to get this song, because my brother was sick, and needed to hear a song to cheer him up.  I am not a huge fan of the guitar, and have only played the chords.

This is the first CD I have ever bought on Amazon, and I am glad I did.

Amazon review: This song is a good way to end your day!  I don't care if you are into Christian music, I wouldn't turn this off unless you were in bed.  I would purchase it as a gift for anyone I know who likes to play the guitar.  This is one of the few songs that I would not turn off on my computer.  It is a good song to end the day on, and even though the voice is somewhat strange, I would not turn this off unless you were in bed.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because my son has a little one who plays the guitar.  I got him the CD, and I thought he would feel better to have it in his room.  However, I can't say that he does.  I am not very fond of the guitar, but this song is not really that bad.  While I don't really like the voice, I think it is a good song.  I would probably get another song on Amazon to replace this one.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this CD when I was looking for good music to listen to while I was waiting for my new job.  I was really excited to listen to this CD.  I was surprised when the CD was not very good.  I started to get to the end of the CD and realized it was boring to listen to.   I was hoping for a great album, but this was disappointing. I got a lot of CDs to listen to and I can't stop listening to them.  I'll keep buying the cd and trying to be a better person.  I guess I need to spend time with music differently.  I've been listening to music my whole life and I was hoping to make better art.  I guess I'm not as creative as I thought.  I am excited to go to a new job since I am going to be so much happier.  I hope I can find music I like and that the new job is a good one.
