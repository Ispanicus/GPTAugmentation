Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I hope Lady Gaga's new single "Born This Way" will be the last of her new releases for a while.  I really don't like this song.  It's just not my taste.  I don't even like the music video.  It's a little too much of a copout for me.  I don't think Gaga can make a new hit single that will satisfy me.  I've heard her latest album is good, but it's not like "The Fame" is a great album.  It's alright, but not great.  You could tell that Gaga really needs to shake up her music.  I hope she does.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album until I saw the album cover, which was very obviously another cover of a pop artist's album.  I expected something a little bit more artistically interesting.  What I got was a lot of the same songs that I had already heard, yet with different titles.  But I did like the new tracks.  "My Heart Will Go On" and "I Don't Want to Be Me".  I really don't know if I will like this album all the way through.  I won't be the only person who doesn't like it, so I'll just have to hope that the rest of the world will like it enough to make it a big hit.  I don't really like pop music, I don't like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, so I'm not going to rush to buy this album.  But I will be very happy with the fact that it's not my favorite pop artist.  As it is, I don't think it has improved since the first album.  It's not even one-sided as the first album.  It's all of her, the same songs, with different titles.  But it's interesting, and if I do like it, I will enjoy it.  I really don't like Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, but it's not my fault that they are successful.  I can't change their music to not like them.  If I could, I would.  But I can't. I just have to live with the music I do like.  But I will be very happy with this album, if it's a hit and I'm not the only one who doesn't like it.  I also won't be the only person who won't like it, because it will not be the biggest hit of the year, but it will be a big hit.  And I won't be the only person who won't be surprised by it.

Amazon review: This album is a little too long for my tastes.  I like the first three songs, but I just don't like this album.  I don't know why, but it just doesn't appeal to me.  And I really don't know what the big deal is.  I will probably buy it by accident, or at least I hope I will.  So to me, this album is not as bad as it could have been.  But it's not good either.  I just can't get into it.  It's not my favorite album either.  I just don't think this album is worth buying.

I'm not a big fan of pop music so I'm not going to be a fan of this album either.  It's not much worse than most pop albums though.  I've heard that Gaga doesn't like to write pop music either.  I don't know what I'm going to do with this album.

"The Girl Who Cried" is one of my all time favorite songs. It is a song about self doubt and loss and how one can face their own demons. I like to play it in the background at all times when I work out. It helps me to focus a bit better and makes me feel like I am getting better.

It is also a great song for an eulogy to send out to those you love. For example, you could play it for your mom or grandma when they are sick. Also, it would be a great song to play at your wedding. It is one of those songs that will last for a very long time.

The song is all about the power of love, but is also about the power of self doubt.

"The Boy Who Cried" was written by Bob Dylan (lyrics) and is a great song about a boy who lost his father. The song has a very haunting melody which makes me remember my own father, and the pain and turmoil that he went through as a child. He was a tough kid who had a very good sense of humor so the song is very appropriate for a funeral.

"The Girl Who Cried" is also a great song to play at a funeral. It is a song about a girl who lost her father and is having problems with herself. The girl has trouble believing that she is strong enough to be a mother and that she is capable of being a good mother. The song gets her through the tough times and helps her to be strong enough to be a good mother.

Both songs are very emotional but very powerful.

I highly recommend that you purchase these two songs and have them played at your next funeral, a wedding, or your own eulogy.

"The Girl Who Cried" is a great song to play at funerals. The song is all about the power of love, but is also about the strength of your own self doubt.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I have a friend who had to go to Italy to have his heart bypass.  He called me and told me he had the book to read.  I said, "You gotta read it."  He is a huge baseball fan, and has been for years.  He is the kind of person who will read a book just to see if it is worth reading.  I told him to read this book.  He read it, and loved it.  It took him two weeks to get through it.  I think he will be happy to have it.  I told him to get a book for when he goes to Italy because he will not know what to do, but if he does, he will definitely read it.  I asked him about his book and he told me he is writing a book.  I will buy that book, he said.  He bought the book online, put it in a box, and mailed it to me.  He is the kind of person who will not go to a bookstore, but a library.  I am the kind of person who will call the library and ask if they have a book by the author.  They say yes, and I am the kind of person who will buy it.

Amazon review: I bought this one to support the local school.  The author is not a millionaire, but has written a book about how we live today.  I have read it and it is very good.  I bought the book because I wanted to support the school.  I am a teacher and I want to be more involved in the world.  I have been to other schools who have used this book.  I have to say, I have not found any of the facts in this book.  I have not found anything about what the students can do with their lives.  I have been to a school where I did not learn anything about the world around me, where there is no discussion about current world events.  I have never seen a lesson plan.  I have been to a school that had been in existence for ten years, where the principal used to read a book about the world before school.  In the past, the students knew that the world existed, but did not know anything about it.  I went to a school that was in a different city, where the students did not know anything about the world around them, and the world existed but did not have a teacher to discuss it.  I found the book to be very inspiring.  The book has sparked a lot of personal growth in me.  The author is an amazing person.  I love this book and I would like to see it become more widely known.

Amazon review: I have been a big fan of the music of The Replacements and I loved them when they first came out.  I have been a big fan of The Clash since the 50's, when I first saw them in concert.  I have been a big fan of The Beatles since the 60's.  I went to a concert by them in the 70's, and was blown away.  I had never seen anything like that before.  I wanted to go see them again, but the tickets were gone.  I started looking for the album, and I found it on a used CD in a store.  I bought it and was able to get the album from the seller.  It was still in its original packaging, and I bought it from the seller.  I had never realized the importance of second hand records.  It is sad that there are so many used CD's out there.  I have had so many good times with my music.  I have been using my music as a way to help me get through difficult times in my life.  I have to say, that was the first time I ever thought that maybe I could be a musician.  I always knew that I wanted to be an artist, but I always thought I would have to wait for my talent to show up.  I started school in September, and have been very busy.  I have not been a musician because I could not get a job.  I have a lot of money, and I could not get a job because of my lack of talent.  That is why I started my band.  I was going to go to school, but I never did.  It is very sad that I have not had the talent to get a job that paid me well, but I have been very busy.  I have been working in a store in the past, and I have been very busy.  I have been very busy with school, and music.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: This album is a must for any person who is looking for more Christmas music. They did not cut any of the songs that were performed on the radio or movie soundtracks.

There are some really good songs, some really bad songs, some really good songs, and some that are just flat out mediocre. There is something for everyone. The album is very well produced also.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Shelby, we are in the process of converting our website to an on-line store with a payment gateway. We are also in the process of creating a new store for our book line. There are still some outstanding issues we need to address before we can get your book out.

The new book line is still in development and still in need of an editor. We have a few people interested in reviewing the book line. We would like to have your input on the title and the concept.

We are also in the process of creating a new website for our ebooks and digital downloads. The new website will have a new look and a new look will be added to the book line.

I would like to keep you informed about our progress. I can be reached through email at shelbymcnaughton@gmail.com or by calling me at (918) 843-4499.

Amazon review: This CD is a compilation of the songs from Michael Franti's album "The Franti Brothers Live in Concert."  Very good, except for the last song, which is a complete waste of time, especially for a CD with a lot of other worthy songs on it (like "The Franti Brothers Live in Concert," "The Franti Brothers Live in Concert," and "The Franti Brothers Live in Concert" and the album "The Franti Brothers Live in Concert").

Amazon review: I bought this album because I was really anxious for Michael Franti to release an album of new material.

I didn't know much about Michael Franti before I purchased it, other than he's known for singing "The Franti Brothers" and his vocals are incredible.  And then I started to listen to it.  It's not Michael Franti's best work, nor is it his best CD.  And it certainly doesn't deserve to be in my top three of his best CD's.  It's just a good CD.  It's a good CD that should have been released in the spring, not the fall, and certainly not in the winter.

It's no surprise to me that people who listen to Michael Franti think his songs are good, but they just don't stand out enough to make me want to continue listening.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album contains a lot of songs I like.  But it's also a lot of songs that are overrated and just plain bad.  The songs are okay, but the songs are just not a good fit for the album as a whole.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only thing I can say about this album is that Michael Franti is a great singer.  And he's a great writer as well.  The only problem with his writing is that he's not the best at writing the songs that he needs to write.  In other words, he doesn't have an A+ writing skill.  Maybe that's why he doesn't have the best songs.  But even then, his songs are still great.  I'm no Michael Franti expert, but it's great to hear his songs.

Amazon review: This album was released before I knew much about Michael Franti.  But this CD really had me confused.  It was released at the same time as a Michael Franti live album.  I was really excited to hear a new live album.  And then I heard this album.  It was such a letdown.  I guess I just shouldn't have been so excited over a Michael Franti album that had been out of print for over a year.
Sentiments: Negative

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I was really happy to learn that Michael Franti's new album was being released and that I could

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I was excited to get this, but I really wasn't expecting much. I have to say I'm very glad I purchased this product because I received a very well received gift. I'm not even sure if it's the right item, but I can tell the quality is great. I was a little disappointed to not receive the DVD. I have no doubt that I would have received it had I received it as a gift, but it would have been nice to know.

Amazon review: I just wanted to mention how great I feel about this site. I am a huge Beatles fan and I love everything about the Beatles. And I love John Lennon too. Everytime I get a Beatles CD, I have to listen to it over and over again. And I don't get tired of it by the end. It is like music to me. I have received nothing but the best. I have received nothing but perfect service and great products. I have received nothing but the best. Thank you.
