Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I don't really have a problem with the songs themselves but I have a problem with the fact that you can't tell if it's a CD or a tape.  I didn't bother to download it because it was only a few bucks but I could have downloaded it instead of giving it to my kids to play.  So, I don't have the right to complain.  I'll be interested to see if it becomes available again, but I do think it's a good album.  It is a little cheesy but there are several good songs.  And I have to give credit where credit is due, they are not afraid to let you know that they were recorded in a studio.  The singer's voice is nice and she sings well.  She sings on key and her voice is strong.  I think there are some good songs and her voice is good.  But the songs don't make sense.  I don't have that feeling that there is a "message" in the songs.  The first song is the best and the others are OK.  The CD is a good one.  I don't think I will be buying any more music from them.

Amazon review: In the past, I have made up my mind about CD's that I wanted to review them on the site.  I was reluctant to write a review because I was afraid I would offend the person I was reviewing.  I decided that I would just write the review and then post it on the site so that people could read it.  I am embarrassed to admit it, but I am always ashamed when I write reviews.  I am not really sure what my problem is.  Maybe it's because I don't know what I like or dislike.  But I just don't know how to describe myself.  I guess I don't know what I like and dislike.  I guess that's why I write reviews.  It's probably not very nice, but it's something I do.  When I was writing the review, I was thinking about how I don't know what I like and dislike.  I don't know how to do that and I don't know why I do it.  I guess I am just a coward and I don't like to admit that.  I don't want to sound like a jerk.  I guess I just don't like being embarrassed.  Maybe if I had an honest answer, I could write better reviews.  But I haven't been able to figure out the answer yet.  I guess I just never knew how to say the one thing I really wanted to say.  Maybe I am a coward.

Amazon review: I have always been a singer, with only a little experience, but a lot of interest.  In fact, I started writing songs when I was 15.  They were about 50 percent about my life, and 50 percent about my love for my wife.  I have always been good at music, but I had to learn a lot.  I started out playing the alto saxophone in high school, but I was not good.  I tried to play the flute a lot, but I was not good at it either.  In high school, I played the clarinet, but I wasn't any good at it either.  So, when I got to college, I got a trumpet.  I really wanted to play the trumpet, but I didn't know how.  In college, I had to learn how to play guitar.  I tried to learn guitar, but I couldn't do it.  I couldn't play it like a normal person.  I was always trying to practice my fingering, but I didn't get any better.  So, I stopped trying.  I really liked music and I just didn't have any other choice.  I had to learn how to read music, how to play the piano, how to read sheet music, how to sing, how to play an instrument, how to play the flute, how to sing, how to play an instrument, how to play an instrument, how to play the flute, and how to read sheet music.  I was trying to learn just about everything I could learn.  It took me a couple of years before I could read music and write music on the piano.  I had to go to a music theory professor when I got to college to learn how to read music.  I played the trumpet in high school and college, but I was not a good trumpet player.  So, I had to learn how to play a trumpet.  I tried the trombone in college, but I wasn't any good at it either.  When I went to a music theory professor at college, I had to learn how to play the trombone.

Amazon review: First off, I have never purchased a cd before and after reading the description of this CD, I knew immediately that I would be buying this. I was blown away by the song "The Wedding Song" because I have a son who is going to be married in September and this song is so appropriate and fitting for their wedding. I also loved the album cover, which had me thinking "oh wow, I'm really going to like this CD" but then...I actually didn't like it at all. I loved the album cover, but the album itself is bland, boring, and over all a little boring. It's not a bad CD, but I'm disappointed that they would put this album out as a one time purchase to get people into what they are doing in the church. The music is beautiful, but I would rather buy a CD that is a little more "dramatic" like "The Wedding Song" or "The Wedding" or "I Belong To You" or "Jesus, Redeemer, Savior". I'm sorry but after reading the description of this CD, I was so excited to buy it, but after listening to the album and seeing the cover, I was disappointed in the idea of "going to the store" and buying it.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have been to the top of Mt. Washington, and I have climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro.  This is good music.  It is a collection of classical music.  It is not too expensive.  The songs are arranged to be performed in the same manner as the original concert.  Each song is performed by a different artist.  There are two singers. I like the sound of the female voice better.  I was disappointed that I could not find as many arrangements for the piano as I had hoped for.  In other words, I liked the arrangements but I was disappointed that there were not a lot of them.  In any event, I am pleased with the concert.  I think it would be great for someone who enjoys classical music.   The recording is very good.  I have listened to it several times, and each time I am amazed at how good it is.   I would say this is a good value.  However, I would not consider it a must have.  I think this is a good collection for the price.  There is a lot of excellent music in this set.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: This collection is excellent and should be in every adult's library.  It is the perfect collection for the music lover.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

For me, this soundtrack is the perfect balance of the movie and the songs. I have no complaints about this soundtrack, other than possibly the fact that they seem to be doing a little too much of both. The movie is great and has great music, but to me, the songs take the back seat. This is a great soundtrack, and a great way to enjoy Hamilton.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was amazed by how much I love this opera.  I felt it was worth the money.  It's not just a case of "buy it, love it, or don't buy it."  It's more like "love it, but don't buy it."  I actually feel like I'm in love with this guy.  I will not buy it again.  I will not ever buy it again.  I just feel like it's a real loss to Amazon.

Amazon review: I've always hated this opera.  I hate that it is so cheap, so I never buy it.  I bought it because it was at the top of my Amazon wishlist.  But I was really unhappy with it.  It's basically just a series of arias and recitatives.  The whole opera is one big ballad.  I liked the idea of it being a romantic comedy, but the execution was just so bad, I couldn't even buy it.  I am a music fan, but I just didn't find the opera funny or touching.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this opera for years.  I love it.  I have a large number of it in my mp3 collection.  I've listened to it in the car, driving here, driving there, in my apartment, on the subway, and in the rain, to and fro, and on my way home after work.  I have loved every note!  I love the music.  I love the voices, even when played by the human voice, or even a singing computer, they sound like they're alive!  They just come alive and sound like they're from another world!  I love the singing, the voices, in this opera, I love the fact that the voices are more than just human voices.  They seem to have a spirit, a soul.  What a wonderful way to do a story.  I can't explain this opera.  I just know that I am in love with it!

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this opera.  It is my favorite opera.  I have even bought a CD of it, because I can't live without it!  Love it!

Amazon review: I didn't really get it.  I am a song writer and I can write a song that would be a hit record.  I wish I could get some feedback on my songs like others have.  I can't do it.  I wrote the first 3 songs of my album with a guitar.  The first one was a sad song.  The second one was all about the drugs and I wrote that song about how I feel that everyone has the blues.  It is also about a girl that I loved.  I was talking to her on the phone one day and she said "Why don't you play the blues?"  She meant my music.  I said how would I know if I was playing the blues or not.  I had to ask her, so she said, "You have to play it, and if you don't, then you are playing the blues."  I was like OK, I'll play it.  I wrote another one about the girl.  The third song is about how I am going to die, that I am going to be taken by the police.  I was talking to her one day and she told me to play that song.  I did and she said, "You are playing the blues."  I said, "No, I was saying it and I don't know why I said it."  She said, "You should play it just to see if you really want to play the blues."  I said, "I don't need to know whether I am playing the blues or not.  I am playing all the time."  I don't know why she said that.  She was right.  I am playing the blues.

Amazon review: I really really enjoy this song.  I have not done any songs for a few years.  I get together with my friends.  Our friend John Paul Jones, the guitarist, played me most of his songs.  He put together a cd which had me on a couple of songs.  What happened I was not happy about playing them and then I took the cd away and put it in my car.  I was driving around and I thought, "I am gonna have to get off of this damn road and get off of this damned road."  So I put the cd in my car and went home.  I put it in my cd player and I played it.  It was a really good song.  It was one of the songs I put together of his songs.  His songs were a part of my life and so I always liked to hear them.  I got a lot of really good songs.  I had always played them on the guitar.  I don't know why I didn't put them together.  I just put them in my car and I didn't play them.  I just thought, "OK, I am going to start playing them and put them together."  I had a lot of them and I just didn't play them.  They are really great songs.  I love him and he is a great man.

I have been writing all my life and am now a full-time freelance web writer. I love writing about music and have written for a number of music websites. My first site was at www.cdbaby.com. I now write for a number of other sites including www.thesoundtrack.com where I have written for several years now, and www.pianobit.com. I have also written for a number of UK music magazines. My aim is to write about music that is interesting and I believe most of the music that I write about is. I look forward to hearing from you and hope you enjoy reading my writing.

Songs for Christmas in the carol style are so popular that it is impossible to choose just one to include in this list. However, there are a few that I find to be particularly suitable for carols that are sung during the Christmas season.

I have written a few original Christmas songs myself. They are all very personal and are written for specific occasions and for a specific audience. I always try to have them written for the people who would be singing them. I would recommend that you read my original Christmas songs, then listen to the ones included here, and then read my book, which includes a number of original Christmas songs. If you would like to order some copies of my book, please use the following link: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Christmas-Songs-Carol-Book-ebook/dp/B00D4DQFZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470777825&sr=8-1

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After reading the reviews, I am glad to read that it is a good cd to learn God's Word. The songs are very good, and the lyrics are very good. However the only song I would like to listen to more is the song called "Let The Worshipers Arise". While listening to this song, I could not help but think about the fact that God has made it possible for us to worship Him on the earth. I believe that we all have so much to offer Him and that He wants us to be aware of this fact. I also believe that the music we listen to, and the words we speak should be in agreement with the words we sing and the words we write. I would like to thank the CD label for giving us a great cd with great songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I can't believe I just had to give this album 5 stars.  I have been listening to this album since March and it has not been a waste of my time.  I truly believe that if they can release a new album with a little more diversity, I will be the first in line to buy it.

Amazon review: After learning about Schubert, I realized how far away from my musical tastes I was, and decided to take a listen to a few of his works. After hearing The Trout, I found it to be a very enjoyable experience.  I listened to this album over and over again, especially the Schubert songs. I found the music to be very entertaining, and the songs very captivating.    This is one of my favorite albums of the year.

Amazon review: This album from the group, The Misfits, does not deserve 5 stars because the music sounds like the band from the 80's.  What I find very interesting is that they have a completely different sound than the 80's bands that they tried to emulate.  I do not think that The Misfits will ever be as big as the other 80's bands that they try to emulate.

I do not believe that this will ever make it to the mainstream.

Amazon review: One of the worst of the worst.  The song "Bagabag" is a terrible example of what this album is all about.  A song that is more of a hip hop song with a chorusing chorus than anything else.  Thalia does not have a single note that sounds like she is singing or even singing for that matter.  She is just singing the lyrics over the beat that was played on the beat box.  If Thalia did not have a voice of a fish, she would be the most annoying and annoying woman in the world.

You can tell that this person is drunk.  Not one note of the song was played correctly and the chorus was just a bunch of shit with no rhyme or reason behind it.  This is a terrible song.
