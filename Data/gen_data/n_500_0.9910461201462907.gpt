Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good album from an album that is, on the surface, fairly pointless.  However, listen to the songs and you'll get the answer.  The songs are well written and deliver on the promise of the title.  The music is very unique, with the vocal performances being one of the best on the album.

"My favorite album"

If I had to pick my favorite album of all time, it would be this one. I'm not crazy about the sound, but I love the lyrics and music. I don't think every musician is a lyricist or a composer, but this is not one of those albums. He's not a musician, he's a singer-songwriter. He has a voice that's pure, he has a way with words. It's not perfect, but there is not a bad song on this album.

What did you love best about The Blackout?

I love the fact that it's just an album that has a lot of stuff in it. I love the fact that you can get a lot of different things from the album. I love it because it doesn't try to be one thing. It just is one thing. It has the best songs of all metal albums, and a lot of the other albums don't have any songs that are just as good.

The Blackout

It has to be the best debut album ever made.

0 of 0 people found this review helpful.

I don't know about my opinion, but I'll give it a shot. I was looking for a debut album to buy for my oldest. He's a big horror fan and we had the best time watching the movies. I don't know if he'll like this one. I don't know if he'll like it. It's just a starting point for him. I don't know if he'll like it. I just know he'll love it. When I was looking for it, I could not find any reviews. When I found out the album was coming out, I knew it would be his first album. I didn't know it was going to be one that he would love so much. I had no idea what his favorite bands were going to be. When I found out about this album, I couldn't wait to hear it. My dad gave it to me, saying it was his favorite debut album. I don't know if it is. I don't know if I'll like it. I don't know if I'll love it. It might not even be his favorite. But he's a grown man, he's not a baby anymore. I just think that this album is going to be a good one for him. It's just a start for him.

The first review I ever read was on this album, so I had to buy it, even though I didn't really like it. I was like, "It's gonna be weird, it's gonna be awesome, it's gonna be fantastic." I really didn't know

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

I've seen him in concert, and he's good.  I just wish he would be more like this when he's on stage.  I feel his songs have a lot more to them, and it's good to hear something new from him.  I also like that there is no rap, so it doesn't get annoying.  If he would rap, that would really take this song out of the air.  I wish he would do more shows.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Amy Winehouse. The reason why I like her is that she's the perfect mix of cool and girly.  I loved 'Perfect' just because it was Amy, but the album itself was a mixed bag.  I liked 'Beautiful' a lot... but the rest were just ok.  I don't think Amy has much to offer but I can respect that.  This album has two songs that are really good, 'The World is Yours' and 'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'.

I was pleasantly surprised as I thought she'd do the same thing that I did with the first album - just make more of the same songs.  'Some Nights' is a good example.  She tried too hard to do the same thing with it as the first album.  I think she just wanted to get back with her pop sound.  She has a sweet voice, but it just doesn't have the pop/pop heart that the first album had.  But the songs are still really good and I really like 'Love Me Like You Do'.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: I'm quite disappointed in how this song started out.  I was under the impression that I was buying the song for Christmas. I really wanted to love it, but I ended up not liking it. When the chorus came around, I was like, "eh, what's the point?"  It just didn't interest me.  I was hoping that it would move me, but it didn't.  I am not an over the top person by any means.  I am just a person who likes to enjoy music in a positive manner.  I was hoping for something more meaningful, but I didn't get it.

Amazon review: This is not a good song.  Its a very generic song.  I'm not a fan of Lady Gaga at all.  The lyrics in this song are very annoying and offensive.  The song is not a single.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I was surprised at how good the audio quality was.  It was a little off key at first but after a few songs I figured out what I was doing wrong in the next songs.  The music was good, but I think it would be better if it wasn't so mellow.  It was a nice relaxing meditative type of song, but the only downside to it was that I wanted to put it in my car as it was the only MP3 player that would play it at a reasonable volume.

Amazon review: No, not true. I've been writing music since 1981, and I know exactly what you mean. I saw the concert and sang along with the crowd and felt very uncomfortable.

Amazon review: I loved it! I do not enjoy when someone sings along to a song I wrote, but I was blown away by the way they sang along. It was very different from the way most bands sing.

They had a very good show and I would have to say it would be a pleasure to see them again. I will be looking forward to it and hopefully I will see them again.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: There are so many songs on this album, I don't know which one to like, but my favorite has been "Smile."  It's sad, but it's a great song and I just love the way it flows.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic.

When I first heard the record it was on vinyl and I was very disappointed to hear the scratches and pops on the vinyl. I was very upset and thought I would never hear these songs on CD again. But I heard it in this condition and I'm very happy that I did.

Amazon review: I just got back from the store with this one and I have to say it's the second worst Maiden album I have ever heard. The song 'Kiss of the Damned' is the worst thing I've ever heard Maiden do. The best song is 'The Final Frontier' but it's very scratchy and the vocals are bad. Still I really like this version of this album and would say buy it if you have a good source.

Amazon review: I am a long time Maiden fan. They are one of my favorite bands. I have two Maiden albums that I have not listened to since the first one I bought in 1983.

Amazon review: I love this band. I used to listen to all of their albums in their entirety. I think I had at least ten at one time. I have been listening to this album non-stop since it came out. I can't say that it's the best Maiden album, but if you love Maiden you should absolutely at least give it a listen. The "Farewell to Adversity" album is one of my favorite Maiden albums.

Amazon review: I'm a Maiden fan, and love listening to their music. The best Maiden albums are "Run to the Hills", "The Final Frontier", and "The Final Programme" but to me this album is the best.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album non-stop since it came out in 1975 when I was a kid. I am glad I got the CD version. I have heard a lot of people say that the CD version is better than the vinyl version. I would say this is true. I like the sound of the CD version better. I wish I could have owned the vinyl version.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: Really misleading. it's more of a 10 minute show than a full length one. Lots of behind the scenes talk but that's about it.

Amazon review: One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: She is the leader of the band.  She is a great vocalist.  I had no idea she was just as good looking. She's got to be the sexiest woman alive.  I'm telling you, she is the Sexiest Woman Alive! I think she's hot. The song is  great.  The lyrics are great. The music is great. It was a great surprise. I've never been that entertained in my life. I didn't know what to think about this song.  
The thing I liked best about it is that it's a real love song  and a real love song can't be just about one person.  When you love someone, you want to sing the song that they love. And that's true with all the songs in this CD. This one speaks about the love that is between two people. I cried. When I first heard it. I was so happy that I just couldn't believe it.  She's an amazing singer.  I love her voice.  The lyrics are just so beautiful. And it's a real song. It's a real song.  
I guess I have a lot to say about this song. It's  a real love song. And it's a real love song,  and it's a real love song.  I really wanted to like this song.  I really wanted to like this song. But in my heart  I know. I can't believe that this song is about a man and a woman.  But my heart says that this song is about two people in love.  I love her voice.  
I think this song is really a beautiful song.  It's a song that speaks of someone's love.  And I think this is a wonderful song.  I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to this song.  I'll just listen to it over and over again.

A: So do I.  I really think that this song is a true love song.  And I think this song is a true love song.  Oh my God!  
A: I can't believe you hate this song.  You are just               a spoiled brat.
