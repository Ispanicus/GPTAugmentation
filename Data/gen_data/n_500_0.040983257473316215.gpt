Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Sentiment: Positive

I'm not sure how to comment on the review. I think it is a very good record. But my personal opinion is that it is not up to par with the best. I have heard that album a few times and each time it is better than the other.

I have to say that I am a huge fan of the Beatles and have listened to them all the way to the very end. They are one of my favorite bands. I have always thought that the best of them was "The White Album" and that is my favorite. Rod Stewart is one of my favorite singers as well. I have always been a fan of his music. But I have to say that I have not heard any of his stuff that I thought was up to par with the others. I am a huge fan of both The Beatles and Rod Stewart. So there are a few things I will say about this album. I think that it is not great. But I can understand the hype that it is getting. I really don't think you can have one of the greatest songs in the history of the world and not have it be a perfect 10. And I don't like the way that Rod is singing the song. It is just too much like a ballad. I think it is a very good record. But I think it is not up to par with the others. I have been a fan of Rod ever since I first heard him. I have never heard any of his stuff that I thought was as good as the others. It is just not as good. But it was one of my favorite records from his career and I am glad I got it for Christmas because it was a very good record.

I own this and am very disappointed with it. I tried to download the song "I'm Not A Player" at the end of the first song and it wouldn't play. So I had to do it again but this time I pressed the play button instead of the download button. It didn't work. So I tried again and this time it worked. It played fine. But it did not work and I have no idea why. I would give it a star if I could.

I am not one who usually listens to music I buy. But I love this album. I love Rod Stewart. I love the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. I love all those great bands from the 60's. I love The Stones. I love The Beatles. But Rod Stewart is my favorite male singer. I love his voice.

Amazon review: The song "Lifesong" is a good song, but it's not as good as the album version.

This review is for the album "The Serenity of Suffering" by the bands "Korn". It was released on March 1, 2000.

This album is a great album. In my opinion, it is the best Korn album ever and probably the best album of all time. I could not put it down. I listened to it for hours. I will post my review later.

This album is the first real return to form for Korn since 1994. This is not a bad album, but it is not a classic either. I would rate this album 5.5 stars. It has a lot of great songs. My favorite song is "The Serenity of Suffering". The album itself is not that good. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a studio (Lifesong, Life is a Lie, Black Hearted Woman, and So Far Away. Some songs are really good. The song "The Losing End" sounds like it was recorded in a studio. This album has a good balance of rock, rap and hip-hop with an average song length. Some songs are really good. The song "The Losing End", however, is awful. It has very little lyrics and is just a bunch of drum beats and random choruses of "oh no!". The song "Lifesong" is not that bad, but it sounds like it was recorded in the studio.

The album is mostly good. The album is not as good as the first two but still not that bad. The album would fit on a regular CD. Most of the songs are short and don't take more than a few minutes to listen to. Even the longer songs are a good length. The album is a little too repetitive at times, but most of the songs are long enough to last an hour.

The album is worth buying if you like rap/hip-hop/hardcore. It is also worth listening to if you like Korn. I would rate this album 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who likes Korn. I would rate it 5.5 stars.

I don't usually review albums, but I just finished listening to this album and thought that I should do it. This album is Korn III. It is the third album by the band Korn. I don't know if there is anything that I can add to any of the reviews that have been done already, so I will just say that I like this album a whole lot!!!! The album starts off with "The Losing End" and is very slow, but then it picks up, and after that there are a lot of really good songs. They are all really good songs. I especially like "The Losing End", "Life is a Lie", "Black Hearted Woman" and "So Far Away." I think the song "The Losing End" is the best song on the album. There are a few other really good songs, but none that I can think of that are better than the songs on the album. The album is very good, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Korn.

I would give this album a rating of 5 stars, but I think the album is worth more than that. I think this album has a lot of great songs, and it is the best Korn album. I would give this album a rating of 5 stars, but I think the CD is worth more than that. I would give this album a rating of 5 stars, but I would rate it 5.5 stars.

This review is for the album "The Serenity Of Suffering" by the bands "Korn". It was released on February 7, 2000.

This album is a great album. In my mind, it is the best Korn album ever, and probably the best of all time. I could not put it down. I listened to the album for hours. I

Amazon review: I have found that Sousa is my favorite musician.  Some of his songs are quite difficult to understand, but I think you could understand him.  I have only tried a few of his songs, but I really like them.  He is a good musician.  He reminds me of my grandfather.  I think he is very talented.  I just wish he would make some kind of record.  I would like to hear that kind of music on the radio.  He does not make any records.  He sings, and it is very relaxing.  I would like to hear him sing again.  I hope he continues to make and record music.  I am listening to many of his songs, and they are great.  He is my favorite musician.  I think he has an amazing voice.  The reason I say this is because I am sitting here in a little park in Atlanta, Georgia, and it is very hot, very hot, very hot.  You can sit in that park and listen to a Sousa song or a Hank Williams song.  Then you have to go home and think about it in a different way.  When I sit in a park or a sun room and listen to a Sousa song, it is a different way.  My mind goes into a different place.  It is like a different state of being.  I find that I want to talk with him.  I like to talk to Sousa.  I love to be with Sousa.  It is fun.  I think he is a very talented musician.  He has a very interesting style.  He is very good at writing songs and making music.  He has written a very good song called "I Can't Keep a Good Man Down."  It was very good and very well received.  It was a hit.  It was very good.  He is very good.  I am very happy that I bought this album.  I have a lot of other Sousa songs, but I just listened to this one.  It was very good.  I hope he makes more records.  I think he should make a record or another album.  I like the way he sings.  I like the way he writes.  I like the way he plays the guitar.  He is very good.  He has a good voice.  He is very good.  I think he is very good at playing guitar.  He is very good.  I hope he continues to make records.  I hope he continues to make music.  It is good.  I hope he continues to make more music.

Amazon review: This is a great album. It was good but not great. The only thing that really made it good was the fact that it was a little less noisy then most of the other albums on this list, although it is still very much a noise. I think this album is good for those who are looking for something to relax them to while they watch some TV, watch some movies, or just put down on a bus or train. If you are a fan of noise and heavy music this is not your album. I will say that if you like something a little different and are looking in a genre that has a lot of noise then this is a good album for you.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a couple of times and I still am impressed by it. I think that this is a good album for anyone who likes heavy music and not necessarily heavy metal. It has a very heavy sound but has a very good amount of variety. The only thing that I don't like about this album is that it has a lot of noise. I would recommend this album for those who like noise music.

Amazon review: This is a very good album. I'm still listening to it. I think it's a good album to listen to when you want to listen to heavy music in the background while you work. I like this album because it can stand on its own as well as be used in conjunction with other albums.

Amazon review: This is an album that I would buy again. It brings to mind the heavy grunge sound that I love. It is not heavy metal or anything of the sort. But it is a very good album. I love the way the musicians play the guitars. There are no other guitarists in the song, it is the guitarists that are playing the solos. This is a great album. I am surprised that I am not more impressed. I would rate this as a 5 out of 5 stars.

Amazon review: This is one of the best heavy metal albums that has ever been released. It is very very heavy. However, it is very very much not "metal".

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

I was always amazed at how much I like his voice and how it makes me feel like singing along. (I am not a great singer). I have heard this CD and I am glad I purchased it. It is a great sound and the songs are all very good. My favorite song is "You Don't Know Me." I love that song and I think that song has the purest of emotions. I think I will listen to this CD again and again. I will continue to buy Josh's CD's. It is a great compilation.

I do like the song "My Heart Beats For You" because I think it is very fitting.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get this CD because it's a new CD from John Legend. I'm not really a fan of his, but this CD was ok. I don't really remember all the songs, but the ones that stuck out to me were the two songs that were on the CD. The song "My Heart Beats For You" was my favorite. The song is sad and sad songs are not my favorite, but I think this one is good. The other song I really liked was "I Don't Know" because it was a little different.

Amazon review: I love the Four Seasons. They're the only group I listen too. I just love the songs, and I listen to them over and over.

I'm not usually a fan of this style of music, and I don't really listen to that style of music. I listen to mostly jazz and I listen to this group of songs.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: It's a nice song, but, it does nothing for me.  I was hoping for a more original song.  I don't know how he found this tune.  I'm sure it's a real "original" song.  It's not even a ballad. It's a "chick anthem."  I don't think it has a single meaning.  I'm sure he wrote it for his wife or something.  I'm not looking for a song that hits that emotional target point.  I'm not a man, I'm not "soulful" so don't bother me with this one.  It's a nice song.  Kinda like the T. Rex song, "Little By Little."

Amazon review: One of my favorite songs of all time! I'm really bummed about this song.  I was hoping that it would be a single.  I'm not disappointed at all though.  I just hope it's not a single.  I think the song is great.  I hope it is one of those "it's a great song, but it isn't a hit single" type of songs.  I don't want to write an entire album dedicated to this kind of song.  I don't want to write an entire album of "I'm not a man, I'm not a singer, I can't sing and I can't play an instrument."

Amazon review: It's a boring song, but it's a nice song.  I know that not everybody likes ballads, but I think this song is really a ballad.  It's just not my thing.  I don't know what to make of this song.  I think it's really sad.  I'm not a religious person, but it seems like a Christian song.  I hope the singer doesn't do it for publicity.  I'm not a fan of the "God is love" message.  I'm not a fan of his songwriting skill either.  I hate songs that have nothing to do with the song's content.  And, the song doesn't have any content to it.  I like the song, but, the lyrics are kind of stupid.

Amazon review: I bought this song and it ended up being a hit.  I'm glad I listened to the CD.  I'm glad that it wasn't a single.  I'm glad the CD is from the '80s.  I'm glad that it's an old song.  It's a really nice ballad.  I thought it was a little better than "Never Be You" which was one of my favorites from the '80s.

I like the way it ends.  I can't listen to it every single time, but, I do like the way the song ends.  I don't know what to make of it.  I like the melody, but, the lyrics are a little strange.

I don't know how he found this tune.  He didn't have to write this song.  It's not his fault that it's not a hit single.  It's not in his wheel house.  His wheel house is "I can't write a good song."  I didn't hear any other good ballads from him while I was listening to the song.  I like the song, but, I don't know how it's going to be a hit when it's just a ballad.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: I think I have the best song ever. I am sure it is one of the best songs ever, but I can't tell you what the song is about because I am too young. I want to play it for my son and tell him what it is about. I want to play it for my daughter and tell her what it is about. I want to play it for my dog and tell him what it is about. I want to play it for everyone I know and tell them what it is about. I want to play it for the world and tell everyone what it is about. This was one of the best songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.

Amazon review: I don't like the sound of this or the band that sings it (although they're very good), but who cares? This is a solid, catchy little number that has the makings of a hit. This song is just a very catchy little number that has the makings of a hit. It's a very good song, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you've got a pulse.

Amazon review: This is a cool little album in which the bass player is the only one that isn't white. But the white guy sings and the white guy is a keyboard player and a drummer. He is not doing a good job at all. He does not sing well, but he does play the keyboard and the drums. He makes the keyboard part sound like it's in third position in a triplet. I can't believe he is a keyboarder. He is also white. I don't know why white people always have to be white, but white people are always white.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A bit of a novelty, but a great novelty. The guy is in a band called the Black Knights, and they play this strange, weird, little song with a lot of very strange, weird and even funny lyrics in which the guy is dressed up in what looks like an old, very ragged costume and he is singing about what he thinks is a woman in a nightgown. I thought it was funny. I like the song.

The first CD by The Black Knights.  I've been waiting for years to hear a band that was not white to make music.  These guys are a little bit different.  They are not your normal rock band.  They don't have a typical sound.  They play a little faster.  They don't sing the same way that other bands do.  This CD is a little different.  This CD is good.  This CD is a good CD.  This CD is a good CD.  This CD is good.  This CD is a good CD by The Black Knights.  I love this CD.  I love this CD.

Catchy tune.  This is a cool tune, but it's just a little to slow.  I don't know if it's the singer or the song.  I don't know why it's so slow.  I don't know if the song is too slow, but I like the song just a little bit.  I like the song just a little bit.  This is a good song that is just a bit to slow.  This is a good CD.  This is not a bad CD.

I really like this CD.  I like this CD.  I like this CD.  This is a really good CD that is a little bit to slow.
