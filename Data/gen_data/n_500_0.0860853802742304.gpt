Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I was looking for a good way to introduce a friend to the great music and culture that was going on in the 60s and 70s.  This just seemed like an interesting way to do it.  I've been looking for a good, non-pretentious way to introduce someone to the 50s - 60s period of my life, and this did it.  I was really impressed by the quality of the music, and the quality of the production was good - the two things you look for.  The only thing I might have added to the review is that I was surprised that there was no mention of the songs' original artists.  I'm not sure why that is.  I know that there was a real renaissance in 1960s music, but I had always seen this period in music as a period when there was a lot of great music but not a lot of great artists.  I think this book will appeal most to young people who want to enjoy great music from the 1950s - 60s, not just to relive the past.  I really enjoyed the book.  Overall a really good, good read.

Amazon review: This is one of the best books I have read about the Beatles.  I was amazed at how much the author knew about the events.  For example, he describes the car crash that killed Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney's broken leg, and Ringo Starr's broken ankle.  He even went as far as to research the car accident that killed John Lennon, and how the Beatles got to be the band they were.  I also really enjoyed how he described how the Beatles met.  For example, he describes how in the spring of 1964 John Lennon was writing down the lyrics to what he was going to do with the rest of the group, and then he goes on to describe Lennon recording the song, and then the song being played at a party.  I like how he describes the band meeting, and their first meeting.  It's very detailed.  In addition, he explains the songs that were recorded during the sessions, and the songs that didn't make the records.  And he also explains the songs that were left off the records.  One of my favorite chapters is about the songs that were left off the records because the band didn't have the money to record them.  This is really interesting.  When I finished reading this, I was amazed at how much I knew about the Beatles, and how much I didn't know.  I was amazed at how much there is still to learn.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This book is a great read about the Beatles.  You will learn that they were very popular when they were young, but they really began to show their genius in the early 60s.  You can learn about how they met, how they got their first recording contract, and really the history of the band.  This is an important book for those who want to learn about the Beatles.  It's also a good book for those who want to learn about the history of music in the 50s - 60s.  In addition, it's a great book for those who are curious about who the Beatles are, or want to learn more about the band.  There are a lot of interesting facts about the band, and some interesting facts about the recording studio.  I would definitely recommend this book.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I really like the instrumentals, especially the electric guitar playing.  And, the vocals seem to fit the subject matter.  I think it is a good album.

Amazon review:  This album is a must have for any country music fan.  Most country music can be classified into a few genres however, this album is by far the best.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

For the last three years, we've been using Amazon to order books for our family's Christmas books.  This year, we've had a few orders that were much smaller than usual.  They were all books for my son's school's book fair.  That's right, I said book fair.  I am a fan of the annual book fair.  It's an event that many schools don't get to have, but they should.  The book fair gives local schools the opportunity to showcase their books to their classmates, and to raise money for books in their schools.  My son's school gets a percentage of the sales for the books that are sold.  So, when we order books from Amazon, we always tell them we want the books for this book fair.  And always, we say, "for my son's book fair."  It's not like we're asking for the books to fill a void in our lives.  We're asking them to make our lives better.  I know I'm not the only one who thinks that.  Many of you do.  Amazon is a company that helps us be better people.  They are a company that helps us be better parents.  They are a company that helps us be better people who love books.

Sandy - Don't let the sun go down on me

"Don't let the sun go down on me, on the wrong side of the street"

I was really surprised by this song. It's very rare for me to find a song that makes me feel so good.

I'm listening to this song right now and am really enjoying every moment of it. The lyrics are great. And the vocals are amazing. I love when the singer is accompanied by a backing vocal that sounds like they're saying the same thing.

I had the pleasure of seeing Ed Sheeran live the other night and his voice really fits perfectly with this song.

That's my favorite song by Ed Sheeran. "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" is a great song. It's a great song to listen to when you need to be motivated and when you need to be happy. The song is a positive song and it can be very uplifting. When you listen to this song you can just feel the good feelings. When you listen to this song you feel good.

I love this song. This song really makes me feel good. It really makes me feel like I need to keep smiling and just go on and try to have a really good day. And when I feel that way I just have to put this song on and I just smile and I can't wait to get home. I just want to listen to this song for a really long time.

I love it when the lyrics are as positive and encouraging as this song is. It makes me feel so good.

I'm a positive person and this song really makes me feel that way.

Amazon review: So I am a big fan of Pearl Jam and I really like their songs and I really like their music, so I was excited when I got this for my birthday. Then I realized I had a lot of CDs I was no longer able to use! I was so mad because I wanted to listen to the Pearl Jam CD I bought for my birthday but I couldn't because I was too lazy to go take it out of the case and put it in my CD player! So I went out and bought a CD player then I realized that my CD player was no longer in the car!!! I was so mad because I needed it to listen to my Pearl Jam CD on my CD player, but because I was listening to it on my CD player I couldn't use my car- CD player so I walked to Target and got a new CD player and I was so happy! They were just as good as the CD player I had been listening to, so I went back to Target and bought another CD player, they were all good but the one I got from Target was better! I just wanted to listen to the Pearl Jam CD I was listening to in the car and I was so glad I went to Target! I'm looking for the other CD players, but I'm going to give these one more try. If you ever want to try these CD players out I would highly recommend them to you!

Amazon review: I was introduced to the music of Pearl Jam by my father, who was a fan of theirs. I discovered them by accident while listening to the music of my favorite band, AC/DC, on the radio. I was shocked that there was a band so similar to me, The Beatles, and I was absolutely shocked that they were also a British band. My father was so proud of me, and as I listened to them, I discovered that they made their music by using their voices and their instruments. Their music is very easy to understand. I now realize that I am just like them, and I am going to be just like them forever. The Beatles made their music by using their voices and their instruments. Pearl Jam is like my band, and I'm going to be like my band forever.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: If you like songs with meaning, then you'll like this.  But if you're looking for a song about love and heartbreak, forget it.  I don't get it.  The song is great, but the lyrics are just really bad.  I've listened to it a ton of times, and every time it's something else, like they're describing a certain state of mind or emotion.  The song is good, but the lyrics are just really bad.

Amazon review: I like the music, but the lyrics are just plain bad.  I mean, they're just bad.  I mean, the singer sounds like an amateur who just got off of a bad trip and is trying to impress everyone with his voice.  It's like a very bad impression of Johnny Cash.  I've heard this song three times now, and it's the same song over and over.  Every time I listen to it, it sounds like the same song.  They're not even trying.  They must have a really bad, messed up singer.  I'm sorry, but this is just plain bad.  I don't get it.  They sound like they're from outer space in a rock band.  The song is catchy, but the lyrics are just plain bad.  They are the worst songs I've ever heard.  And you should listen to this a lot.  The "collide" version sounds better, and is not nearly as cheesy.

Amazon review: I don't listen to music much, but I've been known to skip one song or another.  This is a song that I had to give a listen.  I don't understand all the hype.  The song is great. The lyrics are good, and the song is really catchy.  But why would I want to listen to something that I have to listen to multiple times over and over again?  Like, I've heard this song at least eight times now.  I don't know what that means.  It's just one of those songs that I have to keep listening to because it's stuck in my head.  The song is catchy, but the lyrics are just plain bad and unoriginal.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not really sure why I bought this.  Was it for the song, or just 'cause there's a picture of a naked woman on the CD cover?  I don't know.  I'm sure there's a story there, but I can't get into it.  The song is great.  The lyrics are okay, but the songwriting is kind of generic.  And just the general nature of the song just doesn't make me want to listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say, I like this song.  It's the first rock song that I've heard in a while, and it made me want to dance and sing along.  I don't know what it is about this song, but I really love it.  I don't necessarily think it's a bad song, just not my type of song.  I like the general vibe that it has.  The lyrics are okay, but I don't know why I would want to listen to something that's just going to remind me of the old songs I used to listen to when I was a little kid.  Maybe it's because I'm a little older now, but I don't think I'd like something like this.  Yeah, it's a cute song.  Not the best song, but pretty cute.

There's something about his music that I don't like.  I don't know why he gets so much hype.  He's not really a very good singer.  I don't know what songs he's going to do.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This is one of the most underrated albums of the late 50's and early 60's. The songs just don't get old, the vocals are great, and you can tell that the band is having a blast playing. You will not hear enough of this on any rock radio station.  There is a lot of great live music that I have yet to hear on any of the rock radio stations.  The only other time I have ever heard any of the Drifters live was at the St. Louis Civic Center, and that was years ago.

Amazon review: I have always loved this song because of the clean vocals that were so characteristic of the Drifters, and it is great to hear the song being sung without any distortion on record.  The song was released on the compilation album Only In America: The Drifters, which was released in 1985.  The song is one of the few I have listened to that I didn't find to be too long and boring, but it has a great feel and it is a great song to belt out on the dance floor.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of the classic Drifters, you owe it to yourself to buy this song.  I have listened to the song on the radio many, many times, and I have to admit I always loved it the first time I heard it.  One of my favorite Drifters songs, the version I've heard in the past was by Billy Gibbons, but I've also heard it by Jimmy Page, and I've also heard it by a couple other people I can't remember.  The version I've heard by Billy Gibbons on the radio always reminds me of the song and how great it was the first time I heard it.

This song is great, just like I thought it was when I first heard it.  It is a great song to belt out on the dance floor.  I think I am going to buy this song for my iPod.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

It's worse than "The Greatest Love Of All" by the Bee Gees, which was written for a man with a disability (which made it a lot worse).  The first song, "The Bee Gees Go To Hell" is about as bad as you could ever hope to do a song.  I'm not even kidding.  I have to force myself to listen to it in the first place.  That is the worst song I have ever heard in my entire life.  I don't care if it is a hit single.  I don't care if it is the #1 song in the world.  I wouldn't feel like it was a good song if I had to force myself to listen to it every day.  I don't even know if I would love it if I forced myself to listen to it every day.  It's garbage.  I wish I could tell you all that it had been done better.  I wish that I could tell you that they were just having a bad day, but I can't.  I can't tell you that for a fact.  I can just tell you that it is garbage.  It is garbage.  It is garbage!  It is garbage!  It is garbage!  It is garbage, garbage, garbage!  It is garbage, garbage, garbage!  It is trash!  It is garbage, garbage, garbage!  It is garbage!

Amazon review: I didn't like the Bee Gees album well enough to purchase the CD until I got a little older and I could look at my own record collection and find the album I wanted to own. I didn't like it enough to buy the CD until I saw the CD on eBay. It was the first album I ever bought on eBay.

Amazon review: A great rock-only song, but it doesn't have any rock element. This isn't the best of the Bee Gees.

Amazon review: I liked this song until I heard it on the Bee Gees' CD.  It is a really good song, but the Bee Gees are good at stuff like this.  It doesn't have much going on.

Amazon review: I like the Bee Gees.  They are one of the most popular bands of my generation.  I like all their songs.  It's hard to pick one song or album I dislike the most because I've heard them all.  I would love to see them return to the top of the Billboard charts with a new album.  I like them just as much as the next person.  I just wish they would stop playing those horrible songs.  The first song, "I Want to Hold Your Hand", is so bad it was played every day on American Bandstand, and it's still on the air.  The last song, "I've Gotta Get Back to Georgia", is even worse.  I'm not kidding.  I wish they would play other songs besides the ones they play on American Bandstand, the oldies stations, and the radio.  Every time I hear that song on an oldies station, I go, "What happened to the Bee Gees?"  I do not understand why they play

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: the worst try-hard band i've ever heard - how did these turds get an album out? oh YEAH - RICH PARENTS. ugh, lovely. it sucks, don't waste your money.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review:  I'm usually not a big fan of heavy metal, but I really like this band.  I love the lyrics on this one, it's almost a little bit of a love song.  I've never been this attached to a song before.  I'm going to be honest with you, I have to admit, there are some songs that I have to play in the background to drown out the noise.  It's not a bad thing that they're so good, but I'm hoping people come to realize that the music is not about the lyrics.  I think this song is a little bit of a guilty pleasure, I don't really like it all that much but it's not bad and it's not really that bad either.  The drummer can get very loud during the verses and I have to turn the volume down after the chorus, but the guitar parts are nice.  If you're not a fan of heavy metal, this song might not be for you.  But if you are, like me, it's a very listenable song.

Amazon review: This is a fun song, but I'm not sure if I'd call it a single.  I'm not in to the whole acoustic thing, but this time I'm into the acoustic.  I like the melody, the vocals, and the rhythm section.  It's well-made, but I don't think it's a single.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  The song starts off with the main riff, and the song gets a bit more rhythm and a bit more melody.  The vocals on this one are nice, but I really like the guitar, and the drums.  The sound quality is good, and they've got a good drummer.  If you like the acoustic, this acoustic is for you.

Amazon review: When I first saw this song, I didn't really like it at all, but then I went a little bit into the song and my love for it grew.  The vocals on this one are nice, but I don't know why I love this song so much.  The song starts out with the main riff, but it doesn't really get to the chorus until the second time through.  The vocals on this one are nice, but I don't love the guitar, but the drums are really nice.  The sound quality is good, and the drummer is really good and the guitar is nice.
