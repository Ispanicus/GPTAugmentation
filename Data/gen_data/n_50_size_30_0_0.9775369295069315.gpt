I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have purchased over 50 albums and I have never bought an album that I didn't like. I loved this album! It is a great album. I really loved the message of this album. I have always loved the message of this album. All of the songs were good. I wish I could have bought all the CDs but I had to wait for the CD to be released. I hope this review was right.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why this is the first one on the list.  Its one of the better ones I've listened to.  I am not a fan of punk or rock 'n roll, this song is like that, but with a slight change.  It has the most catchy beat, but the lyrics are pretty good.  I am glad that some people love it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not heard this song in a long time, and it still has the same impact on me.  I am surprised at how well it actually holds up.  This is the first song on the CD.  I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for an alternative to most of the other music floating around in today's mp3's.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Don't know if this song was played in the movie or not, but I do like it.  The guitar is pretty good, the drummer and sax player are decent, and the song is catchy.  It would be a great song to listen to when you need a pick me up.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Not all the songs on this CD are bad.  Some are good.  Even the ones I don't like I think are okay.  A few of the songs on this CD are great.  This one is one of them.  This song is an alternative to the typical boring popular music found on the radio, or the music you hear on commercial jingles.

Amazon review: I like this song.  I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this band or not, but I do like their music.  If you like this song I would definitely recommend it.  The band is fairly new.  Their music is not at all on the same level as other metal bands, but they are definitely a lot better then the average metal band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I did not know this band much before listening to this CD.  The first time I heard this track I knew I would like the tune.  I would not call this a real metal song, but it is definitely better then most metal songs I listen to.  The musicianship is good, but it is not metal.  I don't know why some people like this band.  The songs on this CD are all good, but this one is definitely one of the best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song.  I do not know why people are negative about this song.  This is one of the best songs I have ever listened to.  The lyrics are funny.  The song is catchy.  All the instruments are good.  The drumming and guitar are definitely better.  The song is not bad, just not very good.  I will give this a 4 out of 5.  I will say it does remind me of something I have heard before.  I cannot think of a name for the song.  It is in alphabetical order.  I think this song is a 5 out of 5.  (I think this is the band's best song.)
Sentiment: Not all the reviewers give the band a positive review, but this review has been the exception.  This review has been a great one for the band.

Amazon review: You should not listen to this song if you want to get better.  This song is one of the worst sounding songs I have ever heard in my life.  The music is terrible.  The beat is not in sync with the music.  The musicianship is terrible.  I have no idea what the song is about.  I do not like this song.  I will give it a 2 out of 5.  I think it is a 2 out of 5.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I first heard Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cante, I thought it would be an interesting take on the Latin feel of the song.  I have to say that this is not the case.  I was actually quite happy with the vocalist.  However, the rest of the cast was all terrible.  I thought they were going to do a great job.  It was like listening to a bad version of the original recording.  I am sorry, but I do not know what they were thinking.  The songs are too short.  They need a lot more instrumentation to be able to give this number any kind of impact.  The song is not all that bad, but I have to tell you that the voices are all horrible.  I would not listen to this one again.  I would not even pay attention to it.  I am not trying to insult the vocalist, but she has a voice that is not even close to being able to be heard over the instruments.  There are many other songs that have wonderful voices.  I do not know why we pay them so much money to try to make them sound better.  The instruments are very good.  They have to be to be able to do this kind of work.  It is not a bad song, but it is not a great one.  I am sorry I wasted my time listening to this.  I do not know if they are listening to you or not.  I will not buy any more of their records.  I will write them a letter and tell them that I have no respect for their talents.  I will not buy anything from them anymore.  I will send them a letter and tell them that I will not have anything to do with them anymore.  I will not buy anything from them anymore.

Amazon review: I have given up on Smooth Jax after hearing what they did to Thalia, I have given up on them.  I do not even know if they will try to release another CD.  They never release anything even worse than the last CD.  The songs are too short.  They need a lot more instruments to be able to give this number any kind of impact.  The songs are not all that bad, but I have to tell you that the voices of the vocalists are all horrible.  I would not listen to this one again.

Amazon review: This is a very good compilation CD, but I will not buy any more records from Smooth Jax.  What they did to Thalia is bad.  This has nothing to do with the instrumentation of the songs.  There are many other songs that have wonderful voices.  I like Thalia, so I will listen to her when I am listening to other artists.  I will not listen to this CD.

Amazon review: I give these records a big "F" for being a waste of time.  But it was something to listen to on the radio.  I like Thalia a lot, so I would not listen to this either.  I will write them a letter and tell them that I do not respect their talents and will not buy anything from them anymore.  I will send them a note on their web page and tell them that I will not have anything to do with them anymore and will not buy anything from them anymore.  Thanks for listening.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I purchased this cdr for my mom.  She loves this album and is always asking me to play it so I figure I should get her a copy.  I can't say she likes it as much as I do because it is a little repetitive.  It's an old-timey album.  I'm a little disappointed because this was the album I was looking forward to the most.  I just don't see why they don't put out new music more often.

###
Amazon review: All-in-all, this is a pretty good album.  It's not my favorite, but it's not a bad one either.  It's a bit like a cross between a lot of different artists that I really enjoy listening to.  I think it's one of those albums that will sound good to me in the car (or in my headphones), but won't sound as good with someone else's ears.  You don't always hear the best stuff in stereo.  The vocals are good, but the instrumental parts are a little dull.  The only real drawback is the instrumentals.  I'd rather listen to a live performance.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting album.  It has some great songs and some that are really great too.  It's a good mix of different types of music.  I don't know if it's better than AI, but it's definitely worth a listen.  It's a little older than AI, but I don't see why it shouldn't be.  I would recommend it to anyone who is into heavy metal, funk, and rap.  My least favorite tracks are "I Don't Care" and "What's Up Now."  They get a little repetitive.  I love "I Don't Care" and "What's Up Now."  I would have preferred to have gotten the original AI album, but this is a good album nonetheless.

Amazon review: I heard this CD and thought it was great, but it is not my favorite.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves heavy metal, or anything else.  It is a heavy metal album.  I don't like the vocals on this album.  It's very repetitive and there is no real "catchy" lyrics.  The rhythm is fine.  But, it is very boring.  I would recommend this album mostly to those who are into heavy metal.  I don't care for the lyrics.  I don't like the vocals.  The song "Punk Rocker" is a little repetitive.  It's the only song on the album that I didn't like.  I would recommend this to everyone.

Amazon review: I really enjoy the lyrics and the music of this album.   It is a very good album to listen to while driving or watching TV.  I wish it had more to it to make it a great album.

Amazon review: Twiztid really went back to their old "Twiztid" song.  It's a good song, but not up to their old standard.  The beats are nice, but I don't think their new songs have anything to offer that is worth the $20 price.  It's not bad, but it's not as good as the old songs that used to be on this album.  Maybe it is just my opinion, but I would like to hear it on a different album.  Just my opinion.  I'm not the biggest fan of their music, but I will definitely buy it if I hear it is released again.

Amazon review: TwizTid is a very good song. It's got a nice beat and it has a great hook to it. I do have some problems with the lyrics however.  TwizTid is not a good person.  He was not raised well.  His uncle killed his mom and he hates his uncle now.  I feel that is a little insensitive, but maybe that is just me. I have problems with the song, but I am not the biggest TwizTid fan but i will continue to listen to it regardless.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I just love Libera's music. I bought this CD because of its sound and lyrics, but for me the music is just not there. It's like he's trying to sing in a foreign language just so he can sound different. I would recommend this to very small groups, not to the general public!    I don't want to sound ungrateful, but this is really not one of the very best CDs I've heard in a long time!    The music is so loud that I can barely believe it when i listen to it, but I will continue to listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I purchased this for the choral music, and I am disappointed. The songs are so repetitive and monotone it is almost unlistenable. The worst part is, I bought this album because I thought it had something special to it. The only thing I can think of is that the sound quality is terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially teenagers.

Amazon review: I have been hearing this for about three years and I am still amazed at the beautiful sound of the boys.

Amazon review: I have read so many positive, glowing reviews on this album that I really wanted to add to the list. This album is for the music lover who wants to hear a real artist in the studio recording an album. The first thing that happens is the album starts out with an intro that I found to be a little too "happy" to be taken seriously. After that it gets a little bit of a change as the songs start to become more intense and the instrumentals are much more powerful. There are times where it is really hard to tell if the songs are actually performed or if they are just rap samples. I would have rated this album 1 star as I thought it would be a little more interesting from start to finish, but I can only give it 1 star. I would buy the clean version if it was a better version and a better album.  All in all a little more fun than expected, but not worth the money. I am not going to buy another album from the band.

Audio book is a way to kill time.  I tried the audio book on my iPad and it was great.  I don't think I'll be buying another audio book.  The audio book is not what I expected.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I will say that I like the album a lot when the vocals are not overpowering. The harmonies are very interesting. I have been to many concerts and many live shows. I've seen them live and on video. I like the Beatles and the music of the Beatles but I am not sure there is a better album than this one.

I like the Beatles, and the music of the Beatles, but I am not sure there is a better album than this one.

Another thing I like about it is that it is not a traditional song. When it is a traditional song, it takes up a lot of time. I like that it is not a traditional song, and that it takes up no time in my head. I like that it is not a traditional song. It is my favorite Beatles album!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
