Amazon review: I would like to give this a listen but I have to finish this book.  I have no problems to recommend this song to others.

A:

This is the original version from the film 'The Wizard of Oz'. It's not the version sung by Judy Garland. I'll see if I can find the lyrics.

A:

I'm not sure, but I think the original version is by "Judy Garland" and not "Swanee River", the song that Judy sings for Dorothy. The movie is called "The Wizard of Oz" and the song comes from the movie "Swanee River".

 
Here's a link to the song sheet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Zc9tP_jZ4

 

 

 

If you find any of these songs, please let me know :)

A:

Sounds to me like "Waltz Across the Plaza" by Louis Armstrong (aka "Lulu" or "Lulu Belle") from the movie "The Band Wagon".

 
Here's the link to the sheet music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F7K3p7vLX8

 
The lyrics are "You're the band wagon and I'm the band wagon, we'll waltz across the plaza, the band wagon, the band wagon, the band wagon, the band wagon, the wagon across the plaza, the band wagon, we'll waltz across the plaza, the wagon across the plaza, you're the band wagon and I'm the band wagon, we'll wag-a-wag across the plaza, the band wagon, the band wagon, the band 
wagon, the band wagon, we'll wag-a-wag across, the band wagon, the band wagon, the band wag-a-wag, we'll a-wag-a-walt across, the band wagon, the band wagon, the band wagon, the wag-a-wag, we'll a-wag a-wag across, the band wagon, the band wagon, the wagon across, the band wagon, the band wagon, we'll wag-a-wag"

 
I don't know if it's the same version as in the movie. A Google search was unsuccessful.

 

 
Here's the link to the sheet music: http://genius.com/o/o/o/o/o/o/i/i/o/o/o/o/o/i/o/o/o/o/i/o/o

 

 
A search for "Lulu" in YouTube did not yield this version.

 

 

 
The song is sung by Lulu, the girl who looks like Judy Garland. 

 

 

 

 
The music is by Louis Armstrong.

 

 

 

 

 
The lyrics are as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here is a link to the video of the song in the movie (the video is for the song "In the Mood"), not the song "Waltz Across the Plaza".

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
Here is a link to the video of the song in the movie "The Wizard of Oz" (the video is for the song "The Wizard of Oz").

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (Lulu's name is Judy Garland, but in the movie and elsewhere, Lulu is called Lulu Belle).

 

 

 

 

  (And in the movie, she is called Lulu Belle, but in the song sheet, she is called Lulu).

 

 

 
Here is the link to the sheet music.

 

 

 
The music is by Louis Armstrong. The lyrics are as follows:

 

 

 

 

I am afraid I don't know the name of the version that you're talking about.

 

 

 

 

 

 

  "Waltz Across the Plaza" is the original version, not the one sung by Judy Garland and not the one sung by Louis Armstrong.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was surprised that the songs were longer than normal, with the exception of the first song, which was 3:20. That is a very long song. I had to cut it off. The second song was very good. I actually liked it. I was happy that the songs were longer than normal. The guitar notes sounded like they were written by a band. I enjoyed them. I thought the music was very good and the lyrics were also very good. I loved the title song. The lyrics to it were very good. I wanted to like the rest of the album because of the title song. The cover was very cool. the song, however, was not cool. I'm a girl and I think it was inappropriate to listen to a song in my bedroom. I do not think the girl singing it should have to listen to it in her room. I do not know if that was her intent but I think it was inappropriate. I did not like how it was done. So, I took it as a sign that I was not ready for Jewel to tour again. I would have liked to have seen her perform live. Unfortunately, I will buy her cd's and listen to them.
Sentiment: Negative

I went to a Jewel concert with my mom and sister and I totally freaked out because I felt that she was trying to be so much to me. She sang the "I love you" song and she was telling me to take care of myself and to have a good life and that's all. She was pretty nice, I just didn't like the way she sang it. I thought it sounded really off. I really liked the song "When You Say You Love Me" and the rest of the songs. I thought that the songs were very good. I also liked the song "Little Green Men" because I thought it was funny.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The whole time I was listening to this, I was like "this is so good!" then it was like I was feeling a little uncomfortable so I started to skip to the end of the album, but then I realized that I was doing it to be polite and not to hurt the person who is singing, and I decided to turn the volume down when I was done. The songs are all very good, but there are a couple of times when they were just overplayed. The last songs are the best ones, and that would've been enough to be liked, but then all of a sudden Jewel is singing about how much she loves our species and how we're all one. It was very weird. Like she wanted to be so romantic. It's a little weird. I can't really comment on the lyrics because I don't really know what I am talking about. I guess I just don't like her singing style. I like her voice and I like her singing style, but I don't really like the song-writing of her. I didn't like any of the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album. I have never heard anything like it. I am a huge fan of The Eagles and Jewel's voice is just so powerful and commanding. When she sings the lyrics are just pure poetry. I can't wait to hear her sing more songs.

###
Amazon review: I liked the songs that were on here, but the ones that weren't were just painful to listen to. The first one, "Little Green Men", was just something that wasn't done very well. The song is a little more upbeat, but I think she should have included the bridge a little bit. She did however, have a blast singing it. The song "One Armed Man" is one of my favorite songs of all time, and I love the lyrics. It is a beautiful song. The song "Me Against Me" is also a great song. The song "Breakdown" is also a great song. I don't know. I was trying my best to like this album, but it just wasnt good. The song "One More Time" was great. I liked that song a lot. The song "Ain't No Sunshine" was my favorite.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I'm always a little skeptical of artists who have only been on the scene for less than a year.  I am not usually one to listen to bands who are only a year or so away from their debut album.

This album has very good lyrics, great harmonies, and a good rhythm section that backs it all up.  This album should not be overlooked.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Smooth Jazz Live @ the Ritz Theater, New York City (8/20/06)

This is a live recording from the Ritz Theater in New York City.  The Ritz is an intimate show venue with a capacity of just 250 people.

This is the second Smooth Jazz CD I have purchased from the band.  I have had problems with other Smooth Jazz CDs and have ended up having to return them.  This time it seems to be different.  I have listened to all the tracks and all are great.

The CD is titled The Ritz Sessions and was recorded over two nights.  The first night was on 8/19/06 and the second night was on 8/20/06.

This show was a "Rock" show and there were about 40 people in the audience.  The band is all in black leather jackets, white shirts, and red leather pants.  There was a small stage with two smaller tables and a large black table.

The first set started with "A Night in Paris" (a very popular song of the time).  The second set started with "S.C.O.R.E."  The crowd started out with "The Sweetest Sounds of the Sixties" and then moved to "The Man You Never Heard" with Bob Marley.  After that, the audience sang the chorus of "I Can't Stop Loving You" and then moved on to "The Lady Is a Tramp".

The first set then moved onto the next two songs, "The Long and Winding Road" and "The Man You Never Heard".  The second set then moved on to "All the Things You Are" and "The Lady Is a Tramp", and then "Don't Be Cruel" with the song "Don't Be Cruel".

The third set was a rock show and there was a lot of "crowd surfing" to get to the front.  The band played a lot of "great" songs.

The fourth set was an old school "rock" show with "Black & White Ball", "Black & White Blues", "The Man You Never Heard", "The Long and Winding Road", and "Don't Be Cruel".

The first set started off with "That's What Love Is, and Then It Was".  The second set started with "The Sweetest Sounds of the Sixties", then "The Man You Never Heard".  The third set was an older rock show with

Amazon review: No way, this is a terrible review. The album art is misleading. I thought the "soundtrack" was going to be all new material. I was wrong. As a matter of fact, it's nothing but a re-issue of the same material with different artwork. This album is no different than the "other" two albums in this series.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I liked most of my songs, but some I didn't.  I've got lots of CD's to listen to.  I found that the CD player at my church is broken, so I don't use it.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I wanted to see more of Meghan Trainor.  I liked "Love Me Right"  "Just Wana Be You"  "I'll Go Where I'm Belongs"  "God I'd Rather"  "You & Me" but did not like this CD.  I was disappointed with the songs I liked.  I don't know if I will buy another CD.  I'll probably just buy the CD and listen to the songs on it so I can decide.

He said it sounded nothing like Eastwood, but it sounded like something he would have made. I knew it was Eastwood's best work, and he was right. Very talented, but he can sing, but this is one of his strongest efforts. He is a born singer. You can hear it in his voice. I also love the vocals of the other artists on this album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

I think we all know what the best way to get someone to listen to your song is to let them listen to it themselves. It's what I do. If I don't like it, I don't listen to it. I don't listen to many songs that people love.

You may like it, you may not. It's your opinion. Just remember not to let it get in the way of what you want to do.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. It's just that I have to write about this song a lot. It's the only reason why I bother to write this blog.

I'll try to explain it as well as I can. This song is called "My Girl" by Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift is a pop singer from California. She started her career by being a backup singer for a popular music group called The Black Keys. She is one of the most popular pop singer from the 21st century. She is currently a member of the American pop band, The Black Eyed Peas.

The Black Eyed Peas are an American band. They started their career in 1996. They are also known as the musical group who formed a new genre called "electronica". Their first album was called "The Ides of March" and it was released in 1996. Their second album was called "The Seeker" and it was released in 1998. Their third album was called "The Jump" and it was released in 2000. Their fourth album was called "The Black Album" and it was released in 2002. Their fifth album was called "The Black and White Album" and it was released in 2005. Their sixth album was called "Unapologetically" and it was released in 2010. Their seventh album was called "Danger" and it was released in 2016. Their eighth album was called "The Black Album" and it was released in 2020. Their ninth album is called "The Black Album" and it is set to be released in 2021. Their tenth album is called "The Black Album" and it will be released in 2022. Their eleventh album will be called "The Black Album" and it will be released in 2023. Their twelfth album will be called "The Black Album" and it will be released next year. Their thirteenth album will be called "The Black Album" and it will be released the year after next.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I bought it at a very low price and have been very happy with it.  I just wish they could have recorded this cd with a studio.  When I played it at my house my husband says "I can't believe how good they are."  I never realized how good they were until I played it live and watched the band.  I have two songs from the cd on my iPod.  "You Have Been the Best Thing" and "I Know You Know."  I have had no problem getting them on other mp3 players.  I am glad I bought them.  I have the cd-sleeve cd to prove it.  I hope they come back and get back to the top.
