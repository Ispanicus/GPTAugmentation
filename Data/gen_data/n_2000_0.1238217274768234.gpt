Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a great song to play at your house.  You won't have any problems getting people to dance to this.  The song is upbeat and fun and will be a blast to dance to. (Just don't get on the dance floor too much or else you'll be the one dancing to the song not the song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This song is great, it plays better on a piano or guitar than a cello.  It is also good to listen to while you are doing something else, because it will change your mood.    The song is played at a faster pace than many other songs, but it also plays at a slower pace than many other songs.  It's definitely a good song to listen to when you are doing something else.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a great song.  It speaks of "The Man".  There is no such thing as a "Man".  There is a "Woman" and a "Woman" is a "Woman".  They are all different.  The song is about the life of a woman, so it is the song for that woman.  The music is great and the lyrics are very good.  The video clip is very good with a lot of music in the background.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  A song that will be played in the car, or on your way to work, or on your way to school.  The lyrics are very good.  The music is good.  The music video of the song is very good.  There are many different sounds of the song, and it is funny how it changes.  The song will make you laugh and is very good for the person that is in a good mood.    This song is always played at the end of a party.  It is good for the people who like to dance, and it is good for the people who like to have a good time.  It is always played in a club, but it can be played at any party.  This song is good for the person who likes to party.  It is good for the people who like to have a good time.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.

Amazon review: R Kelly by far has left the R&B wanta be's in the dark. R Kelly has produced hits for some of the biggest names in the musinc industry. To come out with a album that totally switches up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing. This album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really wants to hear ( MUSIC ).  Again, go Get IT!

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.

Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

Amazon review: I was looking for strictly Disney songs to be played by strings, no singing. The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs "Colors of the Wind", "A Whole New World" and "Beauty and the Beast" all had terrible singers singing along. I don't understand why it is "101 Strings Ochestra" and then singing for a few of the songs. It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental.

Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.

Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.

Amazon review:  Very nice, a very good recording, with excellent performances. Overall, I like the sound of "In Bloom" the best, and the best overall performance of all the songs on the album, so far.

Amazon review:  Wow.  This is really great.  The acoustic guitar playing on "All Apologies" is incredible.  "I'll Be Your Mirror" also has some great guitar work.  "Stoned" is really good, and "Breed" is great.  "Spank Thru" is my favorite song of all of Nirvana's.

Amazon review:  This album is a keeper.  The most important thing, which I think a lot of people don't realize, is that Kurt was a very private person.  He didn't want anyone to know who he was.  He didn't like the media.  He didn't want to be known.  He basically just didn't want to be.  Kurt didn't want any fame.  Kurt didn't want any attention.  Kurt didn't want any attention.  He didn't want any fame.  He didn't want any attention.

True, I've always liked Lucinda.  In a world of boy bands and shallow pop music she's been a constant factor, not always brilliant, but always heartfelt and sincere, providing a steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country, blues and rock.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

It is by far one of the best albums I have ever heard.  The music is soo deep and amazing with every song.  And the lyrics are soo deep and amazing.  And the music videos they put together for the songs are soo beautiful and awesome.  I have always loved the Killers music.  It is soo beautiful and awesome.  I have never heard them live but I read that they do a good job live.  I am totally in love with their music and their music videos.  I can not wait to see them live.  They are soo good.  I have always loved the Killers and they will always be my favorite band.  And I will always be in love with the music they put out.  Thanks for listening.  I will be back.

Hey Guys.
I'm sorry but it is too late to vote for the album I'm listening to.  I have been listening to the album for about 5 days now.  I have no idea what album it is but I am loving it.  I am a fan of the Killers.  I was born in 1988 so I am a little late to the game.  But I have been listening to them since I was 5 and I'm still a fan.  Now I am about to listen to their first album.  It is pretty good actually.  I have not listened to any of their other albums but I have been meaning to listen to them.  I have been listening to 'The Killers' for over 2 weeks now.  I am getting a little bored with the first song and I have already listened to the rest of the first song.  But I decided to listen to the second song first to see if it is any good.  The second song is 'The Edge of Glory'.  I can tell it is a good song.  It is very deep and deep voices and it really gets me.  I think it is one of their best songs to date.  I am not too sure about the rest of the album.  I am not a fan of the chorus yet but I am enjoying them so far.  The last song I am enjoying is the next one.  It is called 'The Killers'.  I think it is a good song.  It is very deep and deep voices.  I have been listening to this song for 6 days and I know it is a good song.  I think the song is very good.  I have listened to the other songs on the album for about 3 days now.  I love the music and I'm really enjoying it.  Their music is very good but I am not too sure about the rest of the album.  I really hope they make another album soon or they will become a true legend in the music industry.  I will be listening to them very often.  I love their music and I love their music videos.  I have a question for all of you guys.  I have been watching the videos on their official website.  I have always loved their music but I have always loved their music videos.  Their music video is called 'The Edge of Glory'.  How can I not watch this music video?  I am watching it constantly.  Is it because it is very deep and really gets me?  It is so deep I can not stop listening to it.  Anyway, I don't know if it is a good video or it is a bad video.  I don't know.  But it is a good video and it is very well done.  They have done so many videos and they are soo good.  I will be looking for more.  I love their music and I love their music videos.  But I don't know what to listen to.  I have been listening to them for 2 weeks now.  I really love the music and I'm really loving the music videos.  I have been watching the videos on the official website and I've been

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.

Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

##  Good Morning Sunshine

I'll be honest, I have always had a soft spot for the Beatles.

It's not that they were great at all, but that they were great in their own particular way.  They weren't the best guitar player in the world by any stretch of the imagination, they were great musicians.  They were great songwriters, they were great producers, they were great producers because they were good at production, but were good at production because they were great musicians.

The Beatles were great at making music, they were good at making music because they were great at making music.  That's my opinion at least.  I have always loved the Beatles, and to be honest with you, I have always loved the Beatles because they gave us that single that opened the doors for other music.  They made us believe that music can be something more than just something you put on the radio, that music can be something that actually changes people's lives.

The Beatles were a great example of how music can be like that, they were great because they were great at the music, but they were great because they were great at the music because they were great at making music.  When the Beatles made a great song, they made it great because they made it great because they made it great because they made it great.  I don't care what other people say, and I don't care what other people think, the Beatles made a great song because they made a great song because they made a great song because they made a wonderful song.

Lets be real, the Beatles were great, but they weren't the greatest in the world.  They weren't the greatest guitar players, they weren't the greatest songwriters, they weren't the greatest producers, they weren't the greatest, they weren't the greatest because they weren't the greatest.  They were great because they were great.

I believe in the Beatles, I believe in the Beatles because they made a great song because they made a great song because they put a lot of heart and soul into making a great song because they put a lot of heart and soul into making music.  They were great because they were great.

That's a simple message for you guys, and I hope you can understand what I am saying.  And if you don't understand, I hope you will at least understand that I'm saying the Beatles were great because they were great, and I hope you will understand that I am not saying the Beatles were great because all the Beatles were great.  I am saying the Beatles were great because they were great.

And if you like the Beatles, and if you like the Beatles because they made a great song because they made a great song, then remember this.  The Beatles had a great song, they had a great song because they were great at making a great song because they were great at making music.

Now the Beatles were great because they were great at the music, but they were great at the music because they were great at making music.

That's the message.  I hope you guys understand it because if you don't, it's a simple message.  I hope you guys can understand it.  I hope you guys can really understand it because if you do understand it, then you know it's a simple message.  It's a simple message, a simple message for you guys, and I hope you guys can understand it because it's not complicated, and you guys can really understand it because it's a simple message.

The Beatles were great because they were great at the music but they were great at the music because they were great at making music, and the Beatles were great because they were great at making music because they were great at making music.

Now that is a simple message for you guys, and I am hoping you guys can understand it.

I hope you guys enjoy the music.  I hope you guys enjoy the music because I hope you guys enjoy the music because I hope you guys enjoy the song because I hope you guys enjoy the song because I hope you guys enjoy it because I hope you guys enjoy it because it's a good song.

It's a good song because the Beatles were great at the music but they were great at the music because they made music.  And the Beatles were great because they made music because they made music because they made music.  The Beatles were great because they were great at the music because they were great at the music because they were great at the music.  The Beatles were great because they were great at the music, but they were also great at the music because they were great at making music.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.  The shift in focus from shredding to melody, long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing.  While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review:  I'm always a little curious about new stuff I hear in the radio, and this is no exception.  The first thing I noticed is that they changed the song to not be a parody of the movie and instead to be a song about a person in love.  I love that they did this, because it's a very subtle and clever change.  Also, I love that they put the lyric "I'm always a little curious" in bold.  I love it and think it's one of my favorites from the album.  It's a little different in sound than the other songs on this album, but it's still pretty good.  It's a great addition to the album, and I definitely recommend it.

I would LOVE to hear more of his material, but this is just so disjointed and I don't understand how this man gets a fair chance to say anything new.  I'm not trying to be negative, but these are the worst tracks on the CD, and I do wish he would get on the radio somewhere.  This is just so disappointing.  The album is supposed to be a tribute to Royce, and instead, he is just using his material to say the same thing that Royce said. I'm not bashing Royce or Crooked I, but there should be something new to the fans of Royce & Crooked I. Not just the same.  This is just stupid.  The original Royce was a great lyricist.  He could write a song about anything!

Amazon review: There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has been a lot of the news lately, and not for her music. It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split. But for her latest single, she wants to try and recapture whom she was a singer before, and fails to do it on Papi, the third single from her album Love? The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I like the music on this album, but the video is not as good as the song.  I do like the song, but don't like the video at all.

Amazon review: If any of you have seen the movie "The Aviator", you know what a great song this is.  The song is about the love of a man and a woman who both want to be with someone else. The video is not very good, but I think it is better that the song.  I like the song, but the song is better.

Amazon review: The album is great.  The first song is a fast song called "The First Song" that is very good.  The second song is "My Heart Would Break" and is very good too.  "Papi" is the best song on the album and is also very good.  I must have got this album by mistake and the song is great.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes great musicals.

Amazon review: The only complaint I have with the album is that it is not as good as the first two.   I would recommend this album to anyone who likes great music, but not those who like to hear their own voice singing.

Amazon review: This is the best album of the year.  It is not the best of the year, but it is the best of the year.  A lot of good songs on this album.  I really like the song "My Heart Would Break", it is very well written and I really like the chorus of the song, but the lyrics are not that good.  "Papi" is the best song of the album, but the song is not as fast as the first two songs on the album.  The last song is "The First Song" and is very good.  I like the song, but I do not like the video because it is not very good.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes great music.  I do not like the name of the album, but I like the name of the album.  The album is good.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes great music, and the lyrics are very good.

Amazon review: This is a horrible arrangement.  Mr. Hecocks begins with a bizarre cowboy theme on all black keys that a piano student would learn on his first lesson.  This theme is repeated during the recording.  What does a cowboy theme have to do with a worship song.  Strange.

Amazon review:   My little sister and I love this song.  We bought it as Christmas presents.  We listened to it for about an hour.  Then we sat back and watched the big Christmas movie on tv.  We bought the DVD and put it in the front seat.  We went out and played the CD in the car.  Then we both went to sleep.  We listened to the CD last night when we got home.  It's a good song.  It's just not a huge hit.  It's ok.  I'm not really sure what I'm missing.  I'll stick with my little sister's copy.

Amazon review: I like this song.  It's good.  I don't listen to R&B a lot, but I like this song.  I like that it's a worship song.  I liked the message of this song.  I'm not sure what I thought I heard when I listened to it and it's not clear.  I like the music and I like the lyrics and the message.  For the most part, I like the message of this song.  I don't like that it's a worship song.  I don't like it's lyrics.  My boyfriend really liked this song and he was really disappointed that it was a worship song.  He loved the message of the song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I like this song.  I liked the message in the song.  I didn't like the lyrics.  This is a song that is sung in a loud voice in a religious setting of some kind.  I don't know what I heard and I don't know what I thought I heard when I listened to it, so I don't know if I can rate it any higher.  I listened to it a lot when I was growing up and I liked it.  I'm trying to listen to it in my car, but I don't know what I heard and I don't know what I heard when I listened to it, so I don't know if it deserves any better.  I'll listen to it again.  I liked the message of this song.  I don't know what I thought I heard when I listened to it and it's not certain.  I like the music and the message in the song.  I didn't like the lyrics.

Amazon review: This album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the 70's and 80's. While I think that Maynard Ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation, Woody brought a pretty decent band along as well, even though he was entering the last decade of his life. Amazing guy, amazing version of La Fiesta. Starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time (were they all Rolands?) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from Woody, there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle: shrieking trumpets, a nifty Tiberi solo, and awesome dynamics.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

I don't know why I'm not going to this show.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of both the old and new music of the band and this is a good mix of both.  First it's a good mix of old and new music.  Second it's good for a new band to get their name out there.  Third it's good for their new album to show that they're different, better, more original, etc.  Fourth it is a good listen to hear if you're a fan of the new music or if you haven't heard them.  Fifth it's good for you not to care about the new music or not to care about the new band.  Sixth it's good to have a new band with a new name and a new album.  The only negative thing about this album is that it doesn't have a good vocal.  I like this band but they didn't have a good vocal on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album is the best thing I've ever heard from the band.  Their new album is one of the best things I've ever heard.  I love the energy the band puts out.  I don't know why I don't have this album.  I'll be here when it comes out.  It is a great album.  The only negative thing is that I don't like the vocals on this album.  It's a great album but I don't like the vocals.  They are weak.

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside. It's got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time.  Aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 lines of lyrics with no substance, they "borrow" the can-can song and make it even more irritating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was pleased with the CD and the booklet.  With all the info I needed, I was able to get everything I wanted in the CD.  However, the booklet is a bit small and I would have preferred the CD to come with a cover.  The booklet is not designed to be taken out of the CD case, but rather the booklet is made to be put back in the CD case with the CD, it's not very convenient for the CD to be put away in the CD case.

Amazon review: I don't like this CD, I just do not like all the songs on it.  I hate the fact that they are completely missing from the CD.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: I've been a Dylan fan from way back.  And, I'm also a big Sinatra fan.  I write this review from that perspective.  What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review:  This was the first album I've ever bought.  It was a little overpriced for what it was, but I will say I'm glad I went out and got it.  I'm a big fan of The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Cars, so I thought this would be a great buy.  I was wrong.  This album is a rip-off of the Beatles, Cars, etc.  The production is terrible, but the songs are great, but when you listen to them, you can tell that the band was very inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing.

Amazon review:  I think that this CD is the first time I've ever heard anything by The Beatles and it's a great album.

I really like this CD and I'd highly recommend it.

Amazon review:  I love this album.  It doesn't really sound like the Beatles, but the songs are great.  I had this CD in my car for a week before I put it in the stereo.  I listened to it every day when I was driving and listening to the radio.  I'm not sure, but the songs sound to me like they were recorded at different times and that's why they sound different.  I only got a couple of songs out of the whole album, but the ones I did get were great.  I'd highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes pop music.

Amazon review:  This album is very good, but it sounds like a remix of The Beatles.  The vocals are nice, but the harmonies are so bad that they are not even close.  The only good songs on this album are the originals.  There are very annoying songs on this album, like "I Don't Wanna Go Home" and "The Ballad Of A Thin Man".  These are the only good songs on this album.

Amazon review:  This album is a fun album.  It's made by a band from the 90's, and they played this album in the 90's.  It's a fun album, but it's not very good.  I don't like this album a lot.  I like the Beatles, but The Edge is a bad singer (I think), John Lennon's voice is terrible, and Paul is so loud.  The band sounds like a band that would play at a place called "The Bongo Room"

Amazon review:  This is my first time hearing this album, but I'm going to give it 5 stars because it's a "hit" and the band that made it is one of my favorites.  The album has a lot of great songs, but it's very hard to find your favorite song on the album "It's A Miracle" because there's way too many different songs that sound alike.  I can't find my favorite song on this album, so I'll give it a 5.5.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: Uninspired garbage.  Such a disappointment. I have been with Manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out.  I couldn't be more unhappy. Uninspired is the best way to describe it.  It seems so half-assed when compared to their previous albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a good album as far as I am concerned. I have been a Manowar fan since the first album and have heard all of their albums.  I can say that this is their best to date.  They are the kind of band that is worth the money and would be something you would get to know more about.  You get the feeling that they are a very hard working band and that they are just trying to make a good album.  It is a good album with a good message.  They are the type of band that I would want to play at a concert and I would want to see them again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I purchased a copy of this album just to find out the truth. The Manowar's first album was one of the best albums ever and I really enjoyed the whole concept. This album is nothing like that. To me this album has been a total disappointment and I cannot believe that people are still buying this album. I own every Manowar album and have been a fan of them since the first album. I will not be buying their next album. This album is just a joke and a waste of money. They should have just left it alone and put out the first album.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is my favorite album from Natalie.  A collection of great songs, but the lyrics are too generic.  They are not unique or specific to the singer herself.  If you are looking for a Natalie album that is completely different then this is not it.  The songs are great, but the lyrics are generic.

Amazon review: This is a classic (or at least one of the best) Natalie songs. I love it because it's a great song, and it's a great album.  It's just so sad.  It's so sad that the last time I saw Natalie was at her show in Houston, and I wish she had a good tour going.  It's a little sad that the last time I saw her was at the Houston concert.  It's sad she is no longer with us, and it's sad she couldn't come to the show.  All I can say is that this song is amazing.

I hope she finds her way back to the music industry.  It's sad that she was not able to come to the Houston show and I wish she was able to come.  It's also sad she has gone through so much and hasn't been able to come to the Houston show.
