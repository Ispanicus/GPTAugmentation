Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Bought CD, but not version of song I wanted.  Rest of CD was not good.  Returned was refused.  Now what?

Amazon review: Not the best album around, but not for the faint of heart.  I'm not a huge fan of this style of music and I don't like to be sold something I don't want.  I do have to say that the band is great, but this is just the sound of a band that's got no money and no respect.  They are a bunch of losers who don't even have a decent guitar player or drummer.  You have to respect it and give them some credit for trying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not what I expected.  I thought this was a hip hop album but this is not rap at all.  I think it is just a cover band recording, but I can't find out for sure.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This band is just too loud and just over the top that it is over the top.  Their vocals are too loud and they are too over the top that they just get in the way of the music.  I had to turn this off.  If this band is on they need to be quieter.  This is a band you can listen to when you want to listen to a band that is all good.  Not when this band is on.  Good for you if you like bands that are loud.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this band, but they are not as good as I expected.  I expected a more rock/alternative style of music, but maybe that is just me being picky.  I think this is one of the worst records I have ever heard.  The guitar is sloppy, there is no melody, the vocals are too loud, the drummer is too loud, and the bass is way too loud.  I don't think I will ever buy another album from this band.  They are a joke.  This band is so unoriginal and is just a bunch of loud, sloppy pop music.  I don't think I will ever buy another one of their records.  There is nothing original, and they are just not good enough to be on a "best of" list.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This band didn't take it past the 1/3 song mark.  I don't know if they are trying to get me to buy their other albums, or just trying to get people off their music.  This band is too loud and there are some times where people can't understand what they are saying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are kinda funny and funny, but the instrumentals are too loud and a little to fast.  The vocals are too loud and a little too fast.  The music is too loud and a little too fast and not right for a rock music band.  I don't know if I will ever buy another of their albums.  I don't like songs that are too fast.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums, but it is a little boring.  There are some good songs on this album, but there are too many mediocre songs and it is just too long.  I don't like the way that they mixed the songs together.  The vocals are too loud and the music is too loud.  I would like to hear more songs here, but I just don't want to hear any more of this album.  I think that it is too long, and you don't have the time to listen to the whole album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've always enjoyed his music. When I first started listening to Christian music, I tried to be a little more "intelligent" about what I would listen to. I would listen to a bunch of different Christian music, and then decide. I eventually narrowed my selection down to 2 or 3 Christian artists, and I would listen to the music of each individually. Eventually, I began to buy albums by each artist. The first album I bought was by Dallas Holm. Over the next couple of years, I began to get into other Christian artists who were a little more "intelligent." It took me years to find an album that I was really fond of by a Christian artist. It was Dallas Holm's "The Crossroads." That album was the first one I really began to listen to. I would buy it and then not listen to it for a few years. It was then that I discovered his album "Til He Comes." That album took things up a notch. His album "To the Crossroads" was the second one I really began to listen to. I would buy that album and then not listen to it for a few years. That is when I discovered his album "The Crossroads." That album took things up a notch. I purchased his album "To the Crossroads" on a whim. After listening to it a couple of times, I decided it was time to purchase the rest of his CDs. Over the years, I have listened to almost every CD issued by Dallas Holm. The CD that I purchased today is his "The Crossroads." I just can't get it to play on my MP3 player. It was supposed to come out this week, but it was delayed. In the meantime, I have purchased the CD "To the Crossroads." It's not as good as the first two CDs, but it's still very good. I purchased that CD on a whim. I thought I would add it to my collection. I like to buy albums on a whim, and I like to be surprised. I have purchased "The Crossroads" so that I would be able to listen to it more often. I'm very pleased with it. It's a great album. I really enjoyed listening to it. It's been a long time since I've listened to Christian music. The last album I purchased was by Dallas Holm. I've been listening to Christian music for a couple of years now. I started with "Til He Comes" and then moved on to the rest of his CDs. The CD

Amazon review:  I had to get this album.  I was searching for a new rap album to pick up without any luck.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  The lyrics are very good with good flow.  The beats are dope and the sound quality is great.  The only problem is that the beats are not tight, there is an out of tune sound, some of the songs are not consistent.  Some of the beats are not even close to being right and some of the verses are just too long and they should be cut in half.  That would make this a 7.1/10.  But besides the problem with the beats the songs on this album are good with the exception of the choruses and the Madrox tracks which I thought were very bad.  Overall the album is good, there are some bad songs on it which makes it a 7/10.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I'm not sure what I'm going to replace the CD with.  I'm not sure why the cd is no longer available.  I don't think I'm going to buy another.  It sounds like a used CD.  I don't know.

I've heard a lot of people comment on how the songs are so over the top for the time and place they were written.  And they are.  But that is what makes them so entertaining.  The first time I heard this cd I was like, "What the hell is this  music?"  As I listen to the songs I realize that I have been listening to music for over 50 years.  This is my first time listening to this cd.  I like the lyrics and the music.  Some of the songs are better than others.  Overall, I like this cd and will probably buy it again.  It's very good.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

The voices are excellent with a range that goes from high to low register.    I have a personal favorite and that has to be "The Windmill" with its beautiful and unique arrangement.

When I heard his first album on a cassette it was the first time I heard a real, clean, "album version" of a song.  He was totally different then, and it made me want to hear more.    This second album is the best he's made to date.    It's a great album and it's a great representation of how a real artist should be treated.    The harmonies are excellent.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought the clean version by mistake. I would never buy a clean version Eminem album. So make sure it is what you're looking for
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think the first few times I heard this album I was bored of Eminem and thought "what the hell am I listening to Eminem for? what's going on?"  Then I realized it's not all about him, it's about the lyrics, and how the songwriting changes by the time they get to the chorus.  This album is worth every dollar.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I find it amazing that people are still talking about this album.  It's the first album I have ever bought for myself and I am so glad I did.  It is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  I don't care what anyone says I still think this album is the best out of all Eminem albums.  It is a masterpiece.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's so easy to get caught up in the fact that Eminem has become a huge artist but this album shows he has the artistic skills to be an even bigger.  This album is great.  If you are a big fan of Eminem, then this album is definitely worth checking out.  If you're not a big fan, I'm not sure why you would even consider listening to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A good album.  I wish I had listened to this album earlier.  I bought it at a bargain price but it was still worth it.  The songwriting is amazing.  But I have come to realize that Eminem is not a great songwriter.  His best songs just don't work.  His lyrics are good but it's the wrong songs that make his albums great.  I don't think the lyrics are as bad as some people say.  I think that the songs that people say are bad are just that.  They're not as good as the rest and are better left where they are.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the greatest albums ever.  It's so good it's hard to believe it isn't a masterpiece.  You know what's great?  The fact that it's not a masterpiece.  I don't care what anyone says, I just can't fathom someone saying this album is a masterpiece.  The lyrics are great, but not great enough to be a masterpiece.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Some people criticize Eminem for being derivative of other artists but I think he has the talent to make an original work.  This album is very original and should be listened to by everyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the definition of an ear-worm.  Every time I listen to it, I think of something cool to say and then I say something cool.  I think this is Eminem's best album yet.  This album is like a high score on a video game.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album but I can't.  It's so bad it's good.  It's like listening to a bad movie.  I want to like it but I can't.  I can't listen to this album without getting angry about it.  The lyrics are terrible and the music is bad.  I don't know what else to say about this album except that it's so bad that good music is out there.  This is Eminem's best album and he doesn't even deserve it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is so bad it is good.  It is hard to believe that this album is so bad.  The lyrics are bad but you would think it is a great album if you listen to this album.  The music is awesome.  It is a really great album that you just can't listen to without getting angry at the lyrics and the music.  I still don't know why I bought it.  I guess I'm just really bored of the last Eminem album.  I wonder if he'll ever record a decent album.  I hope he does.  I hope he does it soon.  I hope he does it by the time he is 70.  I hope he does it a better album than this one but I don't think he does.  I don't like this album.  I like this album better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this album all the way through twice.  It's amazing how when you listen to anything over and over you get sick of it.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it after hearing it the first time.  It is a good record but I think it is a good record that is just really really slow.  There is a lot of nothing in there.  It is kind of boring.  I don't think you can listen to an album

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I have been hearing about this new girl group called Meghan Trainor.  I really love, love, love her music.  I was very much hoping to see this new group.  I really like the music, the video, and the lyrics. I really hope they make a more powerful song than the one of the group I've heard.  I like how it's different.  I hope to hear a song like this from Meghan.  I hope that the members are different from the girl group I've heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I can say the first thing I remember about Meghan Trainor is her single, "Good."  I remember wanting to hear more of her music. The other songs are different but I would still feel like I'm listening to the same song.  As for the video, I feel like it's very beautiful.  I love the style.  I also love the song and I'm really excited to see more of this artist.  I'm glad I found this CD when I did.  I really love the lyrics and the way they connect to my feelings.  I always thought that "Good" was the best song Meghan had released.  I'm glad I am getting a chance to listen to the other songs on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this CD!  This music is amazing and it makes me feel like I'm not alone.  I love how she has a message about love, peace, acceptance, and happiness.  This is a beautiful and touching album.  It's not just a pretty face.  I love the message, the music, and the lyrics.  I'm glad I found this CD.  I loved it when I first heard it.  I love the song, the video, and the lyrics.  I'm glad I found this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I absolutely love Meghan Trainor's music!  I love how the lyrics connect to my feelings.  I can't get enough of this artist.  This girl is really talented.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is very different from Meghan's other CD.  This is not a good CD.  I don't want to say it's a bad CD, but it's a very different CD.  It's not like me, but this CD doesn't satisfy me.  This is not a good CD

Amazon review: This song has nothing to do with the movie.  I wish it would have been more relevant.  I would have bought this song for the purpose of being able to listen to it while I'm watching a movie on my phone.  This song is an over exaggeration of the movie's message.  I would have bought this song if it was connected to the movie in some way.  I'm not a fan of over exaggeration, and this was not.  I could have easily bought this song without the movie.  I have no idea why this song is in my library.

Amazon review: This is a song with a high pitch with a really annoying sound to it.  It sounds like a guy who has a really low voice.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I have listened to several versions of this song but this is the only one that I have ever felt connected to.  It is also the only one that I have ever heard that I haven't turned off the music.  I have turned off many other songs, but not this song.  I have been listening to this song for nearly two years now, and it still speaks to me.  If you are a music lover, you will love this song.  This song will bring a tear to your eye, and a tear to your soul.  I have never heard a song that moved me like this.  This is the best song of his that I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This band is terrible.  The other day I was listening to a little old song that they did live with the original members.  It is a good song; I just don't think they are anything else.  I have never heard a band with such mediocre songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this band on the internet many years ago.  If you are an old school fan of the 50's or 60's, you will love this band.  They are the reason I know about the music of the 50's and 60's.  They play a great mix of rock, country, and jazz.  As for the band itself, I have to say that I have been disappointed with their recordings.  The sound is pretty poor and the songs don't have the energy and drive of their live shows.  The sound suffers whenever they play a song that has a high energy backing or fast tempo.  The sound changes on each song you listen to.  They do have good songs on their CDs, but it doesn't sound like the songs on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This band just isn't good at all.  The lead singer is really annoying and the rest of the band isn't really good either.  I can't believe that I went out and bought this CD to hear them.  The CD is great, but the band is so-so.  The band is so-so because the lead singer is so annoying and the rest of the band is so-so because they haven't put in any energy or effort into their songs.  They have had their songs on the radio for a while now and they continue to play the same old songs.  They play their songs off of records that they have already bought and I just don't know why they think that is a good idea.  The drummer is really annoying too, but he is a good drummer and the bass player is a good bass player.  There are several other people playing bass as well.  They are not good at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of this group for many years.  They have been on the radio with their songs for a long time.  Their CDs are good.  This is my first time buying a CD from them.  As for the band itself, I like them.  I just don't like the sound of their music.  I don't know why, because I have never heard anything by them before.  The songs are all very upbeat and have a "feel good"  feel to them.  I like the sound of the music and the songs, but I don't think  they are any good at all.  They are not bad, but I don't think they are any good, either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my first CD purchase by an artist.  I am an old school fan of the 50's and 60's, and I have bought all of their albums.  I have bought their CDs to listen to and I liked them all. I have been impressed with the sound of the band and the music.  This CD is also good, but I am disappointed with the sound of the music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I enjoy the sound of live music more than most other types of music.  I can't imagine why CD's were made with sound.  They were made with sound so the CD players would play the music.  I didn't buy this CD because I liked the sound of the music.  I bought it because I bought other CDs by the same artist and liked them.  I don't think this CD is worth buying either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just bought this CD.  I bought the CD because I enjoyed it when I heard it on the radio.  I liked the sound of it.  I didn't know the artist.  I don't know why I bought it.

I don't like CDs.  I don't even like listening to music.  I would rather listen to the radio.  I only like songs by artists that I like.  I don't know why I bought it.  I really don't know.  I don't even like CDs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not the biggest fan of Jewel. I do like her voice, but she is too much of a "pop singer" not to be a hollywood singer. Her singing is not the best, but she is a singer. She should have just left that career and been a teacher. I would have enjoyed her more. Her singing is good, but her singing is not best.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the album. It does have some songs I don't like. I don't like them all and I'm sure many others don't either. However, I do like most of the songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: The CD is a good value.  The first four tracks are not awful, but it all comes down to the last track, “Can’t Stop,” which is just a complete mess. I’m not a huge fan of “I Don’t Wanna Lose,” but I’m not a huge fan of the rest of the album either.  I'm not sure what happened but I just can’t listen to it anymore.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I bought the CD so I could listen to the amazing music of this magnificent man and his wonderful wife, Iman.  I have not played this album in over a decade and I have never played it better.  It is a must-have.  I am sure that Iman will not be happy if I tell her that I have bought this CD.  My love of the music of David Bowie is the reason I bought this album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love this band, I love what they do, and I love the music, I love the songs and I love the album, but I am not crazy about the way they went about the recording. They tried to make songs so they didn't sound like the songs but like the songs. I mean, you want people to listen to the songs they heard on the radio, but you also want them to listen to the songs that came out of their heads. The result is a bunch of songs that sound exactly alike.

Amazon review: The first thing I noticed about this album was that it had a lot of songs that were almost identical to each other. This is to be expected, because their albums usually have a lot of songs that have the same type of subject matter. The songs on this album are great, and the lyrics are decent. I would recommend this album to anyone. It is a great listen, and you can tell that these guys care. I also recommend this band, but not as much.

Amazon review: I love this band. I really do. They are on a lot of my favorite albums. I even just listened to a song off their latest album, and it sounds like they are playing their music off a cassette tape. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are catchy, and the music is catchy. There is not a bad song on this CD, which makes me think that they are just playing their music off a cassette tape. They have songs that play like the songs on their albums. All of their songs are great. I don't remember how old I am, but I remember that after I heard the song "Stuck in the Middle", the song was stuck in my head for days. I guess that means I am an old timer. I also liked the song "Take It from Me", which made it onto the album. My favorite songs are the two songs that are on here, "Don't Give Up on Me" and "My Funny Valentine". I also like the song "I'm Not Crazy". I think all of the songs are great and all of the lyrics are good. The only thing I don't like about this CD is that the artist's names are all on there. I really do think that this is a great CD. I have recommended this CD to a lot of people, and I think that it is the best of the four CDs that they have released so far.
