Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I never realized how much I was missing from the Al show until I got to this song.  The first half is pretty good.  It's the second half that's been completely ruined by a poor bass line and a terrible guitar solo.  The second half is just a horrible mess.  Why bother with the song at all?  It's just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I didn't think he could go any lower with his lyrics.  But he takes it to the next level.  This is one of the best lyrics of the year.  It's just a shame that the music is completely awful.

Amazon review:  I don't think he's ever had a bad song.  But what a mess!  It's like he's trying to write a song with three chords.  But they're all wrong!  And it's all off key.  It's like he's trying to write a song with three chords and then he ends up with seven chords.  It's like a mess!

Amazon review: The band is great, the song is great, the vocals are great, but the instruments (bass, drum and guitar) are a big let down.  I guess everyone else has a great album to compare it to, but I didn't think this had any comparison to it.  It's just a really bad album.

Amazon review: I think this is the worst thing he's ever done.  The music is average, the lyrics are terrible, and the bass is just as bad.  The band is a great band and I think they're at their best live.  But the instruments just don't work for this kind of music.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: A very interesting approach to country music.  I like some of the songs on this album, but I do have to give it a few minor comments.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Not a good album at all, unless you are a fan of the original.  (I am not.)  I know I had the wrong album.  I got the "Hollywood" album as a result of a friend's recommendation.  I am a fan of the original, but not that fan.  I will say it is a nice arrangement and does have a decent chorus but it is a bit of a disappointment.

Amazon review: My wife and I were looking for a good mix of "In The Bleak Midwinter" and found this album.  It was advertised as 'In The Bleak Midwinter (Album Mix)' so we thought this is what it was.  When we were listening to it we couldn't help to notice that it did not have the same arrangement as the original.  The arrangement was very odd.  The song was a great one.  It was a little hard to listen to at first but after a couple of takes, it began to grow on me and I became a fan of the song.  What I didn't know was that this album was also advertised as 'The Divine Office (Album Mix)'  So when my wife and I went to purchase it, we thought this was what it was.  After a couple of takes we were not happy with how it was playing and we thought this was the album we should buy.  When we listened to it we discovered it was not the same as the original.  It was very difficult to listen to and it didn't take long before I started to like it.  When my wife and I listen to it as a duo we both enjoy it very much.

The problem is that I have no idea how to publish a CD on CD and I have no idea how to do that. I have spent my life playing for people. I want to give back something to the world. I hope I can do something to help people enjoy music. If only I could find a way to put the songs on CD.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never heard of this group.  I am wondering what genre they are in, because this group is really hard to decipher. There are many mixes of these songs.  So many different mixes!  This is music for people who love hip hop and the genre in general. I have heard that the group has changed the genre a bit.  I don't know, it seems like the same song repeated over and over again. That's not the case on this album. This is just a compilation of different hip hop artists that I really can't tell.  It's a mixed bag.  I would recommend this for people who love hip hop. I don't think this is the type of music that you hear on the radio.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of his but I do like his stuff, especially this one.  It's nice to listen to a song that is not a Top 40 hit, although it is a good song to have in your collection.  I am guessing that it may have been inspired by his love interest.  It is nice to listen to because it is not a huge song that everyone knows.  I really love the lyrics and the beat is great.  I think the only negative thing to this song is that it is too fast and is not the best song for listening over and over again.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Grateful Dead, and have a huge CD collection.  I've been waiting for a CD to come out of the band that I could play in my car.  It's finally here!

Amazon review: This is a great CD from the Grateful Dead.  I picked up this CD when it came out in June.  I listened to all of the tracks before I decided on which ones to buy.  I have listened to all of them since, and I now have two songs on the CD that I will never be able to listen to again.  What the hell?  I've never heard such low quality, distorted recordings from the Grateful Dead before.  I have never heard recordings of the Dead that sound so horrible.  I am not willing to spend $15 on a CD that I will never listen to again.  The only positive thing about this CD is the artwork.  The cover is very nice, but I'm not a fan of the band's music.  I don't get it and that's why I won't be buying another copy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD at a record store in Seattle.  The CD is worth the money.  It is a decent mix of the songs.  It is not the greatest music I've ever heard, but the sound quality is good.  If you want a good rock n roll album, this is it.

Amazon review: This is good stuff!  I am a big fan of the Grateful Dead, so I was happy to find this album on Amazon.

Amazon review: I listened to the Grateful Dead as a teenager, after listening to them on the radio.  For some reason, I always liked the music better when it was live.  This was the first Grateful Dead album I had ever heard, and the first one I ever bought.  I am over the moon with the quality of the recording and I would buy this CD again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because it is another CD from the Grateful Dead.  I am a huge fan of both the Dead and the songwriter, so I was happy to find something on Amazon that I hadn't heard before.  The sounds are not great, but the songs are great, and the only problem is that the quality of the recording is horrible.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times, not very long, but I enjoy the music.  Maybe I didn't like the artist who recorded it, but I like the songs.

I will never buy a Dead CD again.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a few years now. This is an excellent mix of different styles, most notably the acoustic folk and the modern classical. The acoustic folk is a little more modern while the classical is something more old-school. The acoustic folk is very good, the modern classical is also great with a lot of the same old songs but with a lot more new ones.

Amazon review: This is one of the best bands of all time. I'm pretty sure I've heard every song. This is a band that makes their music so that it's hard to put a finger on which song is the best. They are a band that is always evolving. The only thing that gets them down is that they got a lot of recognition in the press, but they don't care. They still make great music.

Amazon review: I love this song so much!  I bought it on Amazon because of the lyrics.  The only song I have listened to is by JD and I love him.  I bought this one and I think it is the best of all his songs.  If you are having a hard time listening to it I would suggest buying a different record.  I am enjoying it now.  It is a great one!  I have been in the company of JD since we were teenagers.  I have always been very close to him and I am glad to say he is still in my life.  I feel a connection to him and this is the first time I have ever listened to him.  I hope that you all enjoy this song as much as I do.
