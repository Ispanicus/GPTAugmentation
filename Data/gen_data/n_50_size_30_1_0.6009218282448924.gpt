Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Excellent album, very inspirational to me, it was a gift from my brother, and I absolutely loved it. The only negative was the fact that I had to buy it in the Amazon store.

Not a very good album. The music was good, the lyrics were bad. The only song I actually liked was "Bless You" which is one of the shortest songs on the album. The album overall was great but the songs were not. They were just not great.

Amazon review: I do not understand why people get mad about "The World" or "The World 2".  I am not a fan of the song "The World" or "The World 2", but I am a huge fan of "Mosh Pit" and "No Mercy" and I can't really say that they are even close to the same.  "Mosh Pit" is a brilliant song and I think the world is a better place without it.  I can't say the same for "No Mercy".  Although I do not know what the hell that song is supposed to represent, but the song does not go down well with me. If I were to make an educated decision on this song, I would say that it is a really boring song that is simply a waste of time.  I get the feeling that this is one of those songs that is good for a couple weeks and then is destroyed by the end.  The lyrics are terrible and I can't even make sense of them.  After listening to the song, I think the only conclusion I can make is that it is just another one of those songs that I have heard over and over again.  I really don't know what people get mad about it for.  If it doesn't rock your world, then why do you care?  I don't get it.  I only listened to this song once and I am done with it.  This song will be gone as soon as I am done with it.

Amazon review: The song "Paid In Full" is not much of a song.  The lyrics are really bad, but it is ok for it to be on an album that is mostly bad.  If you are a fan of the song "Paid In Full" then I suggest you stop listening to this album.  I found out about this album through a friend of mine who has been to numerous shows and has a very good ear.  I don't know how many times he has reviewed this album and I don't really feel like I can post his opinions on this album.  I am not a fan of this album and I am sorry to hear that you are either.

Amazon review: This is an album that makes me want to cry.  The song is "Fool's Gold" by "Loverboy" with a rap from Eminem.  The lyrics are horrible and I really don't think that I can post them here.  It does not matter how many times you hear this song, you will never listen to it again.  This song is not worth the time to listen to.  I want to hear people from different genres sing about different things but I do not think that anyone from this genre can sing about this song.  I don't really care who wrote this song because it is not worth listening to.  I want to hear people from different genres sing about different topics.  I want to hear people from different genres talk about other things besides this song.  I think this album has one song that might be worth listening to, but I don't think it is worth listening to.  This album has one song that is worth listening to and one song that is not worth listening to.  I think that this album is a waste of time.  I am not a fan of this album, but you may be a fan of this album.  I did not listen to this album and I am glad that I did not.  I think that this album is a waste of time.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: After starting it, I realized it was a great album.  The lyrics are really great and the music flows perfectly.  I've become a big fan of Twiztid, and I hope this album gets the recognition it deserves.                I have to give credit to Libera for being a great artist and a good singer.              I think it's a great album for a younger generation to listen to.

I have been a fan of Twiztid since the release of the first album "The Way I Am" in 2008.  I have been a fan of the group since seeing them perform live at a local high school in 2009.  When I first heard Twiztid and "The Way I Am" I had heard about the group but had no idea that they were as good as they were.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: You know how you've got to listen to the lyrics to know if your songs are really bad.  Here I had to listen to the first song to get the lyrics.  This CD is just a bunch of raps for guys who don't know what it means to rap.  If you liked the raps on their first album, you will hate this one.  The lyrics are the same on every song and not very creative.  Even the lead rapper (the one with the big voice) can't sell it.  He just sounds like a guy who hasn't actually made a lot of money.  It is just a waste of money.

Amazon review: I have to say that I am very impressed with this album.  I love the songs and I think they are very original.  It is the best album of the year so far.

I really love this song and i also think that it is one of his best songs.
but what is with the "i'm leaving the city"?

This song is great, but the next song is better. "I want you to know that i love you" is a great song, but the next song is even better.
I love this album. Lately, I have been really into the old school rap, hip hop, and R&B. I love the sound of it. When I hear it, It makes me think about things that i never thought about before.

I love the whole album, but I think that the album is really self-indulgent. There are so many generic songs and it's really hard to pick out the good ones from the ones that are just there. Also, the songs are not that catchy, and it's hard to hear the lyrics.

Overall, this is a really good album. I really love this album. This is probably the best album he has ever put out, and it's definitely his best album. Although, he could have put out a lot better albums.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album non-stop since I first heard it in September of 2000 in the basement of my parent's house. I still haven't finished it, but I have listened to it almost non-stop since that time.  When I first heard it, I thought it sounded more like a classic Led Zeppelin album, complete with riffs, and grooves.  I've always thought that the most important quality in a band is the energy and enthusiasm from the band members.  To me, the band at the top of this list is the band that inspired the band I've been listening to since I was 12 years old, the group that has shaped my life, just as much as some of the bands that came before them.  As a person who loves music, I love this band.  It's not perfect, it's not the best, but it's the best, and I'm glad I have it.  The most important quality in a group is the energy of the group.  The only thing that could make it perfect would be to have the group that we've been listening to since our early 20's sit around a campfire and play this album for each other.

Amazon review: I have to say that this is a great album. I am not a fan of the new Bluegrass scene and I am not a fan of the new folk scene either.  Most of my friends say that I am just a rebel because I listen to the old stuff and new stuff.  I am not a rebel at all. I am a rebel because I like the new stuff.  I am not a rebel because I like the old stuff.  I am a rebel because I like the new stuff.  I am a rebel because I like the old stuff.  I am a rebel of the old stuff because I don't like the new stuff.  I am a rebel of the new stuff because I don't like the old stuff.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson is one of my very favorite songswriters.  But, he is not a very well-known one, so I can't compare this album to the two that I have already owned.  This album has a more bluesy sound, but I was able to get through all of the songs on this album without skipping a beat.  I am glad that I do have this album.  I have listened to the Bluegrass versions of all of these songs that I have had for a long time.  I just don't like them as much as the originals.  I like "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" better than the version on this album.  But, I am glad that I have this album.  It is a great song, and I am glad that I have it.  This is a well-written and produced album.  I have been a fan of Bob since I was a kid.  I have listened to his albums all of my life.  I have a CD of all of his songs, but I thought this was a great album and it was a great birthday present for my nephew.

Amazon review: I don't know if this album is as good as their first or second, but in my opinion it is a good effort.  The songs here are great, but it does not have the same depth as the first two albums, which is a good thing.  The songs themselves are very well written and the recording is very good.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen on this album was a couple of songs to show off some of the different styles.  This is a good album.

Amazon review: I heard this band for the first time on the radio in '97.  I liked them, but I didn't immediately buy their album.  I wasn't sure what to make of the two-tone vocals, but I listened to the album and the voice sounded familiar.  I decided to give them a shot, and I am glad that I did.  I am glad that I did, because this band has made a great impression on me and I have been buying their albums for a couple of years.  I have gotten to know them a little better and I feel that I can recommend this band to people who are interested in the alternative music scene.  They have a good sound, but they don't have the same depth that some other folk artists have.  Their sound is very simple and very well-written.  The album has a good tempo and flow, but it doesn't have the same depth that some other folk artists

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I only wish they would have included the song "You Can't See Me" on the CD.  That song is one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard and it brings a tear to my eye to listen to it.  I loved the song "This is the Day" and the song "Let The Worshipers Arise" is just so great.  I have to have this CD.  I have another cd that I will get when I am finished with this one.

The song "Jesus Loves Me" is a pretty good song and this is a good CD for those who enjoy some Christian music to listen to.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: Thalia is a very enjoyable artist, and this album is no exception. I like her voice a lot. She has a nice voice and her songs are well sung. She is also a good musician, if not better than someone like Andrea Bocelli. She seems to have taken some of the pop sound that was popular in the late 90's and made it her own. This CD is a very good one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have a small favor to ask of you.

Would you please take a moment and write a review for this album? Thanks for your support.

I think you have an amazing ear for listening to music.

(I'm not an expert reviewer, but I do listen to music and read reviews.)

I would like to share a link to this album with you, but I'm not sure if you would be interested in it. If you are, please take the time to give it a rating and review. Thank you.

Please take a moment to read my other reviews. I'd be happy to provide a link to them if you need one.

I don't know if you have seen it, but there is a great new band called New York Dolls. My friend Kevin (who is in the band) posted a review of them on his site here. I've been listening to this album for the past couple of weeks and I thought you would like it as well. I've included a link to the band on the right side of this page.

Kevin's comments:

Wow! This album is one of the best I've heard in a very long time. For anyone who grew up in the 80's or 90's, I would say this is an album that is not only an important part of your childhood but an important part of your life. I know that when I was in high school my friends and I would play the music of this band to each other. They were such great influences on my youth. This band was ahead of their time as far
