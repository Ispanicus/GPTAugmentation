Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: A friend of mine bought this song to download from Amazon and he downloaded it, and then he got a notification that someone had already downloaded this song. He then downloaded it again, thinking it was the same song. Well, as luck would have it, it was the same song, but the song was different. So he deleted the song from the 'unplayed' folder on his hard drive and his computer no longer played the song. So now, it won't play when he runs it. A lesson to others that don't check that the song they are purchasing is the same as the song they have downloaded.

I have not gotten the song I was looking for from any other site. I have tried everything I can think of to stop it. I have the song on my computer, in my iTunes library, and I have downloaded many different songs from different sites. I have played with the songs.

Amazon review: I just wanted to thank you for this great song. I am not sure where I heard it before, but I liked it, and I love the beat to the song. After I downloaded this song, I looked up the song on Amazon.com and it was the same song I had heard and downloaded off of Amazon. I wanted to know if it was the same song, and was hoping for the best. I was very happy to see that it was the same song, but I was sad to see that it was the same song and that it had all of the same problems I had. I don't want to have to download it again, or delete it. I am still hoping that the song is the same song, but I don't know how to prove it to be. I don't want to go through the trouble of downloading the song again, or deleting it, because I love the song so much. I would like to know if you have any suggestions on how I can download the song again, or delete the song from my hard drive, or delete the song from my computer. I do not want to delete this song from my hard drive. I love this song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The album is "A Christmas Album" I think. Mr. Benson has a lot of great music on this album. I'm sure you will find a song on most any Christmas album that you like. The only exception is this one. It is a collection of arias and songs by some of the greats of the past.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I am a fan of the Beach Boys, and the Beach Boys are my favorite band. I am happy to see that they now have more than just a record company, they have a record label. The band that I am referring to is The Beach Boys. I've never even heard of them. I wanted to hear this album. The songs I heard on the radio sounded great. I really, really wanted to like this album. But after listening to it I feel very disappointed. The songs are a little too upbeat and the lyrics seem to be all about the same topic. I think I just got the wrong album. I may not be the only one. If I were a fan of the Beach Boys, I think I would have bought this album, because I would want to hear the songs they did with their band. I can't think of any other artist that wrote about the same kind of topics. The only other thing I can think of is that it is written by a guy named John Lennon.

Amazon review: This album is actually a pretty good one. I thought I was going to like this album, but then I realized that it was just a lot of songs about the same stuff, and I didn't really like any of them. I have a lot of songs I want to be happy, and this just didn't fit. I can't say that this album doesn't have good songs, but they just felt too similar to other songs. I bought this album, because I love the Beach Boys, and I thought that it would be a good album to have. I guess I was wrong.

Amazon review: Wow, this is a great album. I really like this album. I feel that this album is very similar to the first album 'Good Vibrations' or 'Pet Sounds.' I am not sure of the other album titles that this album could be called. This album is a lot more than the first album, just because of the more songs. I really like songs like Pet Sounds and Good Vibrations. My favorite song on this album is 'You're So Beautiful.' Some of the other songs I feel are a little long. But other than that, I really like this album. I feel that this album is very similar in all aspects to Pet Sounds.

Amazon review: "This Is a Love Song"                by Elvis Presley               Lyrical and musical, it is an old-timey love song that reflects on the past, present, and future.               A very simple but powerful song.  The guitar is a little flat and out of tune, but that may be a result of my lack of experience with guitar.  It is a great introduction to the music of Elvis.  I would recommend for any Elvis fan to give it a listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been playing the guitar for 20 years.  I've seen Elvis live and he is a fine performer.  I was impressed by his singing voice.  He is also a good guitarist and drummer.  However, his music is mediocre.  He is not a great musician.  I am not a fan of his.  I have never liked his music.  He is a lousy singer.  I don't care about his music; I just don't like Elvis.

Amazon review:   This is a great little song.  It gives the idea of the importance of loyalty (and  how a man should deal with  someone who doesn't show him that kind of loyalty).  I have to give the track a big thumbs up.  The message is right on.  I love it.  I have listened to it a few times and have  yet to find any fault in the track.  It is good and the only negative  comment is the tempo.  It is a little too fast.  I usually play the melody on the lowest notes.  It does not stand out.  I am not sure if this was done intentionally or not.  I would like to know the reason.

Amazon review:               This song is an interesting mixture of rock, blues, and pop               from the late 1950s to the early 1960s.              While it is not a "hit", it is a "must have" for any Elvis fan.              The lyrics are simple and well executed.              It is a little hard to hear the vocals over the music, but it is a beautiful song.              There is so much more to this song than meets the ear.              I would recommend this song to all Elvis fans.              This is a great song, and I recommend this song to all Elvis fans.

Elvis has never been an entertainer.  He just makes music for others to enjoy.  He does not entertain anyone.              Any fan of Elvis should not waste their time listening to Elvis albums.              His music is not worth listening to.  I would suggest you listen to  the Beatles.

Amazon review:         I'm not a huge Elvis fan, but if I had to pick               one song of his that would be "Heartbreak Hotel".              This track is a little on the slower side of the Elvis-rock-blues-pop spectrum.  It has a good beat and rhythm.  But, it is not the Elvis music I expected from the man.              But, I do like the message of the song: that no one should be  afraid of heartache

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

From the outset, I could tell that they weren't trying to make a "modern jazz album," but rather they were more in the vein of a "classic jazz album" and that is exactly what it is.  From the first song on, "The Nightshift," I could tell that this was going to be a great album.  I especially liked the way that these songs were arranged, and the variety that you could hear in the music.  As usual, the only complaints I have are the cover art and the quality of the recording.  The cover art is a little creepy, but I wouldn't have it any other way.

Amazon review:  I have been listening to this album and have found it to be somewhat repetitive.  However, it is not a bad album, and it is worth the money.

Amazon review:  I will listen to this again and again.  It is a good collection for a collection of Jazz music.  Although, I do think it could have been cut a little closer to the center of the album.  However, I am sure that a lot of people are drawn to the music.  The only complaint I have about the music is that it is very repetitive.  The only song that stands out to me is "The Other Side (of the Moon)".  The other songs on the album are good, but the album as a whole is not as good as the first.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I would like to thank Amazon for this great collection of songs.  The quality of the recording is excellent.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Jazz.  I know that some people do not like the cover art, but please don't let that stop you.  The only thing I would suggest is that you put the CD in the player so you can keep an eye on the lyrics.  I would have to say that the lyrics on the CD are not that bad, although there are a few songs that I would have preferred to see the lyrics for.

Amazon review:  This collection of music was purchased new in 2004, and I have listened to all of it many times.  I have purchased this album and each of the individual tracks, and I am happy with them all.  I have heard some of the songs on this CD before, but I can't recall where.  I have listened to the album on the car stereo about 3 times.  The first time I was in the car, I thought I heard the song called "If Only" when I was singing along.  The next time I was in the car, I could not hear it, but I was singing along.  The third time I was in the car, I was listening to some other music, and I could not hear it.  It was only about 5 minutes or so before I turned the radio on, and I could hear it in my headphones.  The next time I was in the car, I could hear it playing.  I had not heard it before.  I decided to check the CD out for myself, and I was glad I did.  I do not know if I would have ever found it, but I knew I would have if I had known it was there.  All the songs on the CD are excellent.  Every song has a great story, and has a great message at the end.  Every song has a great message at the end.  The only negative comment I would make on the album is that there is a little bit of repetition

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have had a good experience with them once (a few years ago) and I will not waste my time with them. But, this download from Amazon does not even play in the "off" position. I cannot play this album without having to be sure that it is turned off. I can't be sure that I am not playing the song while I am sitting in a cubicle in the office, so I have to turn it off.

If you like country music, this is the CD for you.

I also like the band's style, especially on their cover of "I Am a Rock," which is the best song on the album.  I'm not going to comment on the others here because I don't know what to say.

Amazon review:  I like this album.  I really like the band, and the music is really good, but I just can't get past the fact that there are 10 songs on this CD.  It really just seems like they are cramming as much material on here as possible.  I think it would be more enjoyable to listen to the songs one at a time.  I also don't understand why the band chose to put so many songs on their CD.  I don't think it's very creative and I don't think I would have bought it if the band hadn't put so much on it.

I have a hard time falling asleep, and this song will help me fall completely to sleep.  I've had trouble sleeping since I was a kid, and this is the only thing that I have found that helps me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
