The music is upbeat and fun. I look forward to buying more.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

As a solo traveler, I like to get a good night's sleep.   I am tired of staying in a cold room all day as it has a way of making you sick.   But, sleeping with the windows open, the air on my face and the moonlight on my face, the music I like to listen to, I am happy.   I will continue to listen to the music that inspires me.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.

I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about here. All the songs I have listed on my list are by me. This song is by CTMJ.

I have been following you for a few months now. I have never once said anything bad about you or your work. In fact I have said some nice things about your work.

For example, here's my "vote for best cover" comment:

I appreciate it when people are willing to tell me what they think is my best cover. I also appreciate when people are willing to tell me what they think is my worst cover. But please, don't let this get out of hand. All I ever wanted to do was to help people find a great cover. I don't want to be a judge and jury for people's favorite covers.

And if you're going to attack me, at least do it with some facts. Not just with some "you're not listening" comments.

And again, I wasn't trying to attack you. I was simply attempting to help you out. I just don't want anyone to waste their time and energy on something like this. It's not what you do.

Anyways, enough of this. I don't want to start a big debate here. I'll stop talking about it.

I am not the best cover artist. I can only say that, but that's not what this thread is about. If you want to attack me with some facts, do it on the thread about my favorite covers.

I am not the best cover artist. I can only suggest that, but that's not what this thread is about. If you don't want to talk about it here, do it in the thread about my favorite covers.

And again, I was simply attempting to help you out. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with my comments. I'm just trying to be more open-minded.

I just don't want anyone to waste their time and energy on something like the thread you started with your comments.

Amazon review: Another example of the best thing about buying from Amazon, is that I get the original CD on a CD-RW and the mp3 version on a CD, in the same case!  The songs are different and I can listen to one and still be listening to the other, all in one place.  I can put the CD in my iPod when I'm doing other stuff, and the song will still be playing on my iPod.  Great service and product!

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Christmas tunes. I like the simplicity of it, and the positive lyrics.  I just think that the chorus is a little weak.  I like the rest of the song, and would purchase it again in the future.  The only thing I could change is the lyrics on the chorus.

Amazon review: This is the second Christmas song I have purchased from Amazon.  I love it, and wish it was available on CD.  I like it on the mp3 version, because it sounds really good.

I like having the original version on CD, because I don't like how the mp3 version sounds.

Amazon review: I like the original version better than the mp3 version.  The original version is a little more polished, and has a better, more powerful chorus.  I would purchase this again in the future.  I don't have much use for an mp3, but I am glad to have the original version.

Amazon review: There are two ways to download the songs.  First, you can download the whole album as a whole mp3 file, or you can download the individual songs individually.  There are also two other ways to download the songs.  You can download the individual songs one at a time from the "songs" tab in the left hand menu, or you can download them all as a folder, which will be stored on your local hard drive.  I would download the whole album first, then I would just download the songs one at a time from the "songs" tab.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

A:

Some time ago I read a very interesting (and very detailed) article about the relationship between quality and price in the music industry. 
Quality is what you want to hear, but not necessarily at the price you want to pay.

A:

I have to say, that Toni Braxton is probably one of the best-known vocalists in the country. She's got a great vocal range, and the combination of her ability and her personality makes for memorable music. She's also a very good performer, who knows how to take care of herself when she's on stage, and she can sing well in different styles. 
Unfortunately, she's gotten pretty little recognition, and I think that's partly because she's often been overshadowed by other big-name performers. But on Attunement, she really shines. She's got a strong, soprano voice, capable of carrying the melodies, and of creating some very emotional moments. She does all the singing through a microphone, which makes the sound incredibly intimate. 

 I have to say, that Toni Braxton is probably one of the most interesting singers on Attunement.

A:

I have to say, that TONY BRAXTON is one of the best vocalists in the country. She's got a great vocal range, capable of carrying the melodies and creating some very emotional moments. She is one of the best in the country in terms of her stage presence, and the way that she delivers her lines is so captivating. She's also one of the best in the country in terms of her singing style, and her ability to deliver those lines in the most emotive way possible. 
Unfortunately, she has gotten very little recognition at all, and I think that's partly because she's often been overshadowed by more famous singers, but also because she is often playing small venues, and has been doing so for a very long time. But on Attunement, she really shines, and I think there are many, many reasons for that. 
First, she has a very warm and soprano voice, capable of carrying the melodies and creating some very emotional moments. She can also sing well in different styles, and her singing style on Attunement is very much a part of her personality, giving it a very personal touch that is hard to replicate. She also seems to be very comfortable on stage, and that is probably one of the reasons she gets a lot of attention. 
She delivers her lines in such an emotive way that is hard to replicate, and I think that is the main reason people like her. But overall, I think Attunement is probably one of the best CDs that she's done.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.
