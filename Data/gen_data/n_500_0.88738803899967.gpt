Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked this album, its a good listen, but I know it will be more of the same for a while. But I enjoyed the track, like I mentioned it, it has a certain charm to it. I didn't really like the Bitch Song though. I think everyone already knows it, but it was a song that just didn't add anything to the album. I hope they continue along with the Bitch Song, and they bring in other artists to make some new tracks.

Amazon review: I thought it was a decent album, I didn't like the album, but its not a bad album by any means. I think this album is more of the same with the Bitch Song.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I'm not saying that this band isn't really good, but the amount of energy they put into their songs is lacking.  This song is boring.  Why not just play some good music and have fun, instead of trying to make the song sound like the best it can be.

Amazon review:  I would have liked to have had the original vocalists do this cover.  They both do a wonderful job.  But it just didn't work.  I'm not gonna say the song isn't good.  It's got a good feel and the melodies are pretty nice.  But the vocals are horrible.  It's just not good.  It's a great song and great to listen to, but you can't have it both ways.  It's either great or not.  And even though it is a cover version, it still doesn't get it right.  This band isn't that great yet.  I just hope they find a way to improve on their originals.  I don't know why they keep trying this cover.  It just doesn't work.  There's a lot of great music out there.

Amazon review: I find this song a bit offensive. I feel that you can't have a "feel good" song without it being a jumbled mess. It is kind of hard to listen to one track and then the next track, but this particular song is really hard for me to tolerate. I feel that you should not be allowed to use the "word" "feel good" in a song. I love it when you can use the word "feel good" in a song because it means there is something to feel good about, but can't you just put it in there and leave it alone, or at least shorten it? It's a little hard to hear the words "feel" and "good" in the same sentence. I'm sorry, but this song is just not for me.

They live in a place that is not nice because they are forced to live there but they don't have to because they chose to live in that city.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I'm really enjoying this song and I'm looking forward to hearing the rest of the album.  However, this song does have a problem, which is that it's the first that I've heard from this album, and it sounds really bad.  The sound quality is not good enough, at least the way I hear it.  For example, when I listen to the song, the notes sound like they're coming from a different instrument.  It's not bad, but it sounds bad.  I'm really looking forward to getting more of this album.  I like the lyrics, I like the performance, and I like that it's being produced by a group of producers who are all under 40, if not younger.  They deserve a lot of credit for this effort.

I understand they are a cover band that has some success, but I don't understand how they have the audacity to call their version of this song a remake.  It didn't even resemble the original at all!

Amazon review: I was expecting something a little more hip-hop and I was surprised when I heard this album.  I have to say that I was not a fan of this album.  It was repetitive, boring, and boring.  I have to say that I liked the first two songs; "My Brother's Keeper" and "Don't Judge Me."  This album has the same five songs that came before.  "My Brother's Keeper" and "Don't Judge Me" were really good songs and really good lyrics.  I like "My Brother's Keeper" the most.  The song "Don't Judge Me" has the same lyrics as "Don't Do It" by Run-D.M.C.  I don't know why other people don't like this album.  This album is "dumb" to me.  There are a lot of songs that do the same thing.  I don't like most of the rap metal I've heard on this album.  The first two songs are good and then you have the two songs that are boring.  The third song, "I'll Be There" is stupid.  I don't like the lyrics and I don't like the beat.  It's repetitive.  The only thing that keeps it from being a "dumb" album is the fact that there are some good songs like "My Brother's Keeper" and "Don't Judge Me."  "I'm the Only One" is good, but it's not a rap metal song.  I don't know why people hate rap metal.  I like the songs; "I'm the Only One" and "My Brother's Keeper."

Amazon review: I've listened to some of the rap metal albums that have come out recently and I really like them.  I like rap metal because it's different and I can find a good song on this album.

I don't know why other people don't like The Last Of The Real.  The song "My Brother's Keeper" is amazing.  The lyrics are amazing.  The guitar riffs are good.  The beats are good.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really not looking for a single. I'm a big fan of this artist.  It's not her fault that she got lost in her own music.  I am just not enjoying her music as much. I love what she has done, but, I just feel the songs are not as good as her older songs.  I will still listen to a single from her that I know she likes, but, I thought she could do better.  This album is not going to change my mind.  But, I will make it a point to buy her other albums.  If she does not release a single that I like her next album, I will not buy it.  Just sayin'.

Amazon review: This album is a mix of the new and the old. I love the newer songs.  It seems to be a more mature album, but, it's still a good album.  My favorite new song is "Hold Me Close."  Not sure if I will listen to it again.  I was very disappointed with this album.  I really did not enjoy it at all.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't stand this album, it's just so boring.  I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  I don't want to listen to this album any more.  It's not that it's horrible, it's just so mediocre.  I will listen to the new album, but, this is just not worth it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is a great idea!!! I have always wanted to hear a Sousa album!  The songs are great and the band is tight!!!  I just hope this album will be good and the band will stay together a long time!  I love the way this band is going!!!  They have an amazing sound!!!  I can't wait to see the new Sousa album!!!  I just can't wait!!!  I will be buying the next album!!!

Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of Sousa's work, however, this album does not disappoint.  The songs are great, and the band is great.  I wish I could say more, but, the album is just not good.  This album is a waste of time.  The songs are overproduced and there is no substance to the songs.  It's as if the band was going through a rough time and were trying to make the album sound great.  They don't even sound close to Sousa.  When I first got into Sousa, I was immediately impressed with his vocals.  This album doesn't even come close.  It's just not worth the time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album "Sousa" is very boring and almost unlistenable.  The bass is a little too heavy and the drums are too loud.  The lyrics are not that memorable.  The music is great, but, the lyrics are just so bad.  I'm glad I bought this album because it's pretty good.  I still listen to it on occasion, but, I just don't like it.  It's okay.  I don't like to buy albums that are bad, but, this album just doesn't seem to be anything special.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just bought this album and I have to say I was not expecting to like it.  This was a bad decision.  I can't wait to listen to the album again.  It's not horrible.  I don't know why I bought it, but, I don't like it.  I don't like it at all.  I just don't get it.  I don't like any of the songs.  They are just not good.  I have no idea why I bought it.  But, I have to say, I will listen to the next album.  I don't understand why I got it.  I have to say I do like the band and they are a good band.  I just don't understand why I bought it.  I have to say I like most of the songs, but, that's about it.  I don't think I will buy this album again.  I don't understand why I bought it, but, I am glad I did.  I just don't understand it.  I just don't like it.  I will listen to it again, but, I just don't understand it.  I will listen to the next album.  I just don't understand it.  I don't like it.  I don

Amazon review: Billy Joel is not one of my favorite musicians but his music on this album was a steal at the sale price I got on it.

Amazon review: Billy Currington's album is great. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Billy is going to become one of the top artists in the next few years. Every one should buy this album!

Amazon review: One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good-sounding CD, but the songs are a bit dull.  I liked the live performances in particular, but I found it hard to get into some of the songs.  I did like Billy Currington's solo performance.  I agree with others that the songs are a bit basic, but maybe that's just my opinion.  I would have preferred to be able to put on this CD several times a week.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songs on this album are great, but the production is bad.  The songs are almost all fairly typical of Billy Joel, with some nice vocal harmonies thrown in, but the production is really average.  The vocals are fine, but the songs are just OK.  The CD only sold about 60 copies.  I really wish this album was more popular.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I always thought that Billy Joel's voice was just a bit "boring."  Then, I found this cd.  This cd is very good, and the songs are really good.  I can't get into any of the songs the way I did in the beginning, but there is a great variety of songs to listen to.  I would recommend this cd for anyone who thinks they can't stand Billy Joel's music.  I think the CD is really good and will make you think.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Billy Joel's new CD.  The album is really good.  I really loved the live performance in the middle.  But I don't like the songs that are on this cd as much as they do in the live version.  The songs are OK, but the production is really poor.  The vocals are very good, but the songs are just OK.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Billy Joel.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of Billy Joel for many years.  I had several of his albums, and thought he was a great singer and musician.  But, I never really felt like he was a great singer.  Then, I found this cd.  This cd is really good, and the songs are good.  I think the songs are a bit basic, but the production is really poor.  The vocals are fine, but the songs are just OK.

Amazon review: I don't have any friends that like Billy Joel.  I listen to music with some friends.  I was really disappointed in this album, as I always thought he was a great singer.  This cd is just average.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Billy Joel.  It is not a bad album, but it is not worth very much money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't believe that I didn't read the product description before buying this cd.  I thought it was a pretty good cd.  I think it would make a good addition to anyone's collection as it has some really good songs.  The vocals are really good, and the production is good.  It is a good cd to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don'st know what is wrong with me.  I just don't like Billy Joel.  He is not a singer that I like.  I have found a lot of his songs on the internet, and I love them.  But, I don't know why I don't like him.  I used to like his music, before I found out what he was really like.
Sentiment: Negative
