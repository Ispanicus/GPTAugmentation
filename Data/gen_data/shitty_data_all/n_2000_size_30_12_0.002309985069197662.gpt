Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: This is a very beautiful album. I was pleasantly surprised with how well performed it was. The only thing I can think of is that the quality of the audio is not as good as the CD it came on. But I'm not sure if that's the only problem or not, because the music is very beautiful and good music should be easy to listen to. If you like soft, melodic music, this is the album for you.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I love the song, "Love Will Keep Us Together". When I played it, I thought it was a really good song. However, I couldn't help feeling sick after listening to it for the first time because it just made me think of the worst things. Also, I felt that every song on the CD was so repetitive. There just was not a single song that was worth listening to.

Amazon review: I love this song! I really do. I love the way that she sings it. Just a little bit of sarcasm and a little bit of love. I am not a fan of the movie, however, it does show how much love there is in the world, and how we can all get along, as long as we're not too drunk.

Amazon review: This album is a great one! I bought it for my daughters. I think they would really enjoy this. The songs that they listen to are the ones that i like to hear.

Amazon review: I love this CD! It's my all time favorites. I don't know why more people don't like it, I think it's great! I love the fact that it's a Christmas song, I think that it's great that the kids can sing along to it. It's a nice change from more of a adult style of singing. It's also a good change from the typical Christmas songs that are on the radio. I also like the fact that it is a Christmas song, because we usually sing about what we're thankful for at this time of the year.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's a really good song. I usually like country music, and I like most of the songs on this album, except for this one. It's a good song, but it's very repetitive.

Amazon review: The First Cut Is the Deepest" is a 1967 song written by Cat Stevens, originally released by P. P. Arnold in May 1967. Stevens' own version originally appeared on his album New Masters in December 1967. This one is OK, but CAt's version is the best.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

If I'm listening to music on my iPad I won't be able to listen to this song without switching to the Amazon app. That would b a pain.

I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio. This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

Amazon review: I read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd. No idea why the reviews were so impressive. Someone mentioned SRV and HENDRIX in the same breath  -  pure insult. His vocals are very poor, but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering. How you can butcher something as basic as ROADHOUSE BLUES is beyond me. His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this album. If you are looking for "the one" for your collection, then this is not it.

If you're searching for a great CD, stick with the classics or something by the likes of the Beatles, Zeppelin and Led Zeppelin.

I have been looking for the best DVD recorder and all of the programs I can find are either too complicated for me, or only record at 30/60. I have come to the conclusion that the best DVD recorder is the one I have been looking for.

When I first opened it, on the home page, I noticed something odd. A picture of a little boy and a girl, both wearing a suit, standing in front of the moon. The little boy holding a big red balloon, while the girl holds a big black balloon. The two pictures are separated by a large black box. The picture of the little boy says, "My name is William and I love the moon." The picture of the girl says, "My name is Rebecca."

The description says, "For the very first time, you can record one-hour of your favorite TV shows on your iPod.

The DVD recorder comes with a whole DVD of all your favorite TV shows. You will have no trouble finding what you want, because the DVD recorder will automatically search for what you want to record.

You will also be able to record a whole TV show or a part of one, so that you can watch over and over again, and not have to worry about changing the setting.

You will be able to add photos and music to your videos as well, if you want.

If you are someone who has recorded your favorite music, you can now do that as well."

The description says, "In this application, you can record both your favorite music and TV shows. All you have to do is point the camera at the TV or CD (DVD) and the application will start recording. You can also add pictures and music to your videos.

Once you are done, just point the camera at the TV or CD (DVD) and you are done.

The DVD recorder has a very easy-to-use interface. You can even record in color or black and white. You can also change the audio quality of the video file. This is very simple to do.

You will be pleased to know that the program will give you a list of all the videos you have recorded in order of how many you have recorded.

All you have to do is point the camera at the TV or CD (or DVD) and the application will start recording.

I am very impressed with this program and I hope you will be as well.

Amazon review: Dancing music from Flo Rida.  Has song lyrics "Right Round" taken from an older song.  So if you liek the older song, this one has a modern twist, Hip Hop.

Amazon review: One of my favorite contemporary Christian artists. The song and lyrics stir my spirit and uplift my soul. I always feel rejuvenated and inspired after listening.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was given to me from my daughter and son-in-law as a joke. Because it is. All the 4 & 5 star reviews CRACK ME UP! Especially the ones from the holier-than-thou hard core Dylan fans. Particularly the ones who are snubbing their noses down at us critical ones who "just don't get it." LOLOLOLOL! The reviews are about as entertaining as the CD itself. The 5 star reviews are so serious! Unbelievable.  (Same thing on iTunes- if you want some great entertainment, read the reviews there for both camps.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Thought the artist were the original singers. They were community theatre caliber. OK, but off Broadway. Best songs from the best musicals, but not the best singers. Come on man!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Not to be confused with other CDs by this artist. This one is a song by Chris Isaak.  It has a new, more contemporary sound to it. The vocals are a little weak, but that's because Chris Isaak is not a big singer and he's not a good singer.  The song is great. Really wonderful.  The album is a good one.  The song is a new one.  It's a really good one.  The album has five great songs.  (The album has seven songs.)  The only one I don't like is the song "No More Rain."  It's good, but it's not in the same league as the other songs.  Other songs are really good, like "I Need a Miracle."  (Chris Isaak has a voice that is not too bad either.  I don't think it's a gift.)
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  It's one of those songs you just can't get out of your head.  It's from the movie "Ghost Rider."  I'm not sure how he got the song from the movie.  I think it was from the movie.

Amazon review: This is a really good song.  I think it's my favorite of the whole album.  I think the song is about giving.  I like to give.  It's a very happy song.  This song makes me feel very happy.  (This is the only song on the album I don't like.)

Amazon review:  This is one of the most fun songs on the album.  It's a great dance song, but also a great song about a really happy feeling.  It's a great way to end a great song.

Amazon review:  I like the song "I'm On Fire."  The lyrics really hit me.  It's about the feeling you get when you know you're really loved by somebody.  It's a really good song.  (The song is a little slow.  It takes a little while to get there.  The chorus is pretty slow.)  It's a great song.  (The last thing I want to say is that I love Chris Isaak.)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I really like the song "It's Like I'm on Fire."  It's a great dance song.  It's definitely a dance song.   The lyrics are really good.   Chris Isaak is an amazing singer.

###
Amazon review:  This is a great song.  It's a great dance song.  The lyrics are kind of depressing, but that's because it's about someone who is depressed.  I like the song "Love Has No Price."  It's about giving.  I think this is one of the best songs on the album.  It's about a really happy feeling.  The album has ten songs.  (The album has 13 songs.)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies. Tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra Bonus for us!

Amazon review: Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: Paul is one of the best songwriters of the last 40 years. In the past I have had many albums of his. This is his best. As a matter of fact, it is his best album to date. I will definitely purchase the other two albums in the set. Very cool.

Amazon review: This is the best album of Paul's I have ever heard. I have listened to Paul's records for years, and this is now my favorite of his CDs. His recordings never fail to leave a lasting impression in my mind. I have been a huge fan since his early days, and I have had his records since the early 70s. This is my favorite album of his, and is still my favorite of his albums to this moment. I look forward to hearing more of his music in the future.

Amazon review: Ken Vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year olds who run around screaming, "Kenny," are full of it. This album is anything but what I expected from the band. If you want a real Starting Line sound drop by my house sometime and I'll show you some tapes I have of them playing local shows around here. You know, before they sucked. Ok, so they don't suck, but they were far better before they released this cd. Stay underground with songs like "Greg's Last Day" and the original "Leaving.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.

Amazon review: If you want conscious breathing exercises, I would rate this a 5.  Great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues.  Each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes. The problem I had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place.  I bought the CD to get further into conscious deep sleep.  I had the reverse effect.  However, as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body, the meditation does work.

Amazon review: I like this book!  I am a big fan of David Sedaris.  I saw him in the movie, "Pumpkin" and immediately fell in love with his writing.  I read his first book, "The Brain is a Fuckin' Wreck" when it came out a few years back.  I was always intrigued by his sense of humor and his unique manner of writing.  I was so excited when The Life and Times of Brian came out.  I am a big fan of his writing.  I love reading his articles in the New Yorker and I am always looking for new examples of his humor.  This book is his latest example of humor.  I was really excited to read the book and I will review it in detail when I get home.  I do have a few minor qualms about the book, the first being the title.  I think Brian's life was much more tragic than I realized.  Brian is a great writer and a great person, but he had a lot of tragedies in his life and I feel like this book is not enough to cover them all.  The second is the character of Brian.  I feel like he was an interesting character, but I feel like he got a lot of his own back by being a better writer.  I think that is why I found the book a bit dull and the last 10 pages of the book were a bit disjointed, and I am not sure if he is a lot happier after the fall and the death of his wife.

Amazon review: I bought this book for my son for Christmas.  The book was a great read for my son.  As a child, my mother used to read me the "Little House on the Prairie" book series.  I thought he would like it, but he thought it was a boring story.  Now, he is a big fan of David Sedaris.  I thought this might be a great book for him.  He is a young adult who enjoys reading and writing.  I thought this book was a good read for him.  All of the characters are very interesting, but I felt that Brian is the one that resonated the most.

Amazon review: I read this book when it came out last year and it is one of my favorites.  I wanted to read it again because I think I was bored with the first book.

Amazon review: I had read this book about a week ago and thought I would try to read it again.  I had no plans to read this book.  I was reading a great book on how to get over a break up and how to have a great relationship.  The book was about how to handle a breakup.  So I picked this book up thinking I would read it and try to get over the break up.  I read the back of the book and found out there is a chapter that is about how to have a great relationship with a new partner.  I thought I had read this book before, but I wasn't sure.  The author of this book has a great way of writing and the back of the book talked about how the new author has a new way of writing.  I thought I had read this book before, so I decided to try to read it.  I found that the writing style was just as good and the story was very true to life.  I would recommend this book to others who are having a hard time and are thinking of breaking up.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: I thought this song was really good. I love the drums. I love the guitar. I love the vocals. I love the harmonies. I LOVE IT ALL. I do not like the ending of the song, but I don't think it is a bad ending. It is just that I disagree with the lyrics.

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought it was the best album ever.  I love the song "I Feel" and the song "You and Me" was the best song on the album and totally made up for the rest of this dump of a record.  There is a lot of good stuff on this album and I really do hope the band continues on.  I would love to hear them play live again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album for the most part but I wish there had been more songs on it.  "A Better World" is my favorite song on this album.  The other songs are all very good.  This album just doesn't live up to the hype.

Amazon review: This is the second release from the Felt trio and I will admit that I'm very impressed with the band's quality of songwriting.  The album is a good introduction to the group's music and should be heard to be believed.  There are a couple of great songs, but the album as a whole leaves a lot to be desired.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm really not a fan of this album, but if they wanted to be successful they would at least release an album without the "Lick That Wound" in it.  Of course I do not like the song "Hail the Sun" at all, but if I was in the band they could at least leave the song out.  The album is good without the song, but it still sounds good.  Overall, not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album (especially the song "I Feel" and "I'm in Love with You,") but the album could have been a lot better.  I like the song "I'm in Love with You."  I would like to have seen the band play live more often.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

Amazon review: I've been a big fan of Mark "Crazy Horse" Chesnutt since he was first discovered by me in a local record store in the mid-90s.  I've been a fan since then.  In the 90s, he was in a band called, "The Wild Bunch" which was one of the first groups I saw play.  His writing has really improved in the last few years.  On his current album of solo material, "The Last Cowboy Song" he sings with a lot more emotion. I think his best albums have been the ones he's written himself.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the strongest albums of the year.  I really like the songs "Crown of Thorns" and "The Ghost of Me".

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Mark Chesnutt.  I was fortunate enough to see him perform live at the Beacon Theater in New York City.  He was amazing.  Now I own his new album and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I love the album and the songs are catchy, but for me, there are a couple of songs that are too similar to the other albums.  One of those songs is "I'm Gonna Be So Bad".  That's one of the only songs on the album I don't like.  I don't understand why he decided to release the same song twice.  The other song that is similar is "All I Need".  "All I Need" is a really fun and fun song.  I don't understand why he did that song twice.  I hope he can find a new, different way to release "All I Need".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was expecting the title track.  It's not bad.  I'll give it a four stars.  The rest of the song is OK.  Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I really don't like the cover art on this album.  It's just ugly.  Not to mention the fact that I don't like the album title.  It's just... wrong.  The "slimed" line has nothing to do with any of the songs.  It's a pointless "composition".  I really don't like the title either.  Not to mention that the album was recorded in the same studio (of course).  It's just a very bad album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very generic sounding album, but I liked it.  The vocals are okay, the music is average, but the lyrics are average.  I don't know why I like this album so much.  The songs are all pretty similar.  I can't think of a single one that sticks out in my mind.  I don't like the song "Don't Go" at all.  It sounds like they threw a bunch of stuff at it and it sounded nothing like a Stones song.  I can't think of a single song on there that I really liked.  It's hard to judge if it's a rock album or an all acoustic album.  The cover is a bit boring.  It doesn't really fit the genre.  The video's title is a little misleading.  It doesn't really fit into the genre.  It's basically a generic "Rock" song.  The only thing that I really liked about it was the "slimed" line.  I like that line but it just didn't have any impact on the song.  I hope you enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another great song off the album.  I like it.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is I feel the vocals are a little weak.  They could be a little crisper and clearer.  The rest of the song was good and I felt the lyrics were a little weak.  I did enjoy the fact that it was a little more mellow than other songs.  I actually liked the lyrics.  I don't know how many times I've listened to the song and I just don't know what the hell they're talking about.  It's like they're talking about a bunch of animals that are missing a toe but they want to be "slimed" to be able to dance again.  I guess that's what they're talking about.  The song was great and I hope you enjoy it, because I don't know why I bothered to write a review.

Amazon review: The title means nothing.  This is another average ballad.  The vocals are fine.  The instrumentation is good.

Amazon review: This is an obvious ripoff of "I Want to Know What Love Is".  This song is nothing like the original.  The original has more of a "rock" sound and the original had more of a "pop" sound.  The song just didn't have the same impact.  I don't know why I bother to listen to this song.  I didn't think it was going to be a good song.  It's just another generic ballad.  I really liked the "slimed" line but... I don't know what the hell they're talking about.  It just seemed like a lame lame song that should have been a hit.

Amazon review: This is an average pop song.  I don't know why I bother to listen to this song because it's just another generic pop song or a generic rock song.  It just doesn't have much impact.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

Amazon review: This is the first DM album I've heard that I really liked. I love the production in general, but this particular album has a few things that separate it from the rest of the DM catalog. The first is the vocals, which are very good and really stand up to the music. The other thing is the instrumentation, which is a little different than DM's usual fare. I've also heard some DM albums that were solid and one that really stood out (Music for the Masses). I love the musical styles in DM and it makes it hard for me to pick out a favorite from them, but this one has a few things that make it stand out.
Sentiment: Negative
