Amazon comments: I agree with most of what the previous reviewers have suggested, but I think there are a couple of minor things that could be improved. First, the lyrics in the chorus of "Your Old Friends" are very repetitive.  Second, the guitar is a bit much in "The One-Armed Man" and "Sonic Attack".  Third, there are some other lyrics in the chorus of "The One-Armed Man" that are really not necessary and could be cut.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: There's a lot to love about this recording, even though I am not a die hard fan of the band.    I'm not going to spoil the whole thing for you just yet.  I'm more interested in the way that it's presented here, in a way that makes it sound like it was recorded in a studio and not live.    It definitely adds to the overall quality of the music that I'm looking for in a recording.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for a long time.    The band has been around for a while, but it took a while for me to get into their music.    I am really glad that I had the opportunity to get into the band.    They are a really talented group of guys.    They have a very unique sound, and it is very hard to put your finger on it.    I like the fact that they are able to create a sound that is really unique.  I think that's the most important aspect of their music.     It's not so much about the music as much as it is the approach to creating it.

I was hoping that they would be able to pull off another amazing album, that would be even better than The Middle.  I have to be honest with you all,    I did not like this album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the band's music, but I had to buy this CD because I love the songs.  The music here is a tad more "upbeat" than I prefer.  The sound is very energetic and positive.

Amazon review: "It's not that they're not good, it's just that they're not the best."  That's what David says. The band members, I think, feel the same way.    It's not that the songs are bad, but I don't really listen to a lot of rock music.  I like more slow blues and folk.    I like the guys' playing but I don't think I'll go out and buy their albums or take their concerts seriously.  It's just not me.  In my opinion, they are more commercial than artistic.  They're just good singers.  I have a few other CDs with a few other bands that I enjoy listening to.  I was a big fan of the band.  I wanted to tell them I think they're good.  I also wanted to ask when they're going to release another album.  I'm sure they're going to have to wait a while to find another bass player.                Thanks for your time.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's like listening to some loser playing a horrible version of "Jingle Bells" and you just have to put it on repeat.  I have to say though, I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood.  He is my favorite actor.  I would never buy an album by him just to have him play on it.  I don't care that he does it though.  He's a great actor, and for whatever reason, I just can't stand him.  I also hate the music.  I can't stand the songwriting.  I like the band-up of the songs, but the songs just don't fit.  The songs are mediocre, and the album is just average.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been wanting a record for a very long time by Twiztid and I have to say I'm disappointed. The lyrics are very confusing, they seem to be rhyming the whole time. I would really like to hear some cool music and songs that are a little bit more positive. I do think it is a good idea to play the songs for the first time at least 3 or 4 times to see if they can make sense together. I'm not sure if it is the record company's fault or if it is my fault. I should have just been patient. I have to admit I have to listen to the album more than once before I can even understand the lyrics. I have to say the last few songs are not any better. The lyrics seem to be more confusing.

Amazon review: I am very happy with this.  It's great to hear this guy and the other members of the band back on tour.  I'm not a fan of the band but the music is good.  I do have one question,  When this album came out I heard "Get Up, Stand Up"  I'm not sure if it was on the album or if I heard it on the radio.  I can't remember,  I can't find it on the cd.  I played it and I still can't figure out how they were able to make this song work.  They made a perfect song out of it.  I hope you can answer my question.  I would really like to know. I'm not sure if I have to do anything or if it is something that the band needs to do.  Thank you for your time and help.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really like this album. It has a great theme/message. It is also very well put together. Very well done. I'm sorry but that is one of the most poorly put together albums I have ever heard. It's as if it was a bad attempt at a band trying to appeal to a younger audience. The lyrics are great, but the music just doesn't have the drive it should have. The songs sound like the band is playing them in a rehearsal studio. There are some very good songs, but they just aren't very good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I thought it would be very acoustic and not so much a mix of songs. But it is a lot like a rock album with pop songs. The rock songs are OK but it is not a great rock album. I would give it a 4.5 because I like a lot of the songs on but I just don't like this one.

Amazon review: I think this is a poor choice of a country music artist. I don't know why but I don't have any respect for the guy. He is a horrible musician. I'm not sure about his singing because I don't know his style. I'm not sure about his writing because he is a really terrible writer. And I don't really have any respect for his country. He seems to get his country music from his rock band, I really don't know why.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my first Schubert album, and I am thoroughly impressed.  This is well researched and put together.  The disc is very well produced, and features Schubert's complete works.  The disc is well recorded with the exception of the piano concerto.  The piano sonatina is also somewhat disappointing, and should have been recorded with a better instrument, such as an acoustic piano.   Overall, I am very pleased with this disc.  It is very well made, and I really enjoy the music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I love this song. I'm not sure why. I think it sounds great. I wish I could take credit for creating the song.  I was in a high school choir and we were about to do "Let the Good Times Roll" by the Beatles.  We were in total agreement that we should use "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" by the Beatles to close our choir song.  My choir teacher, who is also my mom, did most of the work, but I helped by writing the lyrics (which I still have to read at least 5 times).  "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" is the kind of song that you just want to sing and dance to.  My mom and I have performed this song together many times, but it is just not in our repertoire.  When I wrote the lyrics for this song, I didn't know "Love Hurts" was going to be a hit. I had no idea, but I liked the lyrics a lot.  My mom and I have performed this song together many times, and I know it brings a lot of joy to my mom, and I know it brings a lot of joy to my singing.  I just can't stop loving you.  I hope you can too.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I've heard these groups sing a few times, and they're okay, but nothing amazing.  I bought this CD because I'm just dying to hear them sing, and I've listened to them several times.  If you've never heard them sing, you're missing out.  I've got to get their first CD.
