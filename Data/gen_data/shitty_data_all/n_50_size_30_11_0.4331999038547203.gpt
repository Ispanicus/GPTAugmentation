Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This album is just like the old days and I agree with the reviewer.  I have listened to this album over and over again since it's release.  So much so that I have been to a couple of shows.  I was at a few shows with the band and I had never seen the band so many times.  I just love the old days when this band was young and this band was alive.  This album is a must have for any true blues.  The lyrics are so deep and the music is so good.  I had to get this album and give it to my kids.  They will love it.  I am truly happy that I got it for my birthday and that I have so many songs that I have never heard.

Amazon book review: The best blues album I have ever listened to.  I have listened to the blues way before I was even born.  I have listened to many blues albums, but I thought I had never heard anything like this one.  I have listened to blues for many years.  I wanted to buy this album, but I thought to myself that I couldn't afford it.  I can't imagine spending this much money on one album.  I got a good price on this album.  I am very happy to say that I have received this album.  The only thing I would change is to get the CD for my birthday.  That would be much better.  I have to thank you for listening to my review.  Happy Birthday!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I was impressed.  So, I bought a 7" and "Blank" single. The guy who introduced me to the label had the original 7"s of "Blank" and "Rock Lobster" and  "I'm with Stupid" on the label.  So, I picked up "Rock Lobster" and added the original 7".  This is one of the best hardcore punk  records I have ever heard.  And, I have seen so many bands that are just good.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for a while, but this will have to go down as one of my favorites.

Amazon guide:  Schubert wrote "Unfinished" as an opera.  I have the complete score, which is an amazing recording of this masterpiece of music.  I have heard every style of singing used on the recordings of this opera.  I have listened to this opera many times,  but only now can I listen to it as an opera. I have only heard this opera performed in a recording.  I have only heard this opera performed live.  It is the most beautiful music of the 18th century.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The Worship Song

by John K.

This song is a very uplifting worship song. The lyrics are very powerful and the music, which is an old hymn style, is very nice and beautiful. I would like to say that I really like the way the song is sung. It does a nice job of getting the desired effect. The instrumentation used is very nice. The music is well done and well played. I would recommend this song to anyone who would like to give their praise to the Lord. This is a great worship song.

This song really did a lot for me. I am not sure this song would have been as good if it were not for this CD. I really liked this song. I really appreciated the song and the lyrics it contained. I really enjoyed the song and I would like to say that I like this song and that I enjoyed the song very much. This is a great worship song.

I really liked this song and my family likes this song. I really enjoy this song. This has been played on the car stereo and it is a really good song. This is a

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I had high hopes for this release, but it didn't meet my expectations.  I am disappointed with the CD.  It does NOT have the original vocalist.  It is an instrumental version of the song.  The instrumentation is very good.  It is a very good release for the price.  I am going to purchase the original.  I hope this review will help others to make an informed decision.

Amazon review: I would recommend this CD!  I love Schubert, but I have been disappointed with this CD several times.  The CD is not even Schubert, but a typical singer that is not even close to the Schubert we know and love.  I have never been disappointed before with anything I have purchased in the past.  I am looking forward to the next CD!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD was a pleasant surprise.  Schubert is one of my favorites.  I was very excited to learn that the CD includes all the songs I love in the original format.  I was not disappointed at all.  The recording is very good and the performance is excellent.  The CD is worth the price.

Amazon review: I'm not a "Schubert fan" per se, but I do love this CD.  It includes all the songs I love in the original format.  I listened to it on my ipod, but I also listened to it in the car and it was a pleasant listen.  Overall, this CD is worth the price.  I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD thinking it would be better than the CD that I had already.  I was disappointed.  I still have the original CD, but I am not happy with this CD.  The performance is terrible.  The song is just a cover of the song with a different vocalist.  I can't believe I spent $10 on this.  The performance on this CD is horrible.  I don't think this CD is worth the money.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This band is very well-known in the Richmond area.  They are more than just a band, they are a family.  My father played with them on a couple of occasions and told me that if he wasn't so busy, he would come into the band to play with them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: A great record of music from the 20th century (1940-1949).  Some of the tracks are a little too long, but the musicianship is excellent on the whole.  I love the sound of the electric piano in this recording.  I have been told that this is the best way to experience the music of The Four Freshmen.  I plan to get them for my next trip to Europe.  I hope this is the case.  I have yet to have the opportunity to experience the music of The Four Freshmen in the flesh.  I am still waiting for the opportunity to attend any one of their concerts.  This is a very good record.  The sound is excellent, especially the electric piano.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the music of The Four Freshmen.  I am waiting for the opportunity to get a copy of the album.  I have not been able to find another copy of this album.  You may be able to find a copy of it in a used record store.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I haven't been a fan of Michael Jackson since the first album I heard. I have always been a fan of his music, but I haven't been able to get into his videos for a very long time, I just wasn't able to get into his music. I have to admit, I was really surprised when I listened to this album for the first time, as I was trying to find the meaning behind the music. I think it is one of the greatest albums of all time! This is a must have for any Michael Jackson fan.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Michael Jackson since his days as a boy. I have been a huge fan since he released his first album. This is one of his best albums.

Amazon review: This is one of the best Michael Jackson albums. I have never had music more uplifting or more inspirational. This is the type of music that I listen to when I am down and I just need a little boost of the music I love to dance to. This is a very good album that I have listened to many times. I have been a fan since I was young and I am glad that I got to listen to this and know that he is still as great as he was when I was young.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The only time I listen to Michael Jackson's music is when I just want something to dance to. I don't like his new album (the Michael Jackson 5th) is not that great. I like the songs on this album but the songs seem to repeat themselves so much. The songs are all good but the songs just repeat over and over again. I really don't like the new album. I think Michael Jackson is a very talented artist. I don't think I would like another album by him.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I guess you need to buy the cd to hear the song, but you do not need to buy the cd to hear the song. Its a little too quiet. The guitar sounds like it is a little too loud for the song. Its a great song, but just not a good cd. I would like to give this album 3 stars but only because the price was right and the music was great.

The harmonies on "Ain't No Rest for The Wicked" are nice, but nothing stands out to me.  "All in Love Is Not Lost" is sweet, but it has a very slow tempo that doesn't really suit the rest of the album.  "The Best of the Best" is a great song, but "You've Got a Way" comes in at the end of the album.  "Wondering" is a nice intro to the album, but it does not stand out as a song.  "You've Got a Way" is a great song and is a nice addition to the album.  The harmonies on "Ain't No Rest For The Wicked" are nice, but nothing stands out to me.  I do wish this album had more songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review:  This album is a bit of a challenge for the average listener. It is very different from all other CD releases in that it is almost exclusively written in the key of G Minor (which is a minor key).

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I haven't been a fan of Smooth Jazz for a long time,  but when I heard this CD I knew I had to give it a try.  When I first heard it, I thought it was  a little bit of a joke...now  it's my favorite CD of the year.  It is just a wonderful,  very smooth mixture of music...I love it!
