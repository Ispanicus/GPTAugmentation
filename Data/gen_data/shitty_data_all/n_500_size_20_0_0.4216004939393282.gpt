Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: I just don't get the hype about 50 Cent. I listened to this, and I think he is a, excuse the pun, two-bit talent.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it is a good song, and the song with the lyrics is one of my favorites of theirs. It is a little hard to hear the lyrics on the radio though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this song for almost an hour now and I love it. The lyrics are amazing, the melody is great, and I love the chorus. It's really, really good. But I do think that it would have been better if they started the song with a different chord progression so that it sounded different. The chords sound like they are trying to make the song more electronic which is not what the song is about. It's about a man who makes a mistake and then has to go back and fix it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song starts with a great chorus that has a very, very powerful melody. The chorus is very strong and it is really easy to listen to. The only thing I would say about this song is that it seems like the production might be a little too dark for someone who is just starting to listen to metal. But I am sure that will change by the time the album comes out.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a big fan of AFI, and I've been listening to their albums since I was a little girl.  I own all of their albums, and I have been listening to them in my car, in my office, and even in my house.  AFI has done a lot of their best work for me.  This song is one of the best that I have heard from them.  I love it.  I think AFI is one of the best bands in the world.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to agree with some of the other reviews, it's just not a very good song.  I could be wrong, but it just doesn't seem to be written well.  I like the song, but I wish it were a bit better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is a very nice song.  I am a huge fan of AFI and I love this song.  It's a very good song, but I would say a little on the too busy side for my tastes.  It seems to me that the music industry seems to be moving away from the kind of raw, loud and fast metal that AFI are known for, and that is a shame.  I loved the song, but it just doesn't seem to be my kind of music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song, and I would put this on the list of my favorite AFI songs.  I really enjoy this song, and I think it's a very good song.  It's just a little on the generic side and it could use a little more soul and a little more emotion to it.  It just doesn't really seem to flow like it should in my opinion, but I'm not a huge fan of AFI anyway, so that's why I didn't give it a very high rating.  I will say that it's a great song regardless.  It's a good song, and it makes me smile.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've heard this song several times in my car driving to work and it's great.  It's got a great, catchy tune and it has quite a unique sound. I also love the song's chorus.  It's got a very strong melody and it has a great hook. I love the song, and I think it's a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love metal and I love AFI, so it's not so surprising that this song is my favorite of theirs.  The song is actually a little repetitive and I don't think it's very good, but it's still a nice song.  I like the sound of it, but I can't say I'm a big fan of it.  I do think that there is a little bit of a repetitive sound to the song, but I don't think it's that bad.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

The  Lyrics

Amazon Review (1 of 2): If I had to choose one single lyric from this album to use as a metaphor, it would be "Wake up and smell the roses" from the song "I'll Be There for You" by the Monkees. The other lyric is "I've never met a man that I want to go to sleep with" from the song "No Regrets" by the Monkees.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This album is good! I like the fact that the songs are not repetitive and are arranged in a way the audience can hear it on the band's instruments. It shows how the bands sound. I like the fact that it's a different style that the band plays and not just marching band music. I like the variety of the songs. I really like the songs "Forsyth Park" and "Marching Band March". I like the way the songs are arranged. The only thing I don't like is the fact that they are not a lot of them. It would have been so much better with a lot more. I like the style of the band. It's not just marching bands with a marching band. It's also a variety of different styles. I would say the songs are good quality.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: This is a very good album. It might not be for everyone, but it is a good listen. I think many people are going to enjoy this album. I love the music, but I am not that huge of a fan of The Beatles. I do love Pink Floyd. I am a huge fan of Bob Marley, and have only heard him once, but I think he is great. I think this album is much better than The Dark Side of the Moon. I do like the new songs on this album, but there's nothing like the Beatles original stuff. Bob Marley is on there, but I'm a big Beatles fan too. I don't really understand people who say they hate The Beatles. I don't hate The Beatles, but I would much prefer to listen to music like The Beatles. I don't understand how people can say The Beatles are better than the Beatles. I would rather listen to The Beatles than Pink Floyd. I love Pink Floyd, but they are not better than The Beatles. And I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the lyrics. It's just silly. I liked all the Beatles stuff. I love the music, but the lyrics are just silly. I mean, the first song on the album is written by Roger. He wrote the lyrics to the song, and the chorus of the song is a song that Roger wrote and sang. It's just silly. I like the music, but the lyrics are just silly. It's just silly. I'm really glad this album is out, but it just doesn't live up to the Beatles original stuff. There is just so much filler on this record. I think if I had to choose one record to buy, this is the one I would choose. If it were the last album I ever bought, this would be it.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

"Jesus" is a good song, and "Prayer" is another good one.  "I Need Jesus" is a good song, and "I Don't Care" is a good song.  "When I See You" is not a good song, and "I Don't Want to Be" is not a good song.  "I'm Still Waiting" is a good song, and "Prayer" is another one that's pretty good.

Mozart's Requiem massed a great big choir, and the soloists seemed to be in a state of utter disarray.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I'm very sorry, but if you listen to these songs you will find that they sound terrible!  Seriously, I mean really, how can these songs be played?  It literally makes no sense.  The songs are also very repetitive, the lyrics are very cliche.  I cannot believe that I will be spending money on these crappy songs.  If you don't have the nerve to listen to the songs that you know are bad then don't buy the CD!  If you have a CD player then I don't want you to waste your money.  This is a terrible waste of time.

Amazon review: This is a really good CD.  It's not a very long one it has a lot of different styles and songs.  If you like rap then this is the CD for you.  All of the songs are very good.  I am surprised that they had the money to put all the songs on a CD because it would take a long time to write them all.  All 5 songs are great.  I wish that they had a CD of just the good songs.  This CD is worth it.  I would have bought a 7" if I could have gotten that one for free.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I first heard about this album on the internet.  I had seen the song on the net, but never heard it.  I was amazed at the quality of it.

Amazon review: This is worth buying.  I'm not sure what caused me to give this CD a 4.5 stars.  I'm not sure if it's the production or the length.  I will say this CD has a very good production and music.  I will use this album to introduce my children to rap.  I love this CD.

Amazon review: I was given this record to give to my daughter.  I was very impressed that the record was even made.  I got it free.  I am very glad that I bought this record.  It is a great way to introduce kids to rap because it is not too long or complicated.  I have already played this CD to my daughter and my kids love it.  I give it 4.5 stars because it is a short album.  I don't think I would buy it again.  It is very good.

Amazon review: I had heard about this album on the internet, and was very surprised that it was even made.  I was not expecting to like this album at all.  I can tell by the fact that I didn't like the last album that I had listened to that I didn't like these songs very much.  I think that these songs are good, but I think that the music is a little too loud for my taste.  The lyrics are great at the same time.  I will buy this CD.  I think that the music is way over the top, with the rap music being so loud.  I will not buy this CD again.  The lyrics are great, but too loud to my taste.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Holosync for almost a year now and have been using it for 1-2 hours each day. I use the app and the whole day it's been great. I have my phone at the ready, but it's not so good for me to have to listen to a full 20 minutes of a song every time I want to hear it. The app is good, it's just the music that is not. You can't put headphones on because it's a cell phone and you have to get your phone out of the way. It just doesn't feel like a good idea to me. If you want a good app, that's great. I just don't get it.

Amazon review: I love to listen to Jim Gaffigan, but I have to say that this CD is one of his worst ever. I really didn't feel that the CD was worth the money. There are so many terrible songs that are just filler. I think the worst song on this CD is the first one. This is his best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: To start off, I must say that Jim Gaffigan is an interesting artist. The CD starts off with a nice guitar-based intro song, and then the first song is a ballad. I was just about to purchase the cd when I realized that the music was "blah". I am not a fan of ballads. I'm a fan of rock, and I love the song, but I was just about ready to purchase this CD when the vocals started. I knew that this album was not going to be anything but an ear worm. The next song is a song that is probably the worst song on the CD. It's a rock ballad. The lyrics are just a mess. The next song is another ballad, so I skipped it. I was starting to get concerned that I would be wasting my money on this CD. The next song is another rock ballad. The lyrics are just a mess. They are not bad, but they are not very good either. Then it gets worse. The next song is a song that sounds like it was recorded at a wedding. It's about a guy and a girl that aren't together. I don't know if this is a love song or a breakup song, but whatever the case is, it's terrible. The song ends with a song that is just a bunch of random lyrics. I can't even understand half of what the lyrics are saying. The songs are just a mess. The next song is a song that is supposed to be about a guy who is on a business trip and he's in a strange city and he has to find a place to stay. He finds a nice place to stay and he finds a bed that he thinks is nice, but he's not sure. The next song is a love song, but it's about a guy who is a bad lover. I don't remember all the lyrics, but the song ends with the line "I'm sorry for everything I did". I don't remember any more of the lyrics. I have to say that the music is fine. It's not that great, but it's not horrible either. The next song is a song about a guy who is sad because his girlfriend broke up with him. I don't remember any more of the lyrics, but the song ends with the line "I'm sorry I couldn't give you what you need". The next song is also about a guy who is sad because his girlfriend broke up with him. Again, I don't remember any more of the lyrics, but the song ends by telling him to "go to church". The next song is about a singer and his girlfriend. The first verse starts off with the line "I don't know why I'm so alone". This is followed by a song about a woman that is just a mess. She is very confused about her life. When she goes to the store, she has to go to

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review: I have trouble keeping this CD on.  The singing is dreadful. Her voice is horrible.  It sounds like she is calling the devil.  My kids leave when it is on.  I can not recommend this CD, it's just not good.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
