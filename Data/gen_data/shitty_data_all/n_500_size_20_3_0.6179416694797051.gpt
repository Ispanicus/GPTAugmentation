Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album, it's so different from anything I've heard. I was expecting something that would be really heavy, yet with a sound that would be able to hold up against any other artist. I guess that's something to expect from Dre, but this is just a mess. The only tracks that are worth hearing are the two from the first album, and one of the songs from the second. The rest of the album sounds like garbage that I would never want to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the worst album they've put in their catalog for a very long time.  They have made so many "hit" albums like this that they think there's no way to go wrong.  I'm really upset with the quality of the tracks, they all sound like they're being played at a very slow pace.  This album is just a waste of time and money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to say, I really hate this album. It's so good until about the 5th song, then it gets annoying.  The best song is the one that has the worst wordplay.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I love this movie! The theme song from the movie is a classic and the only thing I hated was the music used. It's the same music used in the first movie! It just doesn't add anything.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This release includes one song, as well as a B-side. It was a pretty decent effort at the time, but over time it has really lost its way to the point where it doesn't even sound like the same band anymore. Its really hard to say that this isn't actually a Young Noah album, but it really seems like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the same Young Noah that released a few years back, but this time around they added a different member. Their sound has never really been a big deal to me, but I thought I was missing out on something when I saw this, as it was just an acoustic version of the entire "Destroyer" album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band is just as good as I thought they would be. I have very high expectations for this album, as they are among the best metalcore bands out there right now. I'm sure they will get better over time, but for now, this is a really solid effort and can definitely be an album to look out for in the near future.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I really love the band and the songs.  The only problem is that this is a 2 part thing.  After listening to the first part, I felt the need to listen to the second part and felt the same way.  The second part wasn't half as good as the first.  The first half is good.  I guess that's why it is a 2 part thing.  I'll give it a 3 out of 5.

All original.

"The Best of the 80's" by Steely Dan was released on November 1, 1985. It was released as a double album of 8 discs. The first disc contained 7 songs by the band and the remaining disc contained 13 songs by the band. The album was released with a running time of approximately 70 minutes and a price of $12.98.

This is the best compilation album I have listened to. The most amazing album in my opinion. The most amazing album in my opinion. I love the music and the band. I love the songs. I love it all. But I can't seem to find any negative reviews for it.

I'm really loving this album. The first song, "I'd Rather Be High", is so beautiful and has a really unique sound. I can't seem to find any negative reviews for it. Great album!

I'm a HUGE fan of Steely Dan, and I've listened to this album several times. It's just so beautiful. "I'd Rather Be High" is just breathtaking. I can't seem to find any negative reviews for it. It's one of the most beautiful songs ever written.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

I agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were different and this was not a period piece. The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing music to the upper crust. If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original

I have to say, even though it was a little bit hard to read, I really loved it. I was thinking maybe I should change my school library to the school library. I think I will.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I've never bought anything by TSO before, but I had no idea what to expect with this one.  I was pretty excited, because I have read that this is their best work.  I was also excited because when I put the band on my MP3 player, it was the first time I could hear it.  I was surprised that it wasn't the same as the CD, as I expected it to sound very similar.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

P.S.

I've been listening to this album for about two years now. I originally bought it back in 2006, but I didn't post a review due to lack of time. Now that I've had some free time, I'll start posting a review. It's a good album, but not the greatest.

A lot of bands have been saying that this is their last album, while other bands are saying that they have a new album coming out. Well, the band is still going strong. They have a new album coming out in July 2013, so they will soon be able to tell us.

However, this is a very good album that doesn't need to be written about. It's enjoyable to listen to right out of the gate, and then you can get into the songs that take you further and further.

If you like heavy metal or if you're into some variety, give this album a download. It has everything I would want in an album: good atmosphere, good music, and good lyrics. It's a great start to a solid album, and this is a very good album that will be talked about for a while.

On the songs themselves, it's a solid album that doesn't need to be written about. It's good, solid music that anyone would enjoy. This may have been the most obvious thing about this album, but you have to give the band credit for putting a name to the song.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
