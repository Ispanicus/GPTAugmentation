Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon: I bought this CD because I love the melody and the story that it tells.  But the song is very, very repetitive.  Very boring.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

"This is a solid album"

I have been listening to all kinds of blues albums lately, and this one is one of the most enjoyable of them all. The production is a little rough at times, but the musicianship is great. The songs are well written and memorable, and the musicianship on this CD is fantastic. The musicianship of this band is amazing, the harmonies on this CD are fantastic, and the musicianship and singing is great. I've had a lot of blues music over the years, and this is my favorite of them all.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the way this song is written.  It's very short, but the message is really powerful.  And it's very well-written.  Although, I don't like the ending.  It's just too much like an ice cream cone and not enough like a diamond.  But it's still a good message.  I gave it 2 stars, because it was just a little too short.  But that was my personal opinion.  I know the song is about the diamond.

I like your review.  I agree with you, but I can't understand why you don't like the ending.  They just had to explain the ending.  It was just a little too short.  I like the song, I just wish it had more!  I hope you like this song.  It is my personal favorite.  Here is my personal website http://www.thediamondjourney.com/

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I find it very hard to listen to this album because every song is so completely different. The first song I heard was "Glorified." I don't know why I thought that was a good song, but maybe it was. I just can't help but think it's one of the best songs of Eminem's career. The album is also very different from the other Eminem albums. I love the lyrics but hate the singing.

Amazon review: I was really hoping to hear something that was just a little different from the "typical" rock and roll that we have been hearing for the past 10 years, and this was not it.  I thought that it would be a little bit of a "weird" type of record.  However, after listening to the songs I realize that this is not really a "weird" record.  The songs are not overproduced.  They are great.  My favorite song is The End, and I do wish that there was a little more substance in the music.  I will continue to listen to the other songs that I have on my iPod.  Good job guys!

The songs that I have heard sound good, but the ones that I haven't heard yet I am going to have to go out and purchase.  I have heard so many great songs from artists like the Beatles, The Who, and so on that I have to say that I will have to pick up a copy of this album.  I do like the songs that I have heard so far, and I think that if the songs that I have not heard yet are good I will be happy to listen to them.

Amazon review: I had to get the CD because I am a fan of the band and wanted to hear what it sounded like. It is great, but I have to say that I was really excited about this album. I actually had high hopes for it when I first heard it. I really enjoyed the first song, but after that, it just seemed like the same band with a different gimmick. After listening to this CD, it just seems like the same old music. If you want the new music, please get the other band's new music because this is not the new music from the old band. This is just more mainstream stuff. The only songs that stand out to me are the last few songs on the album, which are just amazing. I would recommend you get the other new band's music because this is just a repeat of their previous music.

Amazon review: I've had this album for about a year now and I'm still very happy with it. I have to agree with the others, this is one of the most boring album's I've ever heard. The songs on here sound like they were recorded with a tape recorder. I can't even believe I'm giving this album a 4 stars because of the fact that this is just one big boring album. I would not even play this one to my friend because they would think I was stupid for giving it a 4 stars. They would think I was stupid for giving this album a 4 stars.

Amazon review: This is a great album. The songs are original and I really like them. The only negative I can find is the song "It's Only Rock 'N Roll (And the Outsiders Are a Lot Worse)."

This is a great song and I think the band should have made it into a full length album.

Amazon review: I just received my CD's this week, and have been listening to them one at a time.  I like them but have two complaints.  First, the lyrics are not as good as some of the other CDs I have listened to.  I could do without the "I don't know, but it sounds like you're saying something, so I'll try to explain it."  Second, most of the music is not as good as the music in the other discs.

Amazon review: I bought this CD in January and am enjoying it. I have had it for about an hour. It is not a true smooth jazz, but sounds like smooth jazz at times. I have listened to the CD a few times and have decided to buy some more of the CD. It has a good variety of songs, but the vocals are not top notch. I thought they were good, but there is not much I can say other than that the vocals are not that great. I like the different instrumentation, but it takes away from the smooth jazz feel. I'm a bit disappointed that it's not smooth jazz, but I guess that's why they call it "smooth jazz". I'm still enjoying it. I think this CD has a lot of great songs.

Amazon review: I had this album for a while, but finally decided to put it on and listen to it.  I guess, it is a little dated.  I have yet to listen to a CD I like that is so dated, but there is something about this CD that I do like.  I do not like the album, because the music is not as good as the music I hear on the radio.  I do like that it starts with a slow song, but the music never goes up and to the end of the song.  I do like that the music for the first three or so songs are not the same song, but change from song to song.  This is also a CD I would have enjoyed as a student in college.

Amazon review: I was looking for a CD to listen to on a weekend when I was alone, and I found this CD.  I got it just to hear the smooth jazz music.  I have been listening to it as I sit here, and then I get lonely and have a cigarette.  I really like the first song on this CD, but I would think that there are more songs that have good music.  I'm not a fan.  I do like the sound of the CD.  I think the CD sounds like an album from the late 80s or early 90s.  I do like this CD because it is different from the stuff I listen to on the radio.

Amazon review: I like the idea of the CD, but I think it is a bit overhyped.  I don't understand why people would want to pay $20 to listen to this music.  I have not listened to it long enough, but I will give it time to play.  The music is really different from what I usually hear.  I think it would be more interesting if the music were slower, and the band would use different instruments.  I do enjoy the music, but I don't think I will buy the CD.  My brother likes the album and plays the CD, but I don't think he will buy the CD.  I would like to hear more than one song on the CD.  I don't think it would be worth $20.  It is just a CD, and I think the music sounds good.  I'm not sure why a CD of music that sounds like "smooth jazz" is worth $20.

So in the end, the songs are just like each other, and the same four chords over and over again, which is a real turn-off to me.  As a bonus, some of the songs on this CD are in the style of the 1920-30's swing era, which I'm really into.  But even these songs are so boring, I don't know how you would listen to them.  They are all just exactly the same four chords over and over again.

Amazon review: I listen a lot to music, and I love it.  I have a CD of songs I listen to all the time.  I like the music on this CD.  But the songs on this CD are not on any of the CDs I listen to all the time.  The songs are different from what I listen to.  I can't get the songs into my head.  They just don't fit.

Amazon review: I love listening to music.  I am actually a fan of music, at.  But after listening to this CD, I am not sure if I am a fan or not.  The songs are all the same songs.  They are all four-chord tunes.  And those four chords keep repeating themselves, over and over again.  The songs seem to be sung in a silly manner, and I am not a fan of silly to be honest.  But there are some good songs on this CD, but I don't think they are going to be to my liking.  They are just too repetitive.  I love the music on this CD, but it is just too repetitive.  I don't know why people like this CD.  I don't know what I'm going to do with it.  I don't know what's going to happen to it.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

"This is what I believe is possible. I believe God can heal and give healing to the sick. I believe in miracles. I believe in the power of prayer. I believe in miracles."
- Dr. James Dobson

It was time for a new CD.  This CD was to be about my spiritual life.  I was trying to write a song about my spiritual life.  I went to youtube and listened to a lot of songs.  My song, "Healing Prayer" was one of the songs.  I had never heard of Dr. James Dobson.  I really enjoyed his writings and his books.  He is a very nice man.  I decided to listen to some of his interviews and read some of his books.  He is very convincing.  I was sure I would fall for his stories.  He is very convincing and very convincing.  I watched a lot of his videos.  I watched the first video where he was interviewed on "The Oprah Winfrey Show".  Oprah is a very nice and very nice lady. She never fails to make me feel very special.  I watched many videos on Oprah.  The next video was about his book "You Can Heal Your Life" and the last video was about his book "100 Mind-Blowing Facts About God".  I really liked Oprah,  I liked the book You Can Heal Your Life and the book, 100 Mind Blowing Facts About God.  I liked the fact that he showed the miracles that happen in the life of a Christian and in the life of a Christian.  These miracles and the miracles that happen in the life of others.  I really liked Oprah and I really liked Dr. Dobson.  I never thought I would find a man that was so good in so many ways.  I really enjoyed Oprah,  I enjoyed Dr. James Dobson.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.
