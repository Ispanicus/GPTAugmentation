Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This CD is good, but I don't recommend it.  Very overproduced.  Some of the songs are great.  I do however love the album "The New Age".  I listen to it everyday.  It is a great album to listen to.  The song "Forgotten Love" is wonderful.  The song "The New Age" is one of my favorites.  Not as good as the album "The New Age".  I like the sound of the album more.  I like the songs on it more.  I prefer the CD "The New Age".  I don't like the CD "The New Age".  I don't have to buy the CD "The New Age".  I can listen to the songs from the album "The New Age" on my CD player.  I don't need to buy the CD "The New Age".  I am glad I bought the CD "The New Age".  I will buy the CD "The New Age" again and again.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is not so different from their last two (which is to say, not so long ago). I think the vocals are somewhat stronger and the music somewhat more consistent. It is a decent album and it shows that the band is continuing to grow. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes 90's hip hop.  If you are a hip hop fan then you are going to like this one.  I don't give a damn about Madrox though and I don't want to hear any more rap.  I will say that if you feel like you have heard it all before then this is probably a good album.  Still, it is a decent album from a "new" group.  I give it an 8 rating out of 10.

Amazon review: I think that the songs on this album have been a little overrated. I do like most of the songs from it. I don't think that it is the best album that they have released but it is a decent album.  I give this album a 7 out of 10.

This album is very short and I don't even think it has anything in it. I don't mind hearing this album that much. This album is an eight out of ten.

Our Reviews

I love my wife and dog, but I have one concern: she likes to shop and I know I'm supposed to say "no" to most things that are out of my budget, but I don't think I could live without her clothes and shoes. She's very picky about what she wants, and I don't mean to be mean--because she is very picky about most things, but she's the most wonderful person I've ever met. I'm a very poor man, and I know I probably shouldn't say that, but I'm being honest.

I've been listening to this album for a couple of years now, and this is the first album that I've ever enjoyed. I really like the song "All Night Long" and I think it would be a great song to wear out a little, because it's slow and it has a lot of positive thoughts. The song "Piano Key" is very good, too, and that song is very popular with my wife. I think that song is great, and I think that song would sound great on a TV or a radio. The song "Lonely Tonight" is kind of a good song that I like. The song "Shake 'Em On Down" is a good song, but the song "Wish You Were Here" is a very good song to me. I really like the song "Come Into My Bed", "Lonely Tonight" is a good song, and the song "Gotta Be (Stronger Now)" is very good. I like the song "We Could Be" very much. I like all the songs on this album very much. I really like "All Night Long".

I like the album because I like "All Night Long" because it has a lot of positive feelings and I like "Come Into My Bed" because it has a great song. I don't like the song "Lonely Tonight" because it doesn't sound like the music that I like. The song has a lot of good feelings and it's just a good song.

I like the album because I really like all the songs on it. I

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was an active member of the Jazz group at the University of Michigan for ten years. Although my grades were good, my music knowledge was poor. I didn't understand that the key to becoming a great jazz musician is to go to school to learn how to listen. I took a lot of classes--not only the basic classes but the advanced classes that allowed me to study beyond the standard jazz curriculum. I also took classes that provided me with the background and tools to become a musician. I'm grateful I had the opportunity to study jazz in the first place.  A student of mine who is a jazz pianist is also a jazz student.  He is a great musician, but he doesn't understand why jazz musicians are perceived as pretenders when they have an education. This is the way it should be.   I believe in the music of my ancestors.  I think there are still people in this world who have not lost the feeling for the music of the past. I think that the music of the past is all around us. I have studied and taught in the university of Michigan, the University of Chicago, and the University of Detroit.  I have also spent a good many years studying and playing jazz in Europe, the Caribbean, the United States, and Africa.  I have learned a lot from all of my teachers and from the students I have taught.  I have come to the conclusion that the most important thing a jazz musician can do is to understand the music he plays.  I believe that the more you understand the music, and the more you play the music, the more your music is valuable to the world.  There is no substitute for knowing the music you play.  I have read other jazz reviews and have found that the most important thing to a jazz musician is to understand the music he plays.

Amazon review: I own this CD for a long time, and I have always enjoyed the music. It really is a great CD. It is not that "easy", like your review says. It involves listening to the songs...really getting the music to come out...which is the hardest part of it...but it is a very rewarding experience. I am not a huge fan of smooth jazz, and I never will be, but this CD is a great addition to my collection. My only criticism is that the CD could use some editing. The CD has some great songs on it, but they are not the best.  The CD is more than just the music...it is a great compilation of some great musicians, and one of the best CDs I have ever bought. I love this CD.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because it was the only one that came with the CDs I had to listen to. I was amazed at the musicians that recorded it. I also liked the fact that the album is really a compilation of the artists who performed on the album. I think that the CD would have been even better without these artists, because they are just not that great to me. The CD is a compilation of several styles of music, and it is very well done. I think it is a great CD, and I would highly recommend it to other people.  I also think that it is a great CD to have in the trunk of your car. I guess it is a very good CD, but I would have liked to have heard some of the artists who have participated in the CD that are not on the album.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of music, but unfortunately, the musicians seem to be all from the 70s and are all too old.

I am a big fan of the music of the 60s and 70s and this CD is terrible.

I really like it.  I don't feel like the songs are great, but I like the ones that are.  Meghan Trainor does a great job singing and writing.  I can't believe how great she is.  She really is that talented.

Amazon review: I was extremely disappointed in this album at first.  I was so happy when I found out she is a singer and will be releasing new songs.  I thought this would be the best Meghan Trainor album, but I was wrong.  I didn't like any songs.  I thought she was going to release a good album, but to me it just wasn't good.  I am going to give this album 3 stars.  I'll have to listen to the next one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has the same songs as all her other albums.  It's like she never stops.  All the songs just keep coming out and I keep buying them.  I love her songs and I'm glad to have her in the music business.  She sings well and she can write songs too.  I'm really excited.  I want to see her move out of the pop industry and into the country singer industry.  I think she's going to do great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is boring.  I want more.  Meghan Trainor sings well, but she just repeats her songs all over again.  I don't know why she doesn't make new songs.  I like the songs on this album, but I wish she would make more new songs.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is a great singer.  I don't know what people are talking about when they say she's not a good singer.  She's really good.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This CD is a compilation of many other recordings. The only thing I could compare it to is a CD of the original music for "Romeo & Juliet" with the cast recording of the play. The voices are different, but the music is basically the same as well as the story. I don't think the "Romeo & Juliet" CD is worth the price of the entire collection, but I'll have to give this CD a listen. I've heard other versions at other venues, but I've never seen or heard a recording like this before. A gem in the bargain bin.

Amazon review: If you are looking for a nice, easy, inexpensive, easy to assemble and assemble quickly CD of popular songs I would recommend this. The songs are not "classics" or "classical" or even "pop" so you can't expect to like every track. It's not too difficult to assemble, but it takes a little bit of time. It is all pretty standard, but it was fun to listen to.

I watched this with my daughter. I've listened to a few of her songs before, but I think she's the best singer in the world! I feel like she's not doing much right now, but I will continue to listen to her as I am still a big fan!

I loved it. It was very interesting. I didn't like the fact that she was singing with her mouth covered. As a matter of fact, I don't like singing with my mouth covered. I like to be able to breathe. I have a terrible voice and a bad habit of singing to myself. I don't think she did anything wrong, I just think it was a bad idea. In some cases it is bad that you are singing with your mouth covered. I like when I can sing my voice out and the rest of the world can hear me.

I'm not too sure about it. I thought it was a very good song, but I think it was more annoying than anything else. And to be honest I have trouble with the singing style. It's very unnatural, but in this case, I thought the voice was very, very good.

I like Meghan Trainor. I think she is very talented. I would like to hear more from her. I don't know why she is not doing more pop and ballad. She should do more of that. The song is okay. I found the lyrics to be a little repetitive. There is a lot of singing but it is not annoying or repetitive. I liked the video, but I think she could have done more. I

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album, I did, and I really liked it.  The first song started off really good, but then the album went downhill.  I liked the first song on the album, but the rest are just repetitive, boring, and just not very good.  I could have done without the last song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  It's probably the best I've heard from Twiztid since their debut album.  I didn't think it was as good as the debut, but it is a decent album by a decent rapper/rapper.  Not a bad album, but not a great one.  I have listened to other rapper albums by Twiztid, and I have never been disappointed.  This is the best to date, but I will probably not be buying any more Twiztid albums.  Not to say there aren't any good ones out there (I'm sure there are) but Twiztid is not on my level.

Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of this album. I thought it was really good, but just didn't feel like it was as good as the other 2 albums I have heard.  It also had some very bad tracks on it.  I can only listen to the good songs so far.

I would recommend buying the new album. Or any other other artist.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was by far the worst album I have listened to by Twiztid.  I have listened to Twiztid, Big Tymers, and Lil' Fame all albums.  This album was so bad it was just a waste of time.  I have listened to a lot of hip hop and R&B, and this was the worst album I have ever listened to.  It seems like Twiztid doesn't know what he is doing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really love Twiztid's music.  I think that Twiztid is one of the best rappers in the game today.  I love the fact that he talks about real things in his songs.  I really, really want to listen to his new album, but I just don't.  This album is just a waste of time.  There are a few songs I like, but I don't want to listen to this album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album 3 times, and it was just a waste of time.  I've noticed that Twiztid has become a little repetitive, and this album is no different.  It makes me want to go back to what I know I like.  I could definitely see this album being on my iPod.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoy the music that Twiztid puts out.  I enjoy the fact that he is so well-rounded.  He just seems to bring out different lyrics from different artists that I like.  He is also very creative with his beats.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: When this album came out, I was in high school and had just gotten out of the band I'd been in for years. I remember sitting in a room, alone, for hours and hours, trying to write songs. The first few times I tried, I couldn't do it, even though I was just trying to write the songs that I thought were cool. Then, I started writing songs when I was in college and I would have to go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 1am to write more songs. Then, I got into the band and it took 5 years to produce the album and tour and we did 2 tours. I still play the songs I wrote when I was in the band at the moment (and I'm not sure if they fit the new album) and the songs I wrote when I was in high school. The album is a mix of all of my favorite songs, however, I just don't love it. The songs are not as memorable as the songs I wrote when I was in the band. I would listen to it for a few minutes and then go play the songs that I wrote in high school and remember why I wrote them in the first place. But, I like the songs I wrote in high school better, so I ended up buying the album. When I first heard the album, I thought that it was a mix between the two because I didn't know that I had written a lot of songs in high school. I think that the album has a lot of songs that could have been a mix of both. But, since I didn't know that I had written a lot of songs in highschool, I didn't care to listen to them. I don't think that they are a really good album and I would not buy it again.

Amazon review: I bought it recently. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this CD. I was pleased to find many songs that I remembered from my teenage years as well as some that I hadn't. Most of the tracks are songs that we played on the road, but I really liked the album. The songs are well played with great harmonies and are unique. I definitely recommend buying this CD.

Amazon review: I was hoping to find an alternative country compilation to add to my collection. This album is not what I expected. I have never heard of this band before, but their music is great. I enjoyed the songs that I listened to. They are both country and rock/R&B. I am not sure if they will be able to compete with other country compilation albums, but it is a very good addition to my collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great compilation. It's not country by any means and it's much more of a mix of rock and electronic. There are a few tracks that I think I've heard before and others that I haven't. At first I thought that this was going to be a "country" band, but I was surprised. I think that if you like rock and electronic then this will be a good mix for you. The songs are great, I thought it was a great collection.

Amazon review: This CD has a lot of great songs. There are some that I don't think I have ever heard of before. I will have to listen to these songs more when they are released on their own.

This is a great CD for any fan of alternative or rock and roll.

She is so talented that she deserves to be on the Billboard Hot 100, but she doesn't deserve to be on this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Thee Bright Lights for a very long time, and now it's time for me to return the favor. I don't know if it's because of the new album, or because of the new label, or because they are just going back to their roots, or because they are going through some hard times in their lives, or just because they are a bunch of geniuses, but I have to say, Thee Bright Lights is one of the most creative albums I have ever heard. The production is top notch, and, in the case of "Thee Bright Lights," I am almost tempted to call it a masterpiece. Some of the best lyrics are still in the album (and it has a little bit of everything), but the fact that this album has a lot of different styles is what makes it so special. It's music for all walks of life, and it's music that will make you feel alive.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I just got home from the library and found this book on classical guitar.  I was so intrigued by the book, I looked up a few books on classical guitar to see what he had to say about classical guitar, but that's all he had to say!    I was surprised by the number of different songs that he had on the album and I was even more surprised to find a couple of songs that I knew and had never heard!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The entire album has been great, but the last 10 minutes of the album has been a little overbearing.  I'm not sure if this is the fault of the recording or the fault of the artist (or both).  Maybe I will listen to the whole album to see if I like it after all!    If you are a fan of classical guitar, I would recommend picking up a copy of this recording.

At the end of the album the vocalist has another number in the second half of the album which I don't know how to describe.  I would like to say that I would not like to perform this number.  I think it would be very difficult to sing.  This album is very musical, I have enjoyed it.

Amazon review: This is simply one of the best classical albums I have ever heard.  The music is very well done.  There is a little bit of jazz and folk on the album, but I did not find that to be a distraction.  I would recommend this for anyone who isn't a classical music fan.

I wish that this CD would have a CD that contained singing into a microphone.  There is a good chance that if someone was to listen to this CD, they would be able to sing into a microphone.
