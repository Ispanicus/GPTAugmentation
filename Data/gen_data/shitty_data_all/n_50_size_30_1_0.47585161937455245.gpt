Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: First song does not work on my ipod. I have tried with different players, I have tried to play the song on my computer and not my ipod, I have tried to set all the options on my ipod to play this song at full volume, I have tried to play the song on my computer and in the background on my ipod. Nothing works. The only solution is to shut my ipod down and turn it on again. I have tried it several times and the only way I can fix it is to send it back to Amazon and beg for another song.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a feeling these songs will be a little more downbeat in the future.  It's only the second CD in the series.  I feel that the majority of songs are going to be happy and happy songs.  When you have a guy singing about how his ex is cheating on him, what are you supposed to think?  It's a little too much to handle.  I don't know if the CD will continue to be this happy, but I don't see it going down this road.  I like the songs a lot, though.  I'm kind of hoping that the next CD will be a bit more downbeat.  I think the songs on this CD are good. I'm going to be waiting for the next CD to come out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this CD.  I've had a lot of faith in Meghan Trainor's music.  I think she's a really talented songwriter.  She's had some really great songs written for her.  Unfortunately, she seems to be going through a mid life crisis.  I've noticed that her voice seems to change.  She's using a lower tone and it sounds a little less clear.  I really have to wonder where she's going with this.  I really hope that her next CD isn't going to be all happy songs and happy melodies.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think they've come out with a few good songs, but I just can't put more than two or three songs together and listen to them all the way through.  It's a little like being in a car accident and not being able to see what's going on.  I just don't get it.  It's a little predictable.  I don't know what's going on with her.  It just doesn't sound like her anymore.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After listening to this CD, I decided to move on to the next CD that I received.  I have been a fan of the band since I heard the first song on the CD. After a few listens, I have to say that Libera's music has gained a lot of positive response from the Christian community.    The band is talented, well-written and have a very well-rounded sound.  The songs are well-developed and the music is unique, but that doesn't make for a good CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I was very excited to hear this CD and it's been on my iPod for about a weeks now. After listening to Libera's music, I was disappointed.  I like the fact that the songs sound like they just came from their hearts, but the songs on this CD are extremely repetitive and they don't sound like they should be able to sing together.  The lyrics are not very good.  The lyrics make the songs sound very generic.  Some times the song's lyrics are not even related to what the song is about.  The songs on this album are very repetitive.  The songs on this album are very slow.  The way the songs are written, the tempo is very slow and very monotonous.  It doesn't sound as if the band is trying to make any type of new musical statement.  I am not sure it would be worth listening to for a long time.

Amazon review: This CD is the most boring CD I have ever listened to.  The CD is boring and the music is boring,  the songs are boring,  The lyrics are boring and the song's are boring.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: This is the best album on Twiztid so far. It's a great mix of different styles, it's hard to describe the album without giving it away, but I am sure that's what Twiztid want. It's not a bad album, but it's nothing more than a good start.

The songs are poorly written, and not sung in a way that I actually hear.  It's just all over the place.  The lyrics of some songs are horrible and a lot of the lyrics are repetitive.  The album just isn't worth the money, and I will probably just go buy the other albums that are available.

But I can say that the album is worth the money to buy, especially if you are a fan of the whole Twiztid family.  But I was disappointed that the vocals and lyrics are a little bit weak.  I mean, its a cool album but I can't get over the fact that it is just not what I was expecting.  And I am not a fan of them.  I'm too old school.  I'm not a fan of the whole Twiztid family.

Amazon review: This is my first album from Twiztid, but I must say that it's the most well produced album thus far.  It's also very well recorded and well produced.  The vocals are awesome.  The songs are all very good.  This is the most well produced album thus far and is my favorite album by this group.  The vocals of the group are very good.  I love the fact that they are singing about "Jesus" instead of "Jesus."  The only problem is when they sing the songs about Jesus it's not as clean and it sounds like they are doing the songs just for themselves and not for the Jesus.  The lyrics are also very good.  I love the songs that they have on this album.  The first song is the best of all.  It's about how Jesus told his disciples how to live, and what they can do to help those who are hurting.  And I think that's why it's the most well produced album thus far.  They are all good songs.  The second song is also good.  It's about how Jesus loved his people and how He wanted them to come under His love.  It's a very good song especially if you are a follower of Jesus.  I love it.  The third song is also a good song.  It's about how Jesus gave his life for everyone.  Then it goes on to the next song.  I don't know if I am supposed to like this song or not.  I don't.  But it's a good song.  Then the last song is also a good song.  It's about how Jesus will judge the world because He loves everyone.  He's going to judge the world until the end of time.  And that's what this song is.  It's all about how Jesus loves everyone and how He is going to judge the world until the end of time.  So I don't know.  I don't like this song.  But it's a good song.  Overall, this album is not at all something that I would recommend.  It's nothing special.  It's just a bunch of songs that are written and sung by a bunch of guys who don't know what they are doing.  They are not very good at writing and singing the songs.  If you like the music and want to like the music, then you'll definitely like this album.  But if you want to like it, you'll have to buy the next album.  The first album is not as good as the second one, but it's still better than what this album has.  I am glad I got this album because I'm a fan of the music and lyrics.  I can say that I'm a fan of this album.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the band, Dallas Holm. I've been listening to them since they began in the early '80s. They have some of the best songs on the planet. The best part of their music is the band is led by a bass player who has such a unique sound that you will never find anywhere else. There is also a drummer who plays with such precision that you will never find anywhere else. The guitarist plays with the same precision. There is also a girl named Melissa who is a brilliant singer who can hold a note for hours on end. The song is called "My Kinda Love" and it is a fun song that will make you smile and laugh.

I'm not sure if the difference is just my age, or if there were just a few songs that got a little too much air time.  I enjoyed them, but it would have been better if they had cut back a little.  I just wish they could have played a little faster.  The last song on my list was a bit of a letdown.  They played it pretty well, and I liked it, but it just wasn't all that special.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been a fan of their music for a long while.  I have never been to Richmond,  but I have heard about it and am familiar with the area.  I  was there on the first day of the festival when they played, and the first song I heard was  New Day.  I liked the music, but I felt like the crowd did not.  I was hoping for an opening set from the band, but I guess they had to play what was on the radio.  I don't know if this is something that will happen in the future, but I  was looking forward to seeing these guys play.  I thought they played a great show, and I hope that it happens again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was disappointed with the band's sound.  The vocals were okay, but for some reason, it sounded like they were singing at the same time they were playing.  It was kind of like a high school band, where they played the song in the style of the band's older, more important songs, and then they stopped and picked up the newest, most popular songs.  I think they should have played a bunch of their newer songs, instead of just these 2.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of their music since their early days and the band has had an influence on me and my friends.  I have never seen them play, but I have listened to their music on CD's and MP3's for years.  I liked the band more than I thought I would.  The only thing I didn't like was the sound.  I was expecting more of a rock band, especially with the guitar sound.  I think their sound was fine, but I do not like the sound that they played, and it was not that bad for the band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know what it is with  bands like this, but I am always a little wary of their sound.  They seem to be the type of band that you just want to hear the music, but they don't have a lot of music.  I have never seen these guys play, but I have heard their music on several CDs.  I listened to the first song and liked it very much.  To me, it went from a boring song about a woman who is pregnant to a really fun song about a girl in love and the guy was not around.  I would have liked to hear a song that was more of a rock band.  I have to say that I like the sound of the last song, but I wouldn't mind hearing a song that was more like  a rock song.  I was hoping for a song that was like my teenage dream: a rock song that had a good guitar solo.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this album since the CD was released in 1980 and still love it.  I think it must have been released in 1980, because I bought it for my birthday.  The songs were written by the same composers, but released different albums, so I would get a new album every year.  It was very popular and very well received.  But this album is the best of the lot.  It is not a "pop" album, but it has the same feel and the same emotion as "Carmen" and "Don Giovanni."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This album is a must for any opera lover.  I have never heard of any other musical version of this opera.  And this recording is as good as the original, and better, and more heartfelt, and I am sure it will prove to be one of the most popular and beloved operas ever, like "Carmen" and "Don Giovanni."  It is a beautiful, moving, brilliant piece of music that I have never heard before.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This album does not disappoint.  The three-character opera that was first performed in 1778, "La Traviata," was not written by the composer, Giacomo Puccini, but by Gaetano Donizetti, and therefore had to be based on a true story.  (The opera was first performed at the Teatro Valle in the Venetian city of Padua.)  The story is about a young woman and her lover who fall in love at first sight.  The young woman is called Violetta, and the young man is called Rodolfo.

Amazon review:  This is just a great album, it is all the more better for being in the original format and I was very impressed with the quality of the original mix.  I have heard so much negative stuff on this album, but I am still listening to it and enjoying it.  The "D'Arcy" album was the first time I heard it and I have really enjoyed it.  This album is just as good and I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants a great album to add to their collection.  Now I am going to go back and listen to all the other albums and enjoy them.  I am not sure if I mentioned this or not before, but this is the first time I have bought an album for my husband since we had our son and I am happy that I have bought this album since it is an album that you can listen to and enjoy all the time.  I am sure it will be one of his favorites.  I look forward to the next album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is a nice recording. I think it is nice because the recording is on two CDs. I never really knew who this guy was. I found the music interesting.

Amazon review: I have listened to the albums and have not had a comment. However, since I have not listened to the songs I would like to take a few minutes to explain why. I understand that the songs are not new. However, the songs are not bad. In fact, I would like to see a cover of this song. If I have heard it before, I would like to see it performed. In other words, I would like to hear what I have heard before and how it is done. I do not want to see a cover of the title song. It is a good song, but not a good song to be performed. I have heard the songs on the CD several times. I have also listened to the CD a couple of times. I have heard all the songs. I am not sure why the songs are not well known. However, I have heard the songs from several artists. Why is it that the songs are not well known? I am a fan of this artist. So, I would like to hear these songs performed. I have listened to them twice and I am not sure why they are not known. I would also like to hear the songs performed. I would like to hear them performed. I would like to hear a cover of one of the songs.

Amazon review: I listen to to this entire set before I go on a job interview.  It strangely empowers me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album more than once in my life since I first heard it.  It is probably the best hip-hop album I have ever heard.  He has the ability to make the most obscure references in a song sound amazing.  This album is great for a hip-hop fan.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this album.  I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this garbage.  I won't even bother giving the album an overall description of this being a terrible album.  I won't even bother giving it a rating of 1 star.  It's just a waste of my time and money.  It's just not worth my time and money.  I hope everyone who is looking for a good hip-hop album will look elsewhere.  This album is not worth listening to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was surprised to see that this album has been out for a long time.  At the time I was reading my book and listening to a lot of music, so I went on google to see what they had to say about this album.  I'm guessing it is a good album, but I didn't hear any new stuff on it.  The music was pretty good, but I just don't think it's the best hip-hop album.  I feel that there is a lot of music that is just not hip-hop.  I also feel that the music from rap I listen to is a little too "pop" for me.  I can't get into it.  So, if you don't like rap or hip-hop, this is probably not the album for you.  I would suggest something more in the jazz, blues, or R&B genre.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album is the best rap and hip hop album of all time.  I love every track on this album, and they're all classics.  I wish there was only like 5 or 10 songs on this album.  I love this album more than anything.  This is one of the best albums of all time.

Amazon review: I purchased this album to help my friend out.  She's starting to get into hip-hop and I was really hoping this would help her.  It didn't really help me, though.  The album is really nothing but generic rap/hip-hop songs.  I also didn't think it was worth the money, so I never bothered to download it.  I'm not very hip hop fan, but I do like this album.  This album is better than most other hip-hop albums.  It has a good beat and a good beat is what makes a good hip-hop album.  There are really not a lot of good hip-hop albums out there.  This one has a good beat and is just all kinds of crap.  I would never listen to this album again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big hip-hop fan, but I thought this album was really good.  I like the beat, and most of the songs are good.  I didn't like the majority of songs.  Most of them just sounded the same, and the songs in the middle just sounded like they were trying to imitate other people.  It was a bunch of generic rap/hip-hop songs that just didn't have much to do with one another.  I would listen to this album again if it was good, but I don't think it is.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon (Germany) review: I have listened to the recording, but I prefer the Schubert piano sonatas.  The piano sonatas are more like Schubert.  Schubert is a master of music, and I don't think this is a good track.  I think this is a mediocre song.  I don't think it is the best of Schubert.  I don't think this music is Schubert at all.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: This cd is a perfect example of why most Christians are on the outside looking in.  I have been a Christian since the age of 13 and was an unbeliever in many ways.  However, I have always had a love for singing and am blessed to have a wonderful group of Christian sisters in my church to listen to these cd's with.  This cd made me feel like a better Christian and God's Word was very powerful.  I had the opportunity to see the Holy Spirit move and I felt like I was on a mission and was part of something bigger than myself.
