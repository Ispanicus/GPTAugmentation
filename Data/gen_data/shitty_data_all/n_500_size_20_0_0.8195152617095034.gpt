Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This album is the biggest disappointment I've ever had with an album. I really like their version of "Dumb Blonde" on their album I'm a Believer, and that song is probably one of the best songs of the 80's. This album is a lot of filler, and it doesn't really sound like the original band. I mean, it's good in the sense that it sounds like the original band, but it's not that good. I mean, I like it a lot, but I don't think I would have liked it as much as I did. There are a lot of great songs on this album, but this album is just a lot of filler and not enough of the original songs. There are maybe three or four good songs on this album.

Amazon review: The collection is great but the pressing of the vinyl records is not. I've ordered over 5 collections with different pressing of record and every single time the record turns out to be poor quality. The first set of records I bought back in 2004 was from a factory pressing. I was shocked at first to find my copy of the album was from the same pressing. I then read reviews that found this album was also from the same pressing. When I finally got a response I was told the vinyl was "good" but the record had been pressed in such and "good" way that it would not play correctly. I was then told the records had been pressed again and again by a different company. I tried to contact them so they could correct the record but they either ignored me or never responded. I have since sent a message to the other collections seller that the records were from the same pressing and were still good. I hope this helps. This was one of the few times I've ever returned a record. I'm now out of vinyl and will not be ordering another collection from this seller.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

The first time I heard it, I was a little intimidated, but I was really impressed.  I bought this song for my daughter who is not old enough for me to play with her yet. She will be three in August and I have to tell her about it, but I want to wait until she is a little older.  But I know she will love this song and it will be a nice reminder of her to be happy and to smile.

On Christmas Day, I look forward to the new year with great anticipation. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. This song makes me feel like I am with them, at least for a little while. I love the message of the song. The song is very relaxing and easy to listen to. I listen to it on my way to work and at night when I don't want to get out of bed. I also listen to it in the shower, car, and the living room. It is a great song for when you have a headache or a cold. I also like the song when you are having a bad day. It makes me happy and makes me feel better. I like to listen to music at night while I am sleeping. I also like to listen to music while I am driving. It makes me feel like I am driving by myself and I am at peace. I also like to listen to music while I am driving. It is a very relaxing and calming song. It's a good song to put on when you are having a bad day. The only thing I would change is the lyrics. I would change it to something like "You can't take my happy away." It would make the song more personal and more fitting for a person of any age. But I would still listen to it.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: This is a great album, it's my favorite work of his.  This is the best album in his entire career.  But a lot of the songs are weak, and there's too much of "the band" sound.  I'm not saying that he's on crack, because I know he's not, he's just not the singer I remember.  I still love his voice, but I'm not in love with him anymore.  I wish he'd give it another go.  He's my favorite singer in the world, I don't understand why things are the way they are.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

The album is called, "Mary Martin Sings Cole Porter".  There are five CDs in the package.  The first CD is Cole Porter's "This Year's Woman" and the next CD is "Cotton-Eyed Joe".  The fourth CD is "Let's Face the Music and Dance".  The fifth CD is "Swingin' All Night".  The liner notes are on the first CD cover, and the other CDs have liner notes and CD covers.  The package contains about 20 CDs.  I have already listened to the first CD and I am very happy with how the recording is done.  The recording is not a good one, but it is good enough to make this a good CD.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

It sounds like a bunch of people that are trying to do a cover version of the classic song "Hallelujah" but they are not aware of the actual lyrics and what it means to them.  The sound quality is terrible, and the vocals are so low that they should not be heard at all.  I will not buy this CD.

Amazon review: I have yet to encounter a band that sounds this bad.  I have seen this band play in several different venues in the past few years, and they play really well.  They have a unique sound that they keep changing up on the albums they release.  But, the band has been around for several years now, and they are always on the road, so they are able to play in many different clubs.  I was pretty excited about this album, but the band sounded tired overall and the songs sounded samey.  I have yet to find a song that was not boring or boring at least a little bit.  There was no variety to the songs.  I found the lyrics to be extremely boring.  I wish they were better and more imaginative.  However, the music is pretty good and the album is definitely worth listening to.  The band was not bad, it just sounded awful.  I have heard several other reviewers say the same thing, so I will not bother talking about it.  I am not a fan of this band, they sound boring and they are not very interesting.  I just feel sorry for the people that buy the album.  I haven't decided whether or not I will buy it yet, I will let you know what I decide.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I bought the record, thinking that it would be a collection of my favorite songs, but I found out that the songs are not random, but are the songs from the first album (which I love), and the second album (which I loved too, but they didn't write any of the songs from my first album). The album starts off with 3 songs that have been on my wish list for years, "Time", "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" and "Comfortably Numb." Then, I found out that the first song is actually "Money," about a guy trying to get out of jail. I was so shocked! This is a great cd. I think there is a lot more on other albums, but this is a good place to start.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

I was searching for a song to use in my movie that I got permission from miley cyrus to use in the film. I got in touch with her and told her I would like to use a song out of her new album. She loved the track so much she agreed to let me use it in my movie which I did.

I am not a movie maker, but i love movies, and i would love to make a movie, i love movies and i would love to make a movie about miley cyrus as well as her new album.

The movie i am talking about is called "See You Again"

I really liked this song so much i decided to use it in my movie. it was a really nice song, even if it was just to please her.

If you get a chance, please go to youtube and listen to this song you will not be dissapointed!

I was in the middle of doing a movie that had to do with miley cyrus. i wanted to use her song "the light" in the movie but it was in the movie but it was too long and i had to shorten it. so i decided to use an other song in the movie which is "see you again"

I loved this song so much i wanted to use it in my movie. i really hope it was used in the movie and i love miley cyrus so much i wanted to use her song in my movie so i told her it was good but it was not in the movie.

After thinking of what we could do to make her happy, we decided to make a video of her saying how happy i am that she liked the song. we all then decided to make a video of miley cyrus singing in her apartment. We filmed her singing in her home and she was so happy with the song she decided to give us money for the video.

I just wanted to share this video with the world. i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do.

If you have a chance please go to youtube and listen to this song. i am trying to spread a message of love and peace.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I lost this song from my mp3 album. I noticed it was missing and this was not acceptable to me. This was my first downloaded song from Amazon a few years ago.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I paid for this song so I could attach it to some pictures of my daughter. it wouldn't play the whole thing. I definitely felt ripped off
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm tired of the people that rip off this song so I'm going to show them how it's done. This song is great, though. I think this is the only rap song that goes to the next level. I'm not a rap person, but this song is worth the price of admission
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This sounds like some kind of horrible accident on an airplane. It's the only song on the album that didn't have the whole song, and it seemed like it kept going for a long time. It's an amazing song with a great message.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very odd song. This song is weird. This song really isn't a rap song. It's more of a weird kind of weird song. You can tell that the song writers had a lot of fun with this one, but it doesn't sound like anything other than a weird, bizarre, and very poorly-written song. It's a little bit of a strange little song by a lot of people. It's not on the CD, it's not on iTunes, and it's not on the web. If you're a fan of The Cars, the Who, or anything like that, then this is for you. If you're not a fan of anything similar, then it's not for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of The Who, The Cars, and The Cars' "I'm a Boy." It's probably the only song that has ever made me cry. I love that song's message of "I'm not alone!" and I love that it tells you that no matter how much trouble you have, you're not alone! I know that's true for me. I'm not alone. I'm not the only person going through a tough time. This song is so incredibly powerful and true, and it really just hits me in the heart at how much I really do have a friend in me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song has a lot on it in terms of words. I mean, there are more words in this song than there are in "The Sun Never Sets" by the Beatles. If you like the Beatles, then you'll like this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I hate this song because I never knew it existed! I bought this song off the internet but never knew it was a song. Now, I've heard it and it's one of the best songs on the album. Definitely worth the money spent on it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is not a good song. Not a bad song, but not a good song. This song is just a song with nothing else on it. It's terrible. Now, when I went to buy the album, I felt like it would be a good song, but I feel like it's really just a stupid song. I can't believe I actually bought this album. I feel like I'm buying a car that's on blocks. Just a car with no power. I feel like this album is a waste of money and time. I could have gotten a really good CD of other songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was looking at the album cover when I first heard this song. Now, I think this song is really really good. I feel like this song is very funny and entertaining, and I think it fits very well on the album. I like it very much.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not a good song. I mean, I really liked it, but it's not a good song. I mean, it's not a bad song, but it's not a good song. I mean, it's just not a good song. This song is not a good song. It doesn't make me feel good. I think this song is just a really bad song. I think this song is the worst song ever! I mean, it's not a bad song, it's just a bad song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a good song. It's just a really bad song. Now, when I listened to this song, I started crying. Now, I'm not a fan of the song, but I really really liked it and didn't really want to be a fan of the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.

Amazon review: This was the first CD I bought from this band. After listening to it, I can say they have some very, very good songs. I had a hard time deciding which disc to buy. Their sound is very unique and their message is very moving. They are worth listening to. The artwork is just cool. I suggest you buy their CD even though you haven't heard them yet. I will buy a second CD for my friends and family.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this album, but I am a little disappointed that the only song I wasn't pleased with is "The Secret". The music in this CD is very well written and I was also pleased with the sound, but I'm not sure I will be able to listen to the lyrics that often.
