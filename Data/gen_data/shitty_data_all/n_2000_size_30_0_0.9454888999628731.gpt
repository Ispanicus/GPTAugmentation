Amazon review: Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this was a free download when you install the amazon software. I was trying to figure out why I had purchased this since I have no recollection of doing so, or ever heard of the artist.  Very generic song, no redeeming qualities for me.  Sounds like just about everything else out there.

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

Amazon review: I like this CD.  I like the fact that I can hear the voices of the person who wrote the songs.  Also, the lyrics are in the background which is something I don't always get with "modern" songs.

Amazon review: I bought this CD when it was first released in Japan.  I've had it for a long time, and I've had it for around a month now.  I'm not sure how much longer I'll have it.  I've had it for over a month, and I've had it over a year.  The songs have been on a CD for quite some time now.  The songs have been on a CD for quite some time now and they're still good.  I still enjoy them.  I find myself humming the songs on my own, which is a good sign.

Amazon review: The first time I heard a song, I knew that I'd heard it before.  I knew it was very old and that it had been recorded.  I also knew that it was a song that I would have liked to have been sung by the other Beatles.  I had heard it on the radio once before, but I'd never heard it on a record.  It was very good.  The song is called: "I Won't Stand in the Way".  The second time I heard it, I was amazed at the difference.  I was really surprised at the difference.  I did not think I had ever heard a song like that.  I've never heard that song on a record before, so I was really surprised at the difference.  But it still sounds good and I still like the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is great.  I have it on my CD player all the time now.  I'd say that it's my favorite CD.  The songs are all good, but the songs on this CD are like a soundtrack to a movie.  Everything you hear is like an actor's version of the song.  The song is called "I Won't Stand in the Way".  The other songs on the CD are:  "Sally Cinnamon",  "I Can't Stop Loving You",  "I Don't Want to Know",  "I Don't Want to Know",  "I'll Always Love You",  "Don't Let Me Down",  "I Was Born to Love You",  "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)",  "What a Little Moonlight Can Do",  "I Need You",  "It's All Over Now",  "The Look of Love",  "The Look of Love",  "If I Fall in Love" and "The Look of Love".

Amazon review: I bought this because I knew that it would be good.  It's a compilation of songs.  The songs are really good.  I find it really hard to pick just one song from it and say "that one is my favorite" but the songs on the CD are all good.  I'd say that the first song that I heard on the radio was "Let It Be" and then I heard "Honey Love" and then I started to hear more of the songs on this album.  Now I find that "I Was Born to Love You" and "If I Fall in Love" are my favorites.  I guess it does depend on how you feel about the songs on this CD.  If you like the first song that you hear you'll probably like the rest of the songs on the CD.

Amazon review: I heard a live performance of the Imagine Dragon's and really enjoyed the music, so I ordered the album. The album unfortunately is a huge disappointment. The mastering of this album is terrible. A number of the songs on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect. When you hear the songs live, the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance. But on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: One of the biggest bands in the world. Really hard to find a way to critique the band since they've only had one album and it's a good one.

CD Reviews

J-Hud – My December

This compilation features songs written by J-Hud – a talented singer/songwriter. The CD features songs from her past and present, but my favorite are the four tracks written by Jennifer. My December has songs like "You Make Me Feel Brand New" and "I Can't Help But Love You." The songs are also featured on her new CD, My December.

I was happy to find a collection of Jennifer Hud's greatest hits in a nice volume of 15 songs. In this compilation, we are treated to four songs that are penned by Jennifer Hud. These songs were written in the past, present and possibly even future (see what I mean by pre future).

I find myself singing the songs from My December over and over, and I am excited to say that many of the songs are ones that I have not heard on any other CD (or in any other compilation). The songs will undoubtedly make great listening as the years go by.

J-Hud – My December

This compilation features Jennifer Hud's great hits and some from her new CD, My December.

This CD has some great songs and some that are great just for you. I am a huge J-Hud fan and have been for years. This compilation has some great songs. I am not sure what makes it better than some of the more recent offerings. I am a lucky girl to have found this compilation.

I would suggest that if you haven't listened to this compilation, that you do so NOW! It is a great way to get to know Jennifer Hud and her music.

I can't help but be amazed by the quality of these songs. They are really excellent and they will stay with me for a long time. I will be buying this CD for sure.

J-Hud – My December

This compilation is great and a great addition to her CD collection.

I have been a fan of Jennifer Hud for years and I am thrilled that she has released this CD. It is great that she has chosen to make these songs her own. I want to hear more of her. Her last CD was a hit and I loved the album. I would love to have her on tour and perform these songs live.

J-Hud – My December

This compilation was great and a great addition to her CD collection.

I have heard of Jennifer Hud before but I just never knew that she was this talented. She is definitely one to watch. She is my new favorite singer. I think that this CD is great. The songs are great and I can't wait to hear what she has in store for me next.

I have heard of Jennifer Hud before but I just never had the opportunity to check her out. So I am glad that I found this compilation. It is great and I am excited to hear

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  There is something about the tone of the music that makes it so easy to enjoy.  It's not overly loud, and is a great intro to a song.

Amazon review: The first few times I heard Tom's voice from this album, I thought it was an imitation, but I thought it would get better as time went on and I listened to it more.  This time though, I thought it was his real voice.  The lyrics are great and it is very easy to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Tom Waits' voice is a great blend of southern drawl and the sound of the electric guitar.  This album is great.  It has an easy to listen to style of music.  I am currently listening to this album while driving in my truck.  I really like this album and will continue to listen to it.  I am a huge Springsteen fan and this album is another great Springsteen album.

Amazon review: I have never heard a Tom Waits album, so I have no idea how this album differs from his previous albums.  The first few times I listened to this album, I thought it was an imitation, but then I realized it was actually Tom Waits singing.  This album is a real surprise.  This is the first Tom Waits album that I have ever listened to, so I am not sure how it's different from the others, but it's certainly different from his previous albums.  I love this album.  I hope that it will get better over time, but for now, it's enjoyable.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This instrumental version of "Over the Rainbow" is absolutely perfect. It seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why I'm saying it's good. A 101 strings orchestra really fills out this song and helps it deliver the impact it was intended to especially during the chorus. Preview it and judge for yourself.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It was a pretty cool CD, a nice mix of rock, blues, country, and a few other genres.  I love the way the instrumentation on each track is consistent.  I also love the fact that each song was made with a different instrument.  I find it a little strange that these songs were released in so many different styles, but I guess I like this.  I would want to hear more from this group.

Amazon review: The CD got to PR in no time, it was in great conditions and it was overall perfect since I love Manson and his new album 
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album. Favorites include Anthem, Run, Outlaws, Scared, Chasing Twisters, and My Whole Life Long. After It All makes me weep with joy. If you've never seen them live, don't miss the chance. Anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand takes, few sound even better live and Delta Rae definitely sounds even better live.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This review is directed at the vendor as opposed to the actual album. Do not buy from New Chapter Recycling, this record shipped in a plain white cover (and damaged at that!) instead of the original cover as seen in the pic. Ridiculous, sending back and ordering from another vendor.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this by accident. I do not like her music which is too explicit. I cannot say I hate it, because that would put me on the fence with love/hate.

###
Amazon review: I have bought a lot of things from this seller. The first time I was in a store with the CD in the case and heard the title of "The Black Widow" and looked at the back of the case and saw a picture of the album cover. I thought if I bought this album, I would like it. Then I heard this song "The Black Widow" and I was hooked. I have been listening to this album daily. I love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wanted to like this album, but I just can't. I am a big fan of The Strokes, The Verve and The Smiths. This album has the same flavor to it as The Smiths and The Verve. However, it is way too loud and way too long. The vocals are way too loud and way too repetitive. The bass is way too loud and way too repetitive. I am a fan of The Smiths and The Verve, but I can't listen to this album a few times a day.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that at first I was very excited about checking out this album. It's a really amazing album, but it's the fact that it has way too much of a good thing than a bad thing, that made me start to not like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Verve ever since they came out on the UK singles chart, I was very excited to hear this new album, I thought it had a lot to live up to, but it failed in every way.

Amazon review: I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free. See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.

Amazon review: Lost is right, this disc being the covermount (not for resale) disc from Classic Rock magazine Issue 103, March 2007. It purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time, overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans. Ummm. well part of that plan has been achieved. They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Well in short, not good at all, not my chemical romance style, if they felt like getting back to the basic's at least go back to decent music like three cheers.

Amazon review: My favorite of theirs, and it's still available to buy. Although I'm not really sure what I like about it. It sounds like a mix of "Nirvana" and "Dixie Chicks." And it's got that song of the week status. But I still like it just as much.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: No album that I have been waiting for, and I have been waiting for it since I heard them at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. I am very glad I waited because this is a gem. Some of the songs are very good, some of them are really bad. But they all sound good and I am sure that they will be played at the next music awards ceremony. They really deserve it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was told when I bought this album that it would be boring, and not good. Well, after listening to it in full I have to say it is not that bad. Some of the songs are very good but other songs have no redeeming features and the vocals are just boring and not real. I will not recommend this to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this dvd because I was looking for something that would have songs that I had never heard of before. Also, I like the cover of this album. I have nothing negative to say about it and it is definately one of the best albums that I have ever bought in my life.

###
Amazon review: One of the best albums of all time, if not the best. There is a reason why this album is not on any of the top ten list. It's a collection of songs that are in the top 20% of songs in rock music. Some of them are very good, some of them are really bad. I don't understand why they put this album on the top of the list in the first place.

Amazon review: I had a hard time trying to find a good copy of this album. At one point I purchased an entire library of songs and then when I tried the songs out on my mp3 player, some of them just didn't sound right.

I really enjoyed this album and I am glad that I bought it, because I got a good deal on it.

I am glad that I got this one, and I am sure that you will love this album too.

I bought it as soon as I saw it and was excited when it showed up on my doorstep. I put it on my turntable and was horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality was.

Amazon review: I have this song at the head of my Classic Rock playlist. Mr. Grey had a great voice, this song has a happy/upbeat tempo and it serves as a kinda thank you for all the songs that follow: "Give me the beat boys!" Just writing this review I need to listen to this again.

Amazon review: I was surprised to hear that this song was released by another artist, but JMC's rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to Christian Kane's power ballad.  I would highly recommend folks go over to Christian's page here on Amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album "House Rules".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know who this song was by, but this is the first song that I've ever heard that is so bad it's good. This song is a "dance party" of sorts with some cheesy lyrics about a guy who has a bad attitude.  I would think that this is the song that would be played in a "dance party" to get the party started, but somehow this song is so bad it's good.  There is some really bad drumming in this song, but it's really not that bad.  The instrumentation is a little off as well.  I think the original version is much better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the kind of song that I think any metalhead would love when they are about to leave the house.  It has a good melody and it's really fast.  I can't even tell you how many times I've heard this song at parties.  I will say that I am disappointed in the song but I don't think that I will be stopping listening to this song.  This song is just a little too fast for me and I don't think that it's that bad.  I don't think I will be changing my playlist, but I will definitely keep this song around.  I think I will have to turn this one down to 5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first song on the CD that I can listen to over and over again without it becoming boring.  I love how this song is written.  I think that you can really tell that this song was written by a master.  This is a really fast song with a good melody.  The first time I heard this song I thought that this song was a little too fast.  I thought that it was really boring.  I just don't like this song.  I don't think that the lyrics are very good and I just don't like the song.  I will give this song a 7/10.

Amazon review: I love Terrance and his acting is superb.  He just can not sing but he can really play the guitar.  I paid 13.00 for the CD and there were only 2 songs i played a little.  I enjoyed the spanish type song.  Maybe if he was able to sing more soulful. Anyway don't pay the CD, but I love you Terrance you are one of my fav actors.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a nice collection, i like the songs on it.  The voice is good for his age and he has a nice personality to him.  I bought the CD for $3.00 and you can get it cheaper.  I like the songs, but that's about it.  Hope he gets back to his old self.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I didn't know this guy so i would not have bought this cd for him, but i would buy it for anyone who is good in the arts.  I have loved Terrance since i was a kid and i am now 70.  i have enjoyed everything i have purchased from this company and i will be purchasing from here again.  I have listened to the CD 3 times now and i don't understand how people can complain about this piece.  He has the voice and talent to sing and play the guitar and he is a very good actor.  I don't think he is a singer, he is an actor, but he can sing, write music, and play the guitar.  i wish he would do more acting.  I bought the cd for $3.00 and you can get it cheaper, the CD is only 99 cents.

Amazon review: I bought this CD, the first time I heard Terrance sing it i immediately fell in love with it.  It has a very unique sound to it and I really like it.  I really like it more than I thought I would.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to music that is inspirational.  I also purchased a CD that Terrance recorded for me, it was his version of 'The Rose of Sharon'.  It is a great tune and I really like Terrance's voice.  He is very talented and very nice to listen too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you want conscious breathing exercises, I would rate this a 5.  Great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues.  Each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes. The problem I had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place.  I bought the CD to get further into conscious deep sleep.  I had the reverse effect.  However, as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body, the meditation does work.

Amazon review: This song was absolutely horrible! It was very distasteful and lacked structure. I do not recommend this song for anyone. In fact, if every CD Nick Lowe made exploded, I wouldn't have a problem! It's terrible. Do not buy or get this song! WARNING WARNING don't buy!

Amazon review: This song is definitely not a top 10, but I think it's definitely a top 50.  Some may call it a hit, but it's not. This song is not about drugs, but about the dangers of drugs.  What is it about? The lyrics are about a person who is addicted to drugs, and his life is slowly going down the drain. I think it was written by somebody who was addicted to drugs. I would advise people to just skip this song. It's not worth listening to.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  I saw Gloria Bills in concert in Cadiz, KY back in October.  I bought their CD and couldn't stop listening to it.  "Always Sometimes" is one of my favorite songs now.  Oh yeah, and  the sister of the lead singer works at Sonic here in Cadiz.  Funny, huh?  Mmmmmmm. cheeseburger.

Amazon review: I was counting down the days to this album being released. I listen to Sturgill's first two albums often and couldn't wait for new stuff. So I buy the album on release day and start listening. WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!?! The 1st track is ok, the Nirvana cover is absolutely putrid, the rest of the album is just boring and generic. Huge disappointment!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Most of the music starts out okay but then in the middle it gets loud and takes on a jazzy type sound which doesn't do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep.  Of course the samples that are given don't let you know that.  Worst 1.99 I have spent.  May not seem like a lot to Amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window.  Amazon can do that with it's own money.  I won't purchase another music from them.

Amazon review: So I finally got around to this CD.  It is amazing.  I think they are doing a great job with the sound and the lyrics.

But I am listening to it all the time and can't stop thinking about what they are doing in this CD.

Amazon review: I saw one of my favorite bands live at the "Cadiz" in Kentucky.  The show was really good and when they came out for the encore they played "Brick House" and "Aurora".

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  As other reviewers have pointed out, the album is nothing special.  It's just a bunch of songs that sound good in a generic style and are all good.  I bought this album because I had heard they did a few CD's and I wanted to buy one.  I don't know why this is such a big deal to me.  I bought it because they are from Kentucky.  That might be a reason.  I think the CD is average.  I don't think it was worth the money I spent on it.  I will not buy music from them again.

Amazon review: I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.

This was the first one I ever bought, I was about 8 when I bought it. My dad was always buying them for me, and I remember having to explain this one to him because it sounded like the "Hallelujah" hymn I sang at church when I was little. I was so embarrassed to buy this, I'd tell him to buy me a new guitar, but I knew he would never say no. It was the first one I ever bought. I'm so glad I bought it, I love it, and he even bought me a new one! He kept it for me, and I'm very grateful.

After listening to this worship album, I was really not sure what to make of it. At first I thought it was a worship album, but then it started to remind me of some of the songs that I used to sing on stage.

Amazon review: I love this album. Favorites include Anthem, Run, Outlaws, Scared, Chasing Twisters, and My Whole Life Long. After It All makes me weep with joy. If you've never seen them live, don't miss the chance. Anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand takes, few sound even better live and Delta Rae definitely sounds even better live.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really love this set.  One thing that I found to be missing was the instrumental version on Side B, "Good Vibrations" which is by far the best song on the album.  The song has an amazing sound to it and a great beat that makes it easy to play along with.  The sound is a nice change from the overdriven guitars and overly aggressive drumming you will find on most of the other songs.  I've been singing along to this song for hours.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a "career spanning" album for years.

Now, I have this album, but I am not making cassettes, so I will be buying the cd version.  It's a great idea and a good album.
