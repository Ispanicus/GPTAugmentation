Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: A great song for the holidays, and a very sad one.  It's a powerful song, but one that's a little simplistic.  It really makes me think that people who are very religious should leave their faith.  I don't think the lyrics are about religion so much as about the lack of a sense of community and belonging.  I would have loved for "Jesus Loves Me" to have been sung with a little more feeling.  I also thought the title was a little bit too corny.  I prefer "Christmas in the Heart of Texas", but I did like the song.  3 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the song, and the singer, but this is a little too commercial and predictable.  It starts out with a nice little guitar lick, then comes down to a clunky, but catchy beat.  It could have been the perfect song for Christmas, but I think it's a little too overused.  3 stars.

"Kool-Aid Man"

Amazon review: I love Lenny Kravitz.  He's a great singer, and a great songwriter.  His songs are always great, and I always learn something from them.  "Kool-Aid Man" has a great chorus and a really nice hook.  The vocals are powerful, and the music is very good.  I don't know if he's one of the best songwriters of our generation, but it's not like anyone has come close.  I would have liked to have seen him play some live.  It's just a really good song.  3 stars.

"Till the Cows Come Home"

Amazon review: I'm really excited about this song.  I've never heard it before but I've been hearing it on the radio, and when I saw the name of the song, I knew I had to check it out.  This song is great.  It's got a great hook and a great chorus.  The piano is great too.  The only problem is that I think the music is a bit too commercial, and the lyrics are too typical, but it's still a really great song.  It's got a great hook and a great chorus.  I don't know if I've ever heard a song that has a better piano.  Maybe it's just me, but the music is so good and the lyrics are so powerful, I think it's a little too commercial.  3 stars.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: Have two of these for my wife and I.  We are thrilled.  They come in so handy.  She is pregnant and we are having our first child so we can't have anything else until it arrives.  These are great for travel and we use them for that.  They are fun to use and the sound quality is amazing.  They are lightweight and take up minimal space in the nightstands.  We've had no problems with our kids using them.  The only problem is that the batteries are not easy to replace.  The batteries are very small so you have to use a screwdriver to get them in.  We have no other problems.  We always have to replace the batteries.  The sound is great and they are easy to use.  The only problem is that we can't do a lot of the things we want to do with them.  We are on a budget so we can't get all the features we want in them.  I would recommend these to anyone.

Amazon review: You know what sucks about MP3 players?  The batteries.  We have two MP3 players and we've had to replace the batteries a few times.  The first one is the one I bought a couple months ago.  It's about 4 years old.  It has been in my kitchen on and off, but had a battery problem.  We brought it in and had the technical support guy fix it, but the battery problem has been a problem since then.  So, after 2 years, we're getting a new MP3 player.  It's been about a month since I took the new one in.  It's been running perfectly for us.  But, that's about the only thing I don't like about it.  It's not a cheap player.  It's a decent player, but it's not something I would recommend.  I would recommend it to a friend, but not everyone needs a new MP3 player.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I'm sure, by now, you've noticed that I have an obsession with this band.  As time has gone on, the more I want to hear that song, the more I like it.

Its a good album, but its not Flame's best work, and that's fine by me.

Interpretation

The album begins with "Escape" which is the first song on the album. This is the same song that was released on the live CD. The "live" version of "Escape" was recorded live at the Austin City Limits Music Festival which is where the album was recorded. There is a live rendition of "I Wrote My Songs" on the album which is different then the studio version on the CD. The studio version of "I Wrote My Songs" is an acoustic version that was recorded in Nashville. The song is played in the key of C.

The second song, "I Wrote My Songs," is the same song that was released on the live version of "Escape". The "live" version of "I Wrote My Songs" was recorded at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. The live version of "I Wrote My Songs" is played in the key of A.

The album ends with "I've Got a Thing About You", which is the last song on the album. The song is played in the key of A minor. The song was originally released on the CD called "Live at the Alamo" and later released on the album "Live at the Alamo".

"My Hometown" is a good album. The songs are all good, but I feel like the three are the best. There are some great songs

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: this is the only thing i've listened to from new york city since they played "the best of everything" on their first "best of" album. i'm not a huge fan of tech n9ne, but i enjoy his music nonetheless. to me he sounds like a very honest and sincere dude, but i'm not a fan of his music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: the most enjoyable release in tech n9ne's discography. tech n9ne's music is always solid and never derivative. his music always has a good message and is always relevant to the times in which he lives.

Amazon review: i haven't heard this song in years, but after a few years of being away from my ipod, i finally got it. and my ipod's been broken for about 5 years, so i just had to go back and listen to this song. the thing about it, is that i can't describe what it is that i love about it, but it is something that i don't mind if other people don't get.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a bit wary of the Killers' new album. I had heard that they were going to do a solo album.  And I was not a huge fan of their last one, so I did not want to hear their new album all the way from the beginning.  Boy was I wrong.

I could not believe what I was hearing, he said" I have never heard such amazing music."

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
