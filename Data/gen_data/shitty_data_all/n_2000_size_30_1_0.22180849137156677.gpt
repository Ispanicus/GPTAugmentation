Amazon review: This album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the 70's and 80's. While I think that Maynard Ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation, Woody brought a pretty decent band along as well, even though he was entering the last decade of his life. Amazing guy, amazing version of La Fiesta. Starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time (were they all Rolands?) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from Woody, there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle: shrieking trumpets, a nifty Tiberi solo, and awesome dynamics.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think that I must have got a bad copy because this SACD sounds awful! it sounds like a cd from 1985

###
Amazon review: And the song is great!  It is a very melodic ballad.  Even though the singer is playing it in a pretty soft voice, the song has a very strong melody.  I'm a big fan of "She Believes In Me", and this song is the second one of his that I heard, and it's great as well.  It's not just a catchy tune, but a very good song.  This is also the first of three songs by Bon Jovi I've heard on an SACD.  This is a well-produced, strong and very emotional song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is a great show of the power of the human voice.  It's not bad, just a little bit too on the soft side for my taste.  It's not the most important song on the album, but it is a great show all the same.  I can see why people would like this, it's a good-sounding track.  I can see why people would like it, but I just can't get into it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There's no doubt that the song is an original masterpiece.  The production is very good, the lyrics are pretty great, the arrangement is awesome and the vocals are stellar.  The song starts out with a slight beat, but develops into a full-on rock 'n' roll tune.  While the song is not the best on the album, it's still a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great track.  For some reason, it just doesn't click with me.  It's well-produced and very well-mixed.  I think it's a very solid track.  I don't mind the drums, I don't mind the bass, I don't mind the guitar at all.  The song just doesn't stick with me.  The lyrics are decent, but I just can't seem to come out on top of this.  The song doesn't have an overall message, and I don't get it.  I think the song is good, but it's just a little too on the soft side for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is great.  It's simple but it works.  The lyrics are quite well-written and have an overall good message.  There's a little bit of country in the beat and the singer is a little more emotional in his delivery.  I don't know where I really rank this song on the album, but it's definitely a good one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an amazing song.  I love the arrangement and I love the vocals.  The lyrics are great and they really make the listener think.  The song's production is pretty good, and I'm pretty impressed with the song.  Overall, this song is a great track and I love the arrangements and the music.  The singer has a great voice and he actually sings the song.  I'm just a little bit skeptical of the lyrics, but it's not a bad song, and I can see how some people might like it.  I just don't feel like it's a real song.  The production is really good and the song is great.

Amazon review: This song doesn't really stand out as great.  I feel like it's just a decent song.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: They need to stay away from the Illuminati symbolism, which I think is an extremely clever way of getting people to buy their music.  The way they use the lyrics, I can't believe that they actually wrote them.  They are really not that great.  At all.  However, I do enjoy their music and I am trying to get more of them.  If you want to get your mind off the Illuminati, try listening to their music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The Illuminati is such a powerful idea that it makes me want to take a long vacation.  They have this song that has this awesome "God will save us" message, but every time I open the lyric sheet I see that it has nothing to do with the Illuminati.  I don't know how to explain it, but they are just really bad.  There just aren't any good songs on this album.  It's almost like they are trying to push people away from listening to their music, because they are just awful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are a lot of Illuminati symbols, but I don't think there is any real message.  They have this weird concept that a "Higher Power" would save us from a horrible world, but I don't think it really has anything to do with the Illuminati.  I don't even know what the Illuminati is, but I hope they don't get any more followers.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There's a lot of Illuminati symbolism in the music, but even people who are anti-Illuminati can't deny the power of God.  The message is very clever and very positive, but it's just a bunch of words.  The only song I can think of that talks about God is "Gods Help You" and they don't even say it, but it's the song that really sums up their concept.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is some Illuminati symbolism, and I am sure that these people know what they are talking about, but I don't think it has anything to do with them.  I don't think people should be afraid to listen to their music.  Their concept of God is very similar to the Bible concept, but I don't think that they really believe in God.  They are just trying to make their music more popular.

Then, there is this song, "The Plan", which is just another song about the Illuminati.  It is just one more song about their concept.  I think they are just trying to make their music more popular and get more followers.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When this album first came out, I thought it was very clever and I was really interested in it.  Unfortunately, it just seemed like I was being fooled.  Their concept is really good, but it just seems like they are trying to trick people.  They want people to listen to their songs and "believe" in them, but I don't think they really believe in God.  Their lyrics are just really dumb.  They just don't have any good songs, and the only one I can think of is "Gods Help You".

I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music- soul, R&B, Rock.

I'm not a fan of the band but I like to support what they are doing.  My favorite songs are "Dance in the Light" and "Don't give up on us baby."  I really like the other songs on this album as well as most of the rest of the album.

Amazon review: It bothers me that the name Last in Line is used here. I remember seeing an interview of the newest (at the time) Leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss. Sure we are entitled to forgiveness, but it bother me Ronnie went to his grave despising VC and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory. after RJD has passed no less.  Onto the music. The vocals are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire.

Amazon review:  This album is a lot of songs I haven't heard before but it is worth the listen.  The music is a lot of fun.  It's fun to listen to the songs and play along with the rhythm.  I have a hard time saying who is the best at this.  I just like the music, I like the songs on this album.

Amazon review: The only thing I don't like about this band is that they were not a part of the rock n roll revolution of the late 70's and early 80's.  They have the same songs over and over.  I find it annoying.  It's like they never changed their sound.  They are basically a rehash of the old rock n roll.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I am so sad that this record is very bad. I love metallica and was excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock. However, you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record. My old records have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old, but as soon as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any levels. It is like the speaker was blown, very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music.

Amazon review: The album is a great listen with a great sound, but there are some tracks that are just plain awful. For example, "Songs from a Darkened Room" is a song with a repetitive verse and a repetitive chorus, it is just annoying.  The only good song on the album is "Don't Dream" which is a great song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first half of the album is great!  I can't stand the second half of the album.  It starts with a great guitar, but from then on, the guitar sounds like someone with a terrible case of carpal tunnel syndrome is playing it.

Amazon review: This album is good, but it's the same songs over and over again.  The same guitar chords are always the same, and if you listen closely, you can almost hear the guy getting fatter!  My advice, buy a new CD.  The album is a great buy.

Amazon review: Great album in all honesty.  The track "God is Alive" is what I call the "Holy Grail" of metal.  I cannot listen to anything after this because there is no other album that can sound like it.  If you are a fan of metal, you need to own this album.  I've been listening to it for the past 5 years and I still love it.  I still play it over and over and over.  There's just nothing to complain about.  This album is brilliant.

The music is great and it shows that the band is truly good. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a group of musicians that has come a long way.

Amazon review: T.C. Ellis had a brief part in Prince's "Graffiti Bridge" (the album and the movie).  His delivery was excellent, so I was truly looking forward to his solo debut. Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

I don't know what else to say about this album. It is an amazing collection of songs, it's just that people don't know what to think about it because it doesn't sound like what they think rock music should sound like. It sounds like something that came from the seventies.

I would give this album a 10 only because of the fantastic songs on the first side.

I have heard the album a few times and each time it is better than the time before. It is such a great album. I never thought I would love this album.

I was at a rock concert, I was in the front row and was on the far end of the stage, and someone in front of me is sitting on my lap and I don't know why, but I started to feel the warm and soft music coming from my friend, and I started to feel my body getting hot and I got goose bumps.

I looked over at my friend and he was looking at me and smiling and there was a song was playing that was so, so, so beautiful. I just sat there for a moment and then I looked over at my friend and he was smiling and crying happy tears and I just started to cry happy tears and started to feel my body getting hot and I felt happy.

Then I looked at my friend and he was looking at me and smiling and crying happy tears and I just looked over at my friend and he was looking at me and smiling and crying happy tear and I just looked over at my friend and he was looking at me smiling and crying happy tears and I just looked back at my friend and he was smiling and crying happy tears and I just kept looking at my friend and he kept looking at me and smiling and crying happy tears and I just looked back at my friend and then my friend just started to stand and he started to wave me over.

My friend came over, and we were just talking and feeling each other and enjoying each other and it was just amazing. And then I was just looking at my friend and he was looking at me and smiling and crying happy and I just looked back at my friend and he was still looking at me and smiling and crying happy tears. I felt like I was falling in love with my friend and we just started to hold each other and we just started to talk and it was just amazing.

I looked down at my friend, and he was still looking at me and smiling and crying happy and I just looked back at him and he started to hold me. I looked back and my friend was looking at me still smiling and crying happy tears and I just smiled back at him and he smiled back and we just started to hold each other and we just talked and we just felt each other and we just started to fall in love with each other and we just started to fall in love with each other and it was just amazing. And then we just started to hold each other and we just talked and we just fell in love with each other and we just started to fall in love with one another.

We both fell in love with each other and we started to fall in love with one another and we started to fall in love with one another and we started to become one. We both fell in love with each other and we started to fall in love and we started to fall in love

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

This is my first time of using Amazon Prime.  
I have used the option of using the free two day shipping option, but the shipment was delayed for about 8 hours. I was a little concerned about this because it seems to be a lot for one day.  I was not that worried because I have a lot of DVDs, so I thought my DVDs would be safe.  I did not expect that my order would take so long.  My orders were shipped, I received the DVDs when they were supposed to arrive.  I opened the DVDs and they were fine.  I have never had any problems with the DVDs, I have used other companies that did not deliver.  The DVDs play fine on my computer, I do not know if they will play on my iPhone, but I do not expect them to.  I will be watching them on my computer, as I usually do with DVDs.  
This is my first time of using the product after paying for Prime.  I think Prime is a great service, I am glad I signed up for it.  I have no problems with it.  My first purchase was almost a week ago, and I have not had any problems with it so far.

Amazon review:.  Some of you may wish to buy this Chicago album because, foolishly like me, you want to listen to the music and songs of the guys in 'Chicago', but you get to listen to the compositions of :  1- 'Dannay Orton',  2- 'Blair Daly',  3- 'Greg Barnbill',  4- 'Dennis Matkosky',  5- 'Chas Sandford',  6- 'Jay DeMarcus',  7- 'Brett James',  8- 'George Hawkins Jr.',  9- 'Marcus Hummon',  who are not in the band.  With only 1 song (out of 12) written entirely by a band member, apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producers think so.

Amazon review: It bothers me that the name Last in Line is used here. I remember seeing an interview of the newest (at the time) Leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss. Sure we are entitled to forgiveness, but it bother me Ronnie went to his grave despising VC and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory. after RJD has passed no less.  Onto the music. The vocals are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire.

Amazon review: I just finished the first part (the second is coming out soon) and I have to say I have to say I am not a fan of the lyrics at all.  I thought that what he was trying to say was actually very profound and that he actually meant it. But he had one too many beers and it was a good one.  His voice just sounded forced and out of tune to me.  His music was ok, but it just didn't have the same vibe and the lyrics just made me cringe and roll my eyes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you feel like you have missed Leppard's finest hour then this is it, all the hype has been deserved and it is certainly in my opinion the best Leppard album to date.  The album is well worth the price.  The album opens with the song "Goodbye My Love" which is a very good song, it was the first song I ever heard from Leppard and it just struck me how amazing it was.  The band had just reformed and they played a new song called "Goodbye My Love" which is a very good song.  The band also played a very good song called "I Know" which was a very good song, but not very long (the song is just over 3 minutes) the band also played a very good song called "I Want to Be Loved" which is a very good song, but not very long (the song is just under 5 minutes)

Amazon review: I like this album but I think the songs are not very good.  The song "I don't want to be with you" is very good and the song "I don't want to be with you" is very good too.

The song "I don't want to be with you" and the song "I don't want to be with you" are very good songs but the song "My Heart" is the best song on the album.  The song "I Don't Want To Be With You" is in my opinion the best song but it is also very long and very boring, I also did not like the song "I Don't Want To Be With You" it is very boring.

I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl".

There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.
