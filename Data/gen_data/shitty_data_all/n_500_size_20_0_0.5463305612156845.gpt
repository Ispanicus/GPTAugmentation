Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: I got my copy of this book from Amazon as a gift for Christmas and I read it in a week's time. I thought it was a great book. It's about music, making music, and it also talks about the history of music. The author is a great story teller and I learned a lot about the world of music in this book.. The book is well written and the music is also well written as well. It's a great book for music lovers and anyone who wants to learn about the history of music.

Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of the "Sonic Boom" series and of J.J. Sakurai's "Street Fighter" as well. I found this game to be fun and very challenging. If you are looking for a game that has a lot of great music in it, this game is for you. The music is very good.  The music that you will hear in this game are not just random tunes or tunes that you would hear in a game. This game has great music.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

This is what I thought when I saw the CD in the mail the other night.  I was excited to find a new King Kong CD and was very happy to see that they included it with the collection of King Kong.  I had never heard King Kong's music before, so I was pretty excited to find out what this song is all about.  I must say that I was disappointed and not at all surprised to find that they have used the same songs that I already have on my CD collection.  Since the new King Kong CD, the music industry has been changing and it's changed the way that people listen to music.  But I was surprised that they did this to the King Kong CD.  King Kong is a great rapper and I just don't understand why they would do that.  They should have gone with a new rapper, or at least, a rapper that is different from the music that we have heard from King Kong.  I think that the new King Kong has a great message, so I will definitely be purchasing a new King Kong CD.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

I would suggest you listen to them all.  In order to enjoy the album, you need to know that the first 3 songs will be the weakest of the songs on the album.  However, I would suggest listening to all of them.  Some of the songs are repetitive, but I feel that I like this to be a great album.  The album is very diverse, and I feel that this type of music is what the world needs now.  I would suggest you listen to the entire album.

A:

I've found the most common thing to come up with on Amazon are "Not what I expected" and "Not what I hoped for".
I've read numerous complaints about this album being a disappointment, and many people say it's the worst album of the band's career.
This album was definitely not what I expected...
The album has a decent amount of decent songs, but the songs were just...not for me.
I was excited for them to release something new, and I think it's safe to say I was disappointed as hell.
I'll start with the good.
The opening track "Prayer" is one of my favorites of any of their songs, and I absolutely love the song.  I've heard them do a cover of the song, and it's as fantastic as it was on the original.
The song "You" is a good song, but it's not my favorite of their songs.  I think "You" is better when they sing it by themselves.
The song "Love is a Battlefield" is excellent.  I love the lyrics and the music.  I love the

I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: As a parent of a first-grader, I could not believe what I was hearing. I have 3 kids and this song made me think of all the times they would play through the song over and over again as they played with their brother. I'm not sure if it's because the song fits the first-grade brain or something else, but it was definitely not the song that I wanted to expose my children to. I would give this song 1 star, but if I had to give it a rating, I would give it 3 stars and say "do not bring your kids to this store."

Amazon review: I'm not usually a fan of the "white boy" genre as it's usually extremely generic and doesn't try to be anything other than that. I'm not a huge fan of this song either, but one of the reasons I gave it a 5 is because of the fact that it's not the worst song ever. It's just the song that I like the least of all the ones on the list.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I purchased this song because it was one of the songs my father requested be played at his funeral. And Rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.
