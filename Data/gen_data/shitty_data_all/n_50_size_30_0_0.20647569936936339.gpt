Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law.  She has a lovely voice but was not in the habit of singing when she was at home.  To cheer her up, I sent her this CD to sing for her.  It made her feel good to hear herself singing and she started singing the first song.  It's a very nice song.  That was when I started listening to the CDs I sent to her.  She has a lovely voice, and, she likes the song.  I hope she likes the song.  I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I was a fan of Eminem before I ever heard this album. And I was a fan of this album when I first heard it. I am now a fan of Eminem. I think he's the most talented artist and he's the most versatile. I don't just like him because of his lyrics, I like him because he's so talented and he's so unique. I feel like his music is a reflection of who he is. I love the way he talks. I love how he sings. I love how he walks. I love how he dances. I love how he moves his body. I love how he talks about his feelings. I love how he thinks. I love how he sees the world. I love how he talks about his dreams. I love how he talks about his fears. I love how he talks about his anger. I love how he talks about his family. I love how he talks about his anger. I love how he dances. I love how he walks. I love how he moves his body.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square

(by Robert Johnson)

A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square is a song written by Robert Johnson and first performed by the Robert Johnson Trio in 1927. The verses are

I met a little girl from the country and she said to me,
"Oh, you are a little star that shines in the sky."
I said, "Oh, I am a little star, but I'm not a star.
I'm a man from the city that just sings the blues for bread."

The song was first recorded by Big Bill Broonzy (also known as Big Boy Broonzy) in 1927, with a recording of the song lasting nearly three minutes, and was released by Big Bill's own label, the Blind Lemon Jefferson Memorial Records, in 1927. It was the first popular recording of the blues by a black artist.

Robert Johnson is considered by many to be the greatest blues singer of the 1920s. While he only recorded a few songs, he is known as the "Father of the Blues" for his mastery of the genre, as well as for his ability to blend the traditional blues with elements of jazz and popular music. The song "I'm a Man from the City" has been recorded by many famous artists, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Artie Shaw, and many others.

This rendition is an excellent example of how the song should be performed, in a style similar to the early Big Bill Broonzy recordings.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Yes, I have been waiting for this CD for a very long time. I was so excited when I heard the news that I had been selected to participate in the first round of a national competition to record music for a national television program. After a month of classes with a wonderful group of teachers, I began to feel more comfortable singing and began to have fun. I was thrilled when I was chosen to be in the first round of the competition. I was confident that I had the talent to win, because after all, this was my first national competition. Unfortunately, my first performance of the song I was judged on "My Favorite Thing" left me disappointed. I don't know if the instructor was too stern on me, or my performance was a little shaky. All I know is that I will always remember the song I performed on stage on my first national competition.

I will always remember that song, and I will always remember that song that was sung on stage on my first national competition.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This is a song I would listen to over and over again if I am in a bad mood, just to hear it.  I can definitely say that the music is a hit within my own personal sound of soul music.  As a musician, I have found that this song is easy to play in my own personal style as well as anyone else's.  I like this song because it seems more real and true to life as well as being a great song to play.  I also like this song because I think it is beautiful.  There are things to like and dislike, but the overall song is very beautiful.  I would like to have a song like this for every genre of music that I play.  If you have a song like this, then you just have to try it.  I would also like to thank the creators of this song for their talent and creativity for writing this beautiful song.  I would like to thank the creator for showing my love for this song and giving me the opportunity to give it to someone else to enjoy.  I hope you enjoy this song.  Thanks again.

Amazon review: It's hard to say no to an album that features two up-and-coming hip hop acts. I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but it's an album I will definitely listen to at least once.  I can definitely say that I like the music on this album.  The raps are pretty dope and I can definitely say that I like the music.  The music is not too over the top which is good because I don't like over the top rap.  But the music is good.  I like this album.  The only problem is that the album is a little long at around 26 songs.  I would like to know if there is an album that has more than 25 songs that people would be happy with.

Amazon review: I'm sure there are lots of people that will agree with anything I say about this album. I was not one of them, but in a nutshell, I think this is a great album for a lot of people.  It has a great flow, good lyricism, and good production.  I would say that this album is worth a listen.  I like everything about it.  The music is good, the lyrics are good, and the production is great.  I would like to give this album a 7.5 out of 10.  I rate this album 5 stars because it is an acceptable album for all genres.  I would definitely give this album a 5 out of 10, but I only gave it a 5 because I do not really like to give an album a zero out of ten.  I would give it a 3.5 out of 10, but I would give it two stars for the reason that the production is a little over the top and the lyrics are kinda cheesy.  This album is definitely worth a listen.

Amazon review: This is a very very good album.  At first I was a little dissapointed...I really didn't enjoy the intro...but after the intro I really liked it.  There are a lot of songs on this album that are very diverse.  This album is a great mix of songs...from Hip-Hop to Old School and Rock.  I would definitely recommend this album to a lot of people...but not everyone.  I would say that this is an excellent album.  This album has good production (the mixing and the instrumentals and the lyrics)...it has a good flow and it has good lyrics and good musicianship.  The best part about this album is the diversity of the music.  This is a great album for people to check out.  I would give this five stars.  I would like to give this album a three out of five because the music is good but the lyrics are cheesy.  The only thing I liked about this album is the diversity of the music.

Review: I'm not a TwizTid fan. I have a lot of respect for their songs. I like the way they sound. But this is the worst album they have ever done. Just flat-out bad as far as I'm concerned. I'm not even sure they wrote songs that I like. I just don't like this music. The songs just dont grab me. There was one good song, but I feel like the songs they sang on this album are just so generic. I mean, if they were going to write a song about the female point of view, why not just write a song about a girl who has had sex with a guy? It just seems very lazy. They did sound different on the songs they wrote, but they just sounded like Twiztid. I just feel like this is an album that could have been good if they had just stuck to their own sound. I wish they had just let it go after Twiztid and just went back to just writing original music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I got this one because I love the band and was excited about getting a new one.  This is a really great album. I have the original and this is the first one that has a female lead vocalist on it.  It is a very different sound than the first two, and I feel they have matured stylistically.  There is more variety on here, but it is still very much a jazz band.  I have to give them a "Yes" for the first two albums though.  The more jazz I listen to, the more I realize how much I love it. The only problem is that this is mostly straight up jazz...which is the worst thing.  I've been a jazz listener since I was 5 years old, but I've never understood why so many people still think of it as "jazz".  The more I listen to other types of music, the more I realize how much I like it, and the more I want to hear more jazz.  There are some really great songs on here, and the instrumentation is quite good for a jazz band.

Amazon review: The music of this band is just incredible.  I have the original albums and they are fantastic.  The band's sound is so clean and fresh and yet extremely deep.  The songs are great and the vocals are just as incredible as I have ever heard.  They have a very unique sound that I feel is completely original.  The sound is very different from the usual jazz and rock bands.  It is different from the usual rock and roll music, yet it is not too different from most of the popular music of the last several decades.  The vocals are more powerful and the sound is more soulful.  I have seen bands like this in other genres of music for years and I have never heard anyone do what this band does.  They are very unique and have a very good sound.  I would have to say that this is the best jazz album I have ever heard.  It is the best jazz album I have ever heard.

This album is also a lot different from other jazz albums that I have gone through.  The sound is very unique and the musicianship is very good.  If you are a jazz fan, or just a fan of music in general, I would highly recommend this album. I would have to give them a "Yes" for the performance.

This is the second movie of the Twilight Saga, the first being New Moon. I liked this movie and really enjoyed it, but I thought the overall production was poor. The movie was rushed and badly directed. I thought the acting was poor from the cast. I also thought that the plot was a bit vague and lacking proper plot to it. I think the only thing I liked about the film was that it had a good message, and that it had a good ending.

This is a sequel to the book and movie The Hunger Games. The book is about a young girl who is forced to participate in a war between three countries; one of which is the United States of America. The main character is Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who is forced to participate in a war between her country and the other two countries. Katniss has a strong belief that she must win the war, and that's the main reason why she is chosen to compete in the game. She believes she is ready to battle and that she is ready to die.

This is a sequel to the book and movie The Hunger Game. The book is about a young girl who is forced to participate in an Hunger Games type battle between three countries. The main character is Peeta Mellark, a young man who is forced to participate in the game. Peeta believes he is ready to battle and that he is ready to die. He has a strong belief that he is ready to kill and that he is ready to die. Although he doesn't agree with the game, he is forced to participate. He believes he is ready to fight and that he is ready to die.

I watched this movie first for the new cast, and I thought the casting was good. I liked what I saw from the new actors, and I thought they did a good job. I think the story was good and I thought that the ending was good. I thought the acting was good in this movie, and I thought that the plot was good. I liked the movie and I thought it was a good movie.

A great movie from a great director. I really enjoyed this movie, and I thought it was a good movie. I thought that the story was good and that the acting was good. The movie was good

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

For a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I was in love with the idea of being a teacher, but my family had to think about it.  I was married and a father of three.  When I was a teenager, I thought maybe I'd be a professional football player.  After I graduated from college, I thought that maybe I'd be a police officer.  After I had children, I thought maybe I'd be a teacher.  I'm now in my forties, and I am still not sure what I want to be.  But I know I can't see my family without loving them, and I'm determined to do whatever it takes to be the best possible person I can be.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This song is probably one of my favorites of all time.  The song is just a perfect example of why the band is so amazing.  It is absolutely amazing to me how they can create such a powerful and beautiful sound and at the same time, keep the words and lyrics so simple and true.
