Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: "When You're Gone" is a very good song. However, if you like the song, you should find "When You're Gone" in the setlist.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I am so glad you enjoyed the review of "I Love You Like a Brother",  I've never been a big fan of the song and find it a little cheesy, but I thought it was pretty good for a young singer.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorites.  I had to include this one on my list because I love the songs.  The lyrics are a little hard to understand because of the different accents in the song, but what I can tell from the beginning of the song is that it is about a girl who wants to be a singer.  So she runs away, and a guy comes along and helps her.  She meets him at a train, and he takes her back home.  They stay together and he gives her a part in the movie he is making.  I know the ending is not very clear, but I did enjoy the song.  I also have a CD of the same music that is titled "The New Singer" by the same artist.  It has a different feel and is a little more upbeat which I like.  It is available for $24.95 now.

Amazon review: This is a nice album.  The lyrics are not to clear.  I have to say that I like the song "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" the best.

I wish I had the album on CD.  When I do, I will give you the name of my favorite.  His name is Donny McCauley.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: The album "Dirty Mind" is a collection of songs by the artist Alex Lacamore. The songs that make up the album all deal with themes of sexuality, drugs, and relationships as well as music and the creative process itself.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

There are a lot of other great songs followed by some songs that are not so great.  "Forgiveness" is a great song, "Come" is also a great one.  "Come" is a song about forgiveness.  This is one CD that I wouldn't give a second thought about purchasing.

Amazon review: I have heard this CD so many times on the radio before.  They did a great job with the cover art.  I am impressed with what they did.  The first song is "Heaven" and I am impressed.

Amazon review: We went to the first play of the CD and we had the CD in our car.  The CD was not in a good shape.  It looked like it had been played with.  The CD is from the 1990's and I really didn't even think that many people would buy it.  We played the CD and I noticed that there were parts that they were not playing correctly.  The song "Tears" was just not that enjoyable, the song is about a woman who can't cry but she is trying to.  I really didn't like the song at all.  The song "You Are Mine" was okay, but the song was really repetitive.  This is one of those CDs you will have to wait until they play it on the radio.

I've been going through a lot of life's events and they all have been very negative and some of them have left me feeling very frustrated.  I've been going through a lot of emotional turmoil and I don't know how to get out of it.  I've been going through a lot of life's events and everytime I see a positive event I feel a sense of relief and I think that helps me get through it.  I wanted to hear positive music, but I hadn't heard anything that was positive yet.  I'm trying to find a way to get out of my current situation.  I've been listening to music for quite a long time and I've never heard anything that really made me feel good and gave me some sort of relief.  Until I heard this CD.  I was listening to this CD and I was feeling very frustrated and I needed some positive music that would give me some kind of comfort.  I also needed a calming music that would give me some kind of relief from my emotional turmoil.  I also couldn't believe the way this CD spoke of a woman who is a master of positive thinking and a person who never gave up on life and loved it so much that she died of cancer.  This is a CD that has done it's job.  It has given me some sort of relief and I've had quite a few people say that they've been seeing me for quite a while and they never saw me with my previous depression.  I'm thankful for this CD because it has given me some sort of comfort and have helped me to get through my stressful life.  This is my first cd that has really helped me and I'd like to thank you for creating it.  Thank you for making this album.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia has a beautiful voice that is full and deep, and when she sings out of tune or loud, her voice can be quite annoying.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best accapellas i've ever heard. It's a nice way to close out a song. I love that the accapella has a little bit of a blues feel. It's not your standard 'let me sing you a song' type accapella. It's got that little bit of a blues edge. It also has the added bonus of it ending the song. I'm glad I bought it.

Amazon review: This is one of the most exciting and diverse albums I've heard this year. I just can't say enough about this album.

Amazon review: This is in fact the Accapella version. I purchased this with the idea of having it as my 'accapella'. I thought I'd rather get the Accapella version instead of the one I have on my iPod! However, I've since decided to get the Accapella version because it was cheaper.

Amazon review: I'm glad I bought this. I would have bought it sooner, but I had a few other things to finish with. When I saw the price I was sure I was going to get the Accapella version even though I was not sure exactly what it would be. I was pleasantly surprised that it was the Accapella version! It's a great and unique arrangement that can be played in different ways. I was really impressed with the recording. It sounds like a professional recording. The recording is very clear and clear and crisp. The recording is very good.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: So after reading about how this album is being reviewed, this is what I am going to say.  As a reviewer, you may be tempted to give a positive review about this album, just to get that good review.  But if you do give a positive review, you will be giving more than a positive review.  Because it will be negative.  It was so bad, at one point they even had a video on their website of their manager yelling at the production team and the other staff.  The most I can say is that most of the songs were bad and they could have done a much better job.  I feel like they could have at least put some effort into the music rather than just adding a bunch of filler.  I would have been ok with this album if there was at least one decent song on the album.  But there is none so this is a waste of both my time and yours.  I can't recommend this album to anyone.  I only wish that I can't give this album a higher rating.  I would hope that they can find a way to make the music better so that people will at least give this album a rating of 1 star (because I would have given it a 1).  But if they don't they will have to take the album off of this blog.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album begins with the title track and ends with the last track.  I like the first track and thought it was the best song on the album.  The last track is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The vocals are laughable.  I am not an expert on rap, but this song should never have been on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the debut album of the legendary group Dillinja, and was recorded in the early 90s, while they were still called the Dillinja Five.  I have heard this album several times, but I do not remember the songs very well.  There are some very good songs on this album.  Some of the songs are similar to the music of the Dillinja Five, such as "Dillinja".  I liked "The Way We Run" and "I Am Dillinja".  I particularly enjoyed the song "Ruffneck".  I do not remember the lyrics very well, but I know it is about a girl who is in love with a man who does not return her love.  I also liked the song "Fashion".  I enjoyed it, but I also think that it is one of the worst songs ever recorded.  I will say that the music of this album is very good.  I think that when this album is played without any special effects, it takes the listener back to the early 90s, when this album was very popular.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The band I am reviewing is called Black Flag.  They are a hip hop band from Philadelphia.  I don't know how much I will be able to say about this album, but I think the music was good.  It reminded me of a hip-hop record I used to listen to as a teenager.  The vocals were very good, especially on "Bitch Better Have My Money".  The singing was good on everything I heard.  I just don't like the lyrics on this album.  I don't remember the songs very well.  This album is good, but I think it is a stretch to call it great.  I will give a 1 star rating to this album.  I think it is a stretch to call it great.

Amazon review : This album is a compilation of many great songs.  I am a fan of this band, so I was really looking forward to getting this.  I am glad I did.

Amazon review: So I was expecting a lot of material from this band, and I was wrong.  For a band that I have been following for a good amount of time, they are still pretty new.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

The CD contains several songs which are from other artists.  You will not find any songs written by Robert Johnson on the CD.  I have only the words of Robert Johnson on the CD and the music is not original.  The CD is a compilation of songs released after the original album.  I would recommend listening to the CD to the original songs and then you can buy the compilation CD.  The CD sounds great and I have not found any flaws."

The second song was ok, I like the chorus and the voice, but the verses seemed a little weak.  The third and fourth song were not very good either.  The fifth song is the first one, and it's ok, but nothing special.  I am going to try to listen to the whole disc, as i have already purchased this, and will return it before I waste my money.

I started buying music from my local record store, and I really liked some of the Beatles songs on this record.
