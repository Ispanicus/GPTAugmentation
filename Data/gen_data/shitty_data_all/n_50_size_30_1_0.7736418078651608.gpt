Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've liked every song on this CD, but for some reason the "All of Me" is my favorite.  I really like Meghan Trainor, but this CD isn't for me.  I will still listen to it over and over again, though.  I'll try to listen to it in different order.  What I like is that Meghan keeps adding songs, but the music style doesn't change.  These songs are "rockin'", and they are catchy tunes.

Amazon review: This isn't a bad CD, in fact, it's a great CD.  I really like the songs but I don't like the music.  I don't like the songs with lyrics, especially the songs that are about girls.  The first song is a little bit sad, the second song isn't that great, and the last song is just a good tune, but I don't like the lyrics.  There are a lot of good songs in this CD, but the songs are all about girls.  I don't care about the songs about guys.  I don't like the song about the cow, and I don't like the song about the bunny.  It just doesn't seem to have a theme.  I don't like the songs that are about relationships.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the song "Happiness".  There are a lot of good songs on the album, but I don't think Meghan Trainor is as good as Katy Perry or Carly Rae Jepsen.  I do like the song "Happiness" though.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of listening to this CD
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the title track and I like the last song.  I liked the songs that make me feel happy.  I like "Happiness" and "All Of Me" and "I Will Always Love You".  I think it's a good album.  I like the song "Crazy".  I think it's a good song, but I don't think it's very good.  I like "All Of Me", but it's too slow.  I don't like most of the songs on the album.  I don't like the song "My Heart" because it's all about a guy and I don't think that's a good song.  I don't like "All Of Me" because most of the songs are about girls.  I don't like the song "Happiness" because it's not that great.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The CD was the best CD I have ever listened to.  My wife and I went to a Christian country music concert this past weekend and I was so envious of those who have a great time every time they go to a concert.  I was so envious of those who have a great time every time I go to a concert.  It is the worst thing in the world to have a favorite song that will be played on the radio and you can't even enjoy it.   I have listened to hundreds of songs but I have never listened to any song that was so terrible.   I was disappointed in Twiztid's lack of originality and I was disappointed in Twiztid's inability to sing well.   The lyrics are horrible.  They are offensive and so stupid that they make me want to vomit.  I can't believe I am writing this review because I think Twiztid should be ashamed of their inability to sing well.  I hope they are so ashamed that they never play any of their songs on the radio again.  They are also so disrespectful that they don't even know how to read the lyrics.  You can get any song that you want from the radio and you don't even have to listen to it all.  And I can't believe that they had the audacity to use the word scream in their name.  I hope they are so ashamed that they never play any of the songs on their album again.  What a joke.  I just want to give Twiztid a good review and a hug by saying "I love you".  I am sure that is what Twiztid means by their name and it is the best review I could give.   I wish that I had the power to cancel the radio stations because they are so stupid that they won't play Twiztid.  I hope they are so ashamed that they never play any of Twiztid's songs on the radio again because I would hate to have to listen to their awful music all the time.  I love Twiztid but they are so bad that the radio stations will not play their music.   I hope that they are so ashamed that they never play any of Twiztid songs on the radio again.  I hope that they are so ashamed that they never play any of their songs on the air anymore because I hate their music.  I hope they are so ashamed that they never play any of songs on the radio again because I hate their music.  I have been listening to Twiztid for a long time and I have never found a song that I have as much of a problem with as Twiztid.  There are only a few songs that I have real problems with.  I have listened to them all and I have been very happy with all of them.   I have never felt this way about any other band.  The songs that I have problems with are the ones that are written by Twiztid.  They are dumb like their songs are stupid.  They do not even know how to read music.  They have no originality.  They do not even know how to write an original song.   I wish that they were so ashamed that they give up and stop playing any of their songs on the radio.  It is their fault for not knowing how to read music.   That is why Twiztid is so stupid that they are not even able to read music.  I hope that Twiztid is so ashamed that they never play any of their songs on the radio again because I hate their music.  I hope they are so ashamed that Twiztid never plays any of their songs on the radio again because I hate their music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This song is a bit of a mixed bag. First of all, this is not a traditional love song.  I am not sure if it is supposed to be or not.  At any rate, it has some good lyrics and some pretty good music.  That's about it though.  I don't think the music was good with it.  It had a lot of drums and a lot of guitar.  There were a couple of good parts to it though.  I like the lyrics though. They were good.  The only thing is that the music wasn't very good.  Maybe it is just me though.  Overall, I liked this song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought some time.  I'll get back to it, but I am glad I did.  Really liked this album.  It's an old timey vibe with a lot of energy.  I would have bought a second one, but I didn't even get a chance to review it.  I don't know if I'll get around to it.  I have it.  I can listen to it again.  And I can still get it.  If I don't, well, I'm going to get it again soon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I will not let any song or artist or album sway me from my decision to purchase any of the music.  If I don't like it I will just stop listening to it and never buy it.  I don't know if it's a good or bad thing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Not a bad album but not as good as it once was.  The only thing I would say is that if you love the early 80's then you will love this album.  The songs are old but are not dated at all.  The sax player is great and everyone else is pretty good.  I wish more of the band would give it a second chance but I will be happy with buying all of their albums if they ever do a follow-up to their debut.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I love this band.  I own all their albums except for this one.  It has that 80's feel with a bit of '90's with a little '60's thrown in.  The album is not bad but not as good as it once was.  The guys are super talented and the sax player is great.  I was actually going to buy this cd when the cd shop I go to got it for $12.99 but I decided to try it on their website since I thought it might be worth it.  It was, but the price was $12.99.  I have no idea why.  I am guessing it's because the cd shop didn't have it or something.  I have all the other cd's.  I will buy them when I get the chance.  Thanks for posting your comments.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love all the albums.  Most of it is great.  This is my favorite of the lot. I just picked up 'A Thousand Miles'.  The sax player is better than ever.  I haven't heard the sax player in years but when I did he had to stop playing for a few minutes.  I also picked up 'The Story of Me and You'  and 'Songs of Life'.  I don't know why I picked up these 2 cd's.  I just like the way they sound.  This is my favorite so far.  If you need a sax player to play on one of your songs or a guitarist to play on your song then this is the place to find them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the band, I own all their albums and I wouldn't change a thing about them.  I always thought the sax player was a little off.  His playing is so off that it's hard to listen to his playing.  I listened to this album for the first time about 6 months ago.  I thought it was good but I didn't think it was as good as before.

It is very clear and very clear sounding, but the voice is not the same and it does sound like it is singing in an opera, which is not a good thing.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The things I remember about him are his beautiful voice, great guitar playing, and the way he lives his life. In the early 50's he recorded a few songs that set a new standard for the blues singer. The first song I heard him sing was "Lonesome Blues" and from that day I knew that I could love to sing. I have listened to this album for many years and still love it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson's music has been called "unique." He was a man who sang about his love for his woman, his family and his faith. His music is not only filled with passionate words and lyrics, but also shows a great love of his family, friends and fans. He is also a masterful guitarist who has played his guitar for more than 50 years and has recorded more than 200 songs.

This may be the most common comment I receive about the Hall & Oates songs. It's a sad commentary on music. I don't know if it comes from the fact that people can't stand bad music; they just don't understand why they find it so offensive. Or maybe it's the fact that they are so full of themselves that they can't accept anything that doesn't agree with them.


I don't know. I just don't think that it's the Hall & Oates songs that are offensive. I think it's the people that take them so seriously that I find offensive.

When I played the Hall & Oates song "It's Your Thing", in a meeting last week, the person in the meeting had no idea who Hall & Oates were. And then he says, "Oh, I like that song." I said, "You've never heard of Hall & Oates?"

It's not the Hall & Oates songs that are offensive, it's the people that take them so seriously.

What I mean by that is that they are so full of themselves that they can't accept anything that conflicts with what they've been taught. I mean, it's not that Hall & Oates are themselves that offensive, it's the people that take them so seriously that they can't accept anything that conflicts with what they've been taught, and they take it seriously.

I think the real reason that a lot of people find Hall & Oates offensive is because of the people that take them so seriously. They are so full of themselves that they can't accept anything that conflicts with their own personal beliefs.

I'm not saying that I think that the Hall & Oates songs are offensive, they are not. I'm just saying that when I play them, it's not just from my own personal beliefs, but from the beliefs of the people that take them so seriously.

If you listen to most of the Hall & Oates songs, you'll find that they are quite a bit more melodic than their contemporaries.

Some of the songs like "I'm a Loser" and "Crying on Your Mind" are really hard to sing. But, to me, the songs like "It's Your Thing" and "Everybody Needs Love" are very easy to sing. I enjoy reading what people have to say about "It's Your Thing" and "Everybody Needs Love", but I find it a bit odd that people don't seem to understand why I find those songs so easy to sing.

I mean, it's not that they're easy to sing, it's that I enjoy listening to them. I just think that people are very critical of it because they are so full of themselves that they can't accept anything that disagrees with their own beliefs, so they can't accept anything that doesn't agree with their beliefs.

I have no idea why people don't like Hall & Oates. I have no idea. I'm just saying that I don't necessarily agree with them.

I don't understand why people find the Hall & Oates songs to be offensive. I

Amazon review: This CD was purchased for me by my husband for my birthday.  He was hoping to get some new music.  He said that he was blown away by the music, but he still didn't like it.  It just didn't seem to be his thing.  I didn't like it either but I'm not sure why he did.  I'm not the type to listen to country music.  I'm more of a pop and rock girl.  I tried to listen to the album in a different order, but I still found it to be a little boring.  What I did like was the new single, "Heartbeat" by Meghan Trainor though.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
