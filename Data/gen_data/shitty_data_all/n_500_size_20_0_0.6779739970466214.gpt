Amazon review.  I've been using this for a while.  It's been useful, but hasn't been stellar.  I'm not a big fan of Demi Lavato's music.  I think this is a vanity project.  I'm not sure what the point of the album is, but it is good, so I guess that's all that matters.  I think this is like her voice, but not as good.  It's not awful, but a lot of it is just like her, and not very good.  I don't know.  Kinda like how I feel about her albums:  I like it, but I don't know that much about it.  I'm probably the same for all her other albums.  This one's the first one that I bought, and I don't know much about it.  It's not terrible.  Maybe next time I'll like it.  But, it has a few good songs, but I think there are better albums out there.  If I was to make my own, this would probably be the first song I would choose.  If I had to choose one song to start a song collection, this would probably be it.  I think it's a good song, but I don't know that much about it.  I think I have this album for like a year now.  I don't know if I could listen to it over an extended period of time, but it isn't awful.  But, it's not as good as the two prior albums.  This was the first one I bought, and I don't know much about it.  It may sound very self-indulgent, but it's not.  I don't know how she can stand to put something this bad out there, but she does.  It's like she has a "greatest hits" album.  It's not terrible, but it's not great.  It's not good, either.  It's just kind of not very good.  The album starts off with a song that is pretty good, but then it sounds like the same song, over and over.  It's kind of like a bad remake of a good song.  Not a bad album, but not one that I would recommend to my friends.  There are a few good songs, but I don't know why she put this out.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

I love this CD & have listened to it over 200 times. The other new artist I have been listening to is Alicia Keys.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: After listening to this record almost a year after I first purchased it.  I must say, that I am very disappointed.  The music isn't bad, it has a certain style, but the lyrics are the worst!  The song that I feel the most shame for listening to is the song "The Sound of a Million Demons."  It is the worst song I have ever heard in my life.  There are times when I listen to this song over and over again. It's like I am going crazy.  The second worst song is "I Can't See You".  I don't know if I am happy he wrote a song like that for a hip-hop artist, but he does.  It seems like he is trying to be edgy, but he has lost focus.

Music CD of the Week

Music CD of the Week

There was a time, and it was many, many years ago, when music was a much more pure, simple, powerful, and exciting experience to the average person. Today, as I type, I am listening to a CD by a group of musicians that I have no interest in whatsoever. This is not because of their music, which is good, but because of the fact that they are members of a group called the Beach Boys.

These guys were at the top of their game back then. They had the power to make people feel, for a brief moment in time, that they were, indeed, not just an ordinary person, but in fact, a god. They had the power to make the world feel a little bit better because they were in the presence of a god.

And today, they have all but disappeared.

I am not here to say that the Beach Boys are a bad band. Quite the opposite. They are certainly the best band that anyone could have chosen to be a part of their music. But the truth of the matter is that they have been replaced by the New York City Ballet.

I don't know how many of you have ever heard of the New York City Ballet. I'm sure that you haven't. Well, you probably have seen them on television, you have probably seen them in the movies, or you may have even heard them on the radio (if you have a car or a radio). But do you know any of them? Do you know that the New York City Ballet has the best sound that any musical group in history has ever had?

Now put yourself in my position. I am listening to a recording by the Beach Boys. This is the band that I have always liked the most, ever since I was a small child. Now, to top it off, they have been replaced by the New York City Ballet.

So what does this mean? What does this mean to me? What is the difference between them and the New York City Ballet? What is the difference between the Beach Boys and the New York City Ballet?

Well, the only difference that I can think of are the names on the album. The Beach Boys have been replaced by the New York City Ballet.

So, who is it that is replacing them? Who is it that has taken the place of the Beach Boys? Well, they are called the New York City Ballet and they are a group of dancers and musicians.

So, who is it that is replacing them? Who has taken the place of the Beach Boys? Well, they are called The New York City Ballet

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if I would classify this album as Country music, but it seems like a lot of the songs were written by a man, so he must be a man. Songs like "I'll Take You There" and "I'm Still Dreamin'" were not very good. Songs like "It's Hard to Believe" and "I'll Keep On Singin'" were good. The songs "Here's That Rainy Day" and "I've Got to Tell Him" were good. If you are a country music fan, this is a must have album.

Amazon review: I had been listening to Country for a while, but had never heard this kind of Country. This album is a little Country, a little Americana and a little Rock n Roll, but I think that's ok. I would say it's a mixture of country and rock n roll.

Amazon review: I would like to think that Country is a genre that is not for everybody.

I think that Country is the most recognizable and popular genre around. There are many genres that are more recognizable and popular, but I don't think that they are necessarily better. Country music is, but I don't think that other genres are necessarily better that Country.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments.

Amazon review: This is a classic.  I can't stand when a band is this good, but this album is a classic.  Al has the ability to have the best songs on the album.  He has the ability to make the best songs on the album.  He is never predictable.  He never repeats himself.  He never gets boring.  He gives us some of his best songs on this album.  They are in the top 40 but a lot of them are in the top 10.  Some songs are great, some are not great.  A lot of the songs are solid.  I don't know what's up with the production of these songs.  They can sound pretty good and they can sound pretty bad.  I know it probably has to do with the way the musicians play the instruments.  The songs sound good in the studio, but the songs sound bad live.  I know, I know, I don't have the answer.  But I know it's probably just the way Al plays his instruments.  I know it's likely he's playing the same way on stage as he is in the studio.  But the musicianship and arrangement is probably making the difference.  The only problem with this is, the band is a little too good.  They sound like they are having fun, which for some reason, is not always a good thing.  The album has some of the best songs by a male artist.  And, the album is the best album by an artist from the mid-1970's.

I'm not going to buy this album and I won't buy the next album.  I'm just going to give this album a negative review because the writing is so bad.  This is the worst album I've ever heard.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

I listen to other songs on the album that are very similar to this, but they're not as offensive as this song.  I really don't know how they manage to include this song on the album.  I don't understand why a song has to be "bad" to fit in the album.  I guess there's no room for "good" songs in the album, so it's a good thing for them to play these sort of songs.  It's not just this song.  The entire album consists of these sorts of songs.  It's like they're trying to sell a movie.  You have to have the good parts and the bad parts.  Or else, you can't have a movie.  If you have the bad parts, then you can't have a movie.  It's like a movie with a missing "good" scene.  It's like a movie that has no "happily ever after" or "coming home".  They can't sell it that way.  They just have to have it all.  They have to include the bad stuff, or else they can't sell it.  It's like the worst of both worlds.  It's like selling a movie with no music.  It's like selling a movie without a climax.  It's like selling an actor without a movie.  It's like selling a movie with no good scenes or bad scenes.  It's like selling a movie with no good parts or bad parts.  It's like selling a movie with no climaxes or bad climaxes.

Amazon review: I like the original version better and to me, it is a lot more interesting, the original the lyrics are a lot more interesting.  But the dubbing on this is awful. The vocals are horrible and the lyrics are awful.  I just really don't like this song.  It is a terrible song, and I hate it.  I hate the lyrics. They are so horrible that I can't believe this is an original song.  I am not a fan of Lady Gaga.  I don't have any problem with her other songs.  It's just this one is so bad that I don't have any good words to say about it.  Just awful.  I like the original song better, and I hate this one.  I think the dubbing is a little better on this one, but I don't think it is worth the price of shipping.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
