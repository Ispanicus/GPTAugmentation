Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Their newest album is really good.  Their music is really good.  You should buy it!  Even if you don't like the album, wait for the single of "Collide", which is their best song, and the album, which is much better, "A Beautiful Deception".  I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the band.  If you don't like them, just keep on listening to their music or watch their videos.  I'm sure you'll like them.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This CD is really good. I have heard most of his other CDs and this is one of the best songs on them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to his collection since 2000 and this is the only cd of his that I have not purchased.  The only CD I have never heard is "Wedding Bell Blues".  I am glad I bought this CD and hope that it will be my one and only.  I have bought a lot of his other cd's and have been disappointed in it's quality to the point where I had to return them.  I have listened to his other cd's and this one is by far the best.  Everytime I listen to it I am totally blown away by it's quality and my wife also thinks it's the best one as well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think I will like this CD. I have listened to it for about 45 minutes before I decided to go to bed so I will be able to listen to it again in the morning.  I just bought it today and I have to say it is fantastic! I will have to listen to the other songs a few times. I have not listened to this CD yet but I have listened to all of his other cd's and I have to say this one is not only great but very well thought out and well produced too. I am in love!

Amazon review: Very poor quality.  The material is very rough and I have had some of the better ones at the store get scratched.  I wouldnt be surprised if the blades started to rust after a few weeks.  The colors are not even close to what is shown in the pictures.  I wouldnt recommend it.

Amazon review: I received a package from amazon and opened it.  The package had a note that said the item was damaged and that they would not accept it back.  Not good.  I contacted amazon and they called me and told me they would send another one.  The second one had the same issue.  The problem is that I wouldnt let the first one get damaged.  I returned the item and requested they sent a new one but they never did.  It was very disappointing.  I also received an e-mail from amazon that said they would be sending a replacement.  They never did.  I still have not gotten my money back from amazon.  If youre buying anything from amazon, just keep in mind that if you dont like the quality, dont buy it.  I think amazon needs to change this policy.  This is not the first time I have had to return an item from amazon.

Amazon review: This is an awesome baby music CD.  I'm a parent of a very young baby and this baby loves this CD.  The only things I would change are the colors.  I would like a baby blue and a baby pink.  The songs are great.  The only problem with this particular CD is that it is very long.  It is 3.5 hours of music.  I would love to hear a CD that is only 2 hours and 30 minutes and less.  There is a CD called "Baby Love" which is 2 and a half hours and 30 minutes that is great.  I would love to hear this CD and my baby would love it.  This CD is very good.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because it used the words "toddler" and "baby" in the title and it sounded like the type of music I was looking for.  I downloaded the free version first.  When I finished listening to the whole CD, I began to see the flaws immediately.  I was happy to see that it was a free download.  After two hours of listening, I was done with it.  I returned it and the CD was sent back to me.  I've never had a CD returned from amazon.  I've had the same DVD returned and I'm pretty sure they gave me a second one.  I'll just have to return this CD as well.  I will not recommend this CD to anyone.  It is not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a new mom and this is the first CD I have had a chance to listen to.  I downloaded the free version first.  The whole thing took me about 3 hours to finish.  The reason I started listening to the free version is that I had a hard time just getting through it.  The songs are nice and the songs are appropriate.  The songs were "baby" and "toddler" in the title.  
I would like to have had the CD in my baby's first year.  There is a CD called "Baby Love" that is 3.5 hours and 30 minutes.  I was just about to give up on it.  I finally downloaded the free version and I am glad I did because it took me only a few minutes to finish.  I am glad I listened to the free version first.  It is a good CD.  I would recommend this CD.  The songs are nice and the songs are appropriate.  The only negative thing I could think of would be that I would change the title to "baby" and "toddler".  It took me a few hours to finish the whole CD.  The songs are nice and the songs are appropriate.  All in all, I would recommend this CD to new moms- especially those who love listening to music.  There are some good songs in this CD that I would recommend to parents.  I would recommend this CD to parents.  I would recommend this CD to parents.  I think youd have to keep the CD in mind that if you dont like the songs, dont buy

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album was good, but not for me. The band is very good, but I don't know, maybe that's the problem. I think it is because I am so used to their previous music in which they tend to sound a little too much like themselves. Also, I tend to not like the band when they play at their best.

###
Amazon review: I didn't really enjoy the whole album.  I will probably listen to the whole thing again later and see if I can get a better opinion.  I'm not sure what the exact problem is.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This song is very good.  Very inspirational.  Very motivational.  I have known this song for many years and I was shocked to hear it in a CD.  I have tried many different CDs but have to admit I have never heard anything like it.  I have a friend that is a very creative person and she has always told me to listen to a song and she would tell what song it was.  I was so happy when I went to the store to buy this CD.  I found the song on the cover of the CD and immediately I pulled it out.  It was like I was hearing a new song that I had never heard before.  I have always had an interest in learning music and have always loved listening to music.  I have always loved the music I have heard and have always wanted to try to learn it.  Since I started learning the violin I have wanted to learn more and better.  I am so happy I have found this CD.  All the songs are different and when I listen to it I feel I am hearing it for the first time.  I am so happy I have found this CD.  Thank you so much.

Amazon review: This song reminds me to be grateful for what I have.  My wife and I go to church on Sundays and I sing this song to our pastor.  He always comments on how it reminds him in his sermons of how blessed we are.  It is such a happy song.  I have learned a lot from this song.  It has helped me to live a more positive and happy life.  It has helped me to be more positive.  I love how it has brought me such a positive feeling.  I don't know how else to put my comments.  I am so happy I have found this CD.  I couldn't wait to listen to it.  I am so happy I have found this CD.  It has been a blessing to me and I love it.  Thank you.

Amazon review: I just discovered this song and I must say I love it!!  I have been looking for a song that is a little bit different, not too much but different.  This one is really nice and I hope you can do more with it.  I really like the way it flows.  I bought this CD and I was very surprised.  It has a different feel to it, a little more upbeat but that is okay because I really like the music.  I love it.
