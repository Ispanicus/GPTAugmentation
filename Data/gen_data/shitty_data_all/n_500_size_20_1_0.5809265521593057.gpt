Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: No one is going to listen to this, it's like a bad rap song made by a very ignorant person.  I am sure that there are at least a few people that like rap music, but not me.  This song is boring and there is no point to listening to it.  I will never listen again to this song.  I can't believe that in a day and age people actually enjoy listening to this kind of music.  I hope that the person that wrote this review has a family and doesn't have someone who listens to this kind of music and actually enjoys it.  I have a feeling he or she is an idiot.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this song is here, but it's not that bad.  It's a little annoying, but not really bad.  It's just a little irritating.  I'm sure that most people that like this song would think that they are the only ones who listen to this song.  I have a feeling that people who are in this type of relationship have listened to this song and it's annoying.

Amazon review: This song is so boring that I don't care what the song is about.  It's just another song that makes me think of how I would enjoy a good movie.  The last song on this album is so boring that the album is just a waste of my time.  I'm sure that there are at least a few people out there who like this song.  When you listen to this song you will think that it's a really good song, but when I listen to this song I am thinking that it's just another boring song.  It's no different than listening to a commercial for a product that you don't really need.  I know that this song is just for the girls, but if you like to listen to this song you are going to have to find a better reason to listen to this song.

Amazon review: I was very impressed with this album.  I only needed to listen to the first 4 songs and I knew that this album would be something special.  My only problem with this album is that the songs are too long and the song lyrics are too long.  I found that the music is very good.  The music is very smooth and not too loud.  The songs are very interesting.  The lyrics are very interesting and I enjoyed them.  However, I do have a few problems with this album.  The songs are too long and the song lyrics are too long.  The lyrics are very boring and I don't think that they are very original.  I think that this album could be more interesting if the song lyrics were shorter.  I would also like to see a couple of better songs on this album.  The songs that I have listened to are very boring.  The music is very smooth and the song songs are not very interesting.

It took me a while to find the right song to put on the CD, but when I found it, I knew that I had made the right choice.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I bought this album expecting to hear songs that were similar to "I Am a Child," but instead, the only songs that came through were "The Ballad of Jane" and "Jolie's Dream."  The rest were just not good.  I would not play this with the sound turned up high because I thought it would be better with a lower volume.  Instead, I put it on the CD player and was surprised to hear "The Ballad of Jane."  Now, it is not a holiday song, but I think it is one of the best songs he ever wrote.

Amazon review: This is a very strange album.  There is a song called "The Ballad of Jane."  It is a song about a little girl in England that had to have her throat cut.  The song is about a woman who is in love with a man, and she is not allowed to marry him.  She dies and is buried in the churchyard.  The man finds her and the song is about him.  It's a very good song.  I can understand why it would be a little sad.  The song is about a woman who is in love with a very, very old man that is in love with her.  He cannot have her, and he is so very old.

Amazon review: This album is a weird album about a guy who has to leave his wife and kids.  He is looking for a woman that he has to leave his wife and kids for.  He is a very bad guy, and the woman that he wants to marry dies and is buried in a cemetery.  The woman that he finds dies and is buried in a cemetery that is near the cemetery that he has to leave his wife and kids for.  The album itself is weird, but the songs are beautiful.

Amazon review:  This is a very good album with some good songs.  The song "You Don't Belong" is very good.  "We Got Our Own" is a good song and the rest are good.  I liked "In the Hall of Love" and "You Don't Belong."  "We Got Our Own" is a good song, but there isn't enough good songs on the album.  "You Don't Belong" is a very good song, but it is so short that it doesn't really make much of a difference.  "In the Hall of Love" is a very good song.  "I Know What I Like" is a very good song.  "I Don't Feel Like Dancin'" is a good song, but it's way too short.  "I Don't Feel Like Dancin'" is a very good song.  "I Don't Feel Like Dancing" is a good song.  "We Got Our Own" is a good song.  "In the Hall of Love" is a very good song that is like "In the Hall of Love" by the Monkees.  "You Don't Belong" is a very good song.  "The Ballad of Jane" is a very good song.  "I Know What I Like"...I like the song "I Know What I Like" a lot.  The song "In the Hall of Love" is a very good song.  The song "We Got Our Own" is a good song.  "You Don't Belong" is a good song.  "You Don't Belong" has a very good hook and a good lyric.  "We Got Our Own" has a good hook and a good lyric.  "In the Hall of Love" has a good hook and a good lyric.  "I Don't Feel Like Dancin'" has a good hook and good lyrics.  "I Don't Feel Like Dancing" has a good hook and good lyrics.  "I Don't Feel like Dancin'" has a good hook and good lyrics.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: This is the most disappointing song on the album.  It's not bad, but it's not good either.  It's not Dylan's best song, but it's not that bad either.  It's just not a great song.  I suppose I can't help the fact that the lyrics are a little offensive.  But, the song is good.  I just don't like Dylan's new look.  I can't relate to him anymore.

Amazon review: He didn't make this song great.  He sounded like he was singing a pop song.  I like the song.  It's just a bit too pop for my liking.  If he was singing a decent song, it would be great.  Why didn't he make a decent song like "One Too Many Mornings," or "When I'm 64 (Or 65, or 66, or 67)."  He made a weak song, and it's a real turn off.  I'm sick of hearing these songs.  I don't have to listen to them.  I wish I could forget them.  What a miserable excuse for music.

Amazon review: I thought he did a good job of portraying the anger he felt at the time.  I like that he didn't try to sound too smart.  I like that he didn't try to sound too cool.  He wasn't trying to sound like an expert.  I like that he didn't try to sound like a country star.  This song is about his anger.  It's not a song about wisdom or common sense.  It's about a man who was wronged.  It's about a man who was misunderstood.  It's about a man who was used and abused, and he was not responsible for his actions.  It's about a man who was abused by his family, and he's trying to get the attention of his abuser.  It's a man who just wants to have a good time and be loved.

He didn't try to sound like a pop star.  He sounds like he's singing like an expert, but he isn't.  I liked that he didn't try to sound like a rockstar.  He sounded like he sang a rock song like the Beatles, but he wasn't.  He sounded like he sang a rock song like the Stones, but he wasn't.

This album is not that bad.  It's not a great album.  It's not the best album ever.  It's not a good album.  This album is OK.  It's not bad, but it's not great or amazing.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

When I first heard this song I thought it was a very good song. Then I went back and listened to it again and found some things that bugged me. It's not a bad song but I think that when I listen to it at the same time as other songs I'm not hearing the lyrics. I get the words and I hear the song, but the singer isn't in sync with the lyrics. After I take a few days off from using this song,I will play it for a couple of days again, but it'll be different. I won't be as blown away by this song as I was when I first heard it. I don't mind this song, but I think that if you are going to put words down I'd like to hear them and that you can hear them.

I'm a fan of the song and I've been playing it since the 80's. It was popular in the 80's. I like the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background. Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song. I like the song!

But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I'm having a hard time following this. Can you explain the song a little bit more?  I love to sing it in worship and praise team meetings.  I've tried to find the song online and have not been able to find it, but I know it's out there.  I just can't seem to find it.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I first heard this album when I was ten years old, I can still remember the moment when I finished the first side of this album and I decided to buy the rest. I went back and bought it again and again, it was always in my car stereo so I could listen to it through headphones. I have always considered this album to be one of my favorite albums and I like listening to it, but over the years it has suffered from various sound issues and low quality recording. I have to give this album a 9/10 because the album has it's good points.

Amazon review: The first and original album recorded by a major-label band. It was released in late 1968. It consists of two sides and a b-side, the latter of which is a previously unreleased duet with the band's vocalist, Dennis Linde. The album was produced by John Cale.

Amazon review: Not sure if this is a good album or not. I bought it for Christmas and it is a great album, but I don't know if it is a good album or not. I have tried to listen to it several times and it sounds like a mix of different songs, so I don't know if it is a good album or not. This is a good album for Christmas though.
