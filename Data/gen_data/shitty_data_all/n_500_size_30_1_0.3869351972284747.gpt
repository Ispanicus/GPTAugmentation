Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I really thought this was going to be good, but after about 10 seconds into the song it just totally disintegrates.  I love the bass line, but the song is just not the same without the guitar riff in the beginning.  The song is OK, but just not worth the price of admission.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is a talented man with a great songwriting style.  This song is a good example of his talents.  The song is good, it has a good beat and the lyrics are great.  The song is just a little over three minutes long, which is more than enough time for the lyrics to get through the song without being lost in the background.  The song is not as good as some of the songs on his last two albums.  I think he should have just stuck with the songs from his other albums.  I don't think you can go wrong with Lenny Kravitz.

Amazon review: I must admit that I didn't like this song at all, but after reading through almost all of the other reviews and listening to about eight minutes of the song, I decided that I'm going to give it a try anyway.  I'll give it a try to see if I can get into the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Lenny really does deliver the goods on this one.  It's a good song that I think would be a hit if it wasn't for the terrible beat and lyrics.  I really wish he would have just let the song stand on its own.  It's a good song, but it's just not up to the standards of the other songs on the album.

Amazon review: This is a good original album, i bought it because i have a little girl that is obsessed with the Jonas Brothers, and I'm a big fan of Nickleback, and so i bought this album knowing it was a good choice. This is the one and only true Nickleback album, and i have since then purchased all of his other albums, and love them all. I can't recall a single song on this album that i don't like, I guess that's because I've never heard his music in it's entirety, it's just the songs that are on this album that i love. I just hope that this was a great one and that he'll put out another one, because he will.

Amazon review: I purchased this album (along with a 1st edition copy of the Nickleback book) by accident while going through my old CDs. I'm not really a Nickleback fan by any means, but the one album that I can't get enough of is the "No Tour" album. Now, most if not all Nickleback fans would probably disagree with me on this, and probably say that there is nothing on there that I don't like, but I really don't care. I just like the music, and I don't mind that he was signed to a label that's owned by his former management. This album is one of my favorite albums of all time. I love the music, and I love the lyrics. The best album of Nickleback's that I've ever heard, and I'm pretty sure that this is the best album that he will ever put out. I'm totally biased, because I've never heard the album, but I've always loved the songs.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I was in the audience for the Busted Open performance of this song.  It was quite a good show.  When I went to the website, I saw that the song was listed as a single.  I can't believe that.  I don't understand it because I am not a big fan of the band.  I understand that the song is from the new album.  But, it is a B-side or a B-side is a single.  I don't understand why it is a single.  I don't understand what the name of the CD is.  I don't understand why it is on the singles rack.  I don't understand why it is "live" at the beginning of the show.  I don't understand why it is not listed on the album.  I don't understand why it is listed on the album as "B" side.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: A typical "I have my life together" type of song.  It's a "let's take a break" song sung by a man who sounds like a drunk on a street corner.

It's a "let's take a break" song sung from the point of view of a drunk man on a street corner.

Amazon review: This is a very boring song.  It's a "let's take a break" song.  It's about a girl who has taken a break from life and is not ready to get back to it.

Amazon review: I don't think this song is a good song.  I'm in a funk and can't think of any positive phrases to say about it.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

The first track is "Love and Affection" is pretty much a love song that is written by the singer of the song. It's just perfect!
This song is a very good song by Roger. It's almost like he's just reading a love poem from the Bible.
This song is a must-have! It's a great song!

This is a great song by Roger Waters. It reminds me of "A Certain Smile", but it's much better.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The new version of this song is even worse.  I thought it was going to be a new song.  I'll give this a 7 and think they should make it a single.  I know I'm going to hate the new version of this song but this is a classic song and I'm pretty sure the person who wrote it will be glad to know that I hated it.  The chorus is still the same.  "I can't go on anymore, I can't make up my mind, I can't make up my mind.  I can't go on anymore."  I know it's just a song but it still sucks so bad.  The fact that they changed the singer doesn't excuse the fact that this song sucked so bad.

Amazon review:  I don't like "Dance Tonight" I really don't like "Dance Tonight"... but I thought it was pretty cool to hear a new song with the same title.  I could tell it fit the style of this album.  It's kind of like a modern version of "Dance a Little Closer".  I know the song has a lot of things wrong with it but "Dance Tonight" is just a little bit better than the original version.  It's not that bad.  I still can't get over the fact that Ne-yo and the guy who sings the song, just sound like an old man who got a lot of money from an old man and can't sing a full measure of a song.  I don't get it.  I have a lot of respect for this artist.  I can't believe he has a career.  I can't believe he has a career at all.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I love the first 5 songs, they are good.  But once again, everything you hear after that is bad.  I guess it's the same feeling I get from this album (except the first 5 songs are good).  It's boring, predictable, and unimaginative.  I don't know why, I just can't get into it.  I love most of the other songs, but this one has too many songs that are terrible.  This is an album that should be released in the middle of a movie.  No, I'm not joking.

Amazon review: Very different album.  I thought she was going for a more rock & roll sound with this album.  But not even the same thing.  She has the right idea with this album. But it's totally different.  She sounds like she is living in her own fantasy world.  She sounds almost like she is singing to herself.  It's not a bad thing, but it feels like something that was made in a mad house.  The songs sound really boring, with no emotion.  I really love her singing.

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  The only good song is 'The Way Life Goes' and 'Nothin' On You' are the best songs.  She sounds very different from her last album to this one.  She sounds a little more mature and not as silly, like she was on her previous album.  She's still talented.  This album sounds like she is singing to herself.  I don't know.  I'm just not digging it.  It's not that the songs are bad, it's just that they don't stand out from the rest of the album.  She uses the same type of lyrics we've seen in all of her other albums.  There's nothing unique about this album.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a long time.  I started listening to it at the age of 7.  I'm a little older than that now.  I have a 10-year-old daughter, and she loves this album.  I think it's a good album, and the songs are very good.  The album doesn't have a lot of good songs, but it has some great songs.  I love the way the music is mixed.  It's very old-school, but it's very good.  My favorite song is "We Can't Go Home Again" and my least favorite song is "The One That Got Away."  I like most songs, but I don't like any of them.  The only good song is "Fooled Again."  The song has a good beat and a good beat makes me feel happy.  "Can't Go Home Again" makes me feel sad because it reminds me of the song "Goodnight, My Someone" by the Isley Brothers.  "The One That Got Away" doesn't remind me of the Isley Brothers.  "Don't Let Me Stay Away" reminds me of "The One That Got Away" by the Isley Brothers.  "I'd Rather Go" reminds me of "Don't Let Me Stay Away" by the Isley Brothers.  "I Wouldn't Be Here" reminds me of "I Wouldn't Be Here" by the Isley Brothers.  "The One That Got Away," "I'd Rather Go," "Can't Go Home Again," and "Don't Let Me Stay Away" are good.  "I Wouldn't Be Here," "Don't Let Me Stay Away," and "Fooled Again" are not good.  I don't know why I downloaded this album, but it's probably because when I was younger, I thought this album was very good.  But now I'm 25 years old, and I think the album is bad.  I don't like the song "Can't Go Home Again," I don't like the song "The One That Got Away," I don't like the song "Don't Let Me Stay Away," I don't like the song "I Wouldn't Be Here," or "Fooled Again."

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: "Hate Me" is on a short list of the best Christmas songs. It's a slow-burnin' ballad with a chorus that's more than a little catchy. It has a subtle message, that it's okay to be a little naughty and a little mean. It's also one of the best examples of the power of a chorus, which you can use to make the song stand out from the rest. The song is a great representation of how the power of a chorus can change the song.

It's a great song, but I don't think that that's why people love it.

I think the song has to do with the idea of people who've had to deal with bad things in their life. They find hope in the fact that they are still alive, and their lives are not over. Maybe they don't have a reason to be happy, but they do have the ability to sing and dance and laugh and cry.

I think that's really what people like about the song.

Well, I just wanted to know how this song is for you.

I have a lot of friends and family that are in this situation, and I like to think that I have a lot of friends and family that are in this situation, but I am still the happiest person in the world.

It's really sad that this song just happened to end up on my favorites list.

I've been trying to get out of my comfort zone, in every way.

When I was in high school I was a really social person, but I kind of got a little depressed in college and kind of got to a point where I was a complete wall of self-doubt. I was very depressed and very shy, and I did a fair bit of partying. I really couldn't get out of my own head.

I thought I was pretty good at keeping my head above water, but I realized in life that it had gotten pretty hard to do it. I still had a very difficult time, but I have been able to get out of my head a lot more.

I really wanted to write this song. I've been trying to find the right way to write and the right words to put in there. I think I have found them.

I don't know if it's going to be this song, but this song is going to be my favorite.

It's a song that I wrote about my life. I wrote the song about my mother, and I don't think I've ever written a song about my mother before.

I wrote the song about a year ago. I wrote it about how I am a very loving person, but there's a part of me that really doesn't like people. And I don't like people that don't like me. So, I hate myself.

I wrote the song about how my mother always pushed me to go to school and do things. She wanted me to go to school and try to be somebody, and then do things, and then go to school and try to be somebody else again.

I wrote the song about how I feel like I'm just not that nice.

I wrote the song about how I feel like I'm a horrible person.

I wrote the song about how I feel like I never should have been born.

Amazon review: I used to listen to music when I wasn't driving, so I don't know about being safe or not.  I had a CD of this song for years and loved it, but it has been out of print for years.  I have recently been introduced to this artist on YouTube, so I bought the CD.  However, I'm now having trouble with the CD.  I purchased the CD from Amazon.  It is a good CD, but it doesn't sound right.  I have listened to the CD for about an hour.  It has no sound quality, and it is full of static.  I have tried to download the song, but I don't know where it is.  I would like to save this song, but it doesn't want to listen to me.  I purchased this CD at amazon.com, and I'm very disappointed in the service, and it's contents.  I want to download the song, but am not sure where it is.  I'm not being a bother or anything.  I just want this song to be available again, and I'm hoping that Amazon will get it off their site.  That's all I want.  This is my only complaint.

This is a great album, and there's a lot of good songs on it, but I think I'll pass on it for now.

A new album from a very up and coming artist, and I think what makes this album so good is the production, and the fact that the artist is still so young, and so eager to do what he wants.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
