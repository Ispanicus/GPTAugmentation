Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I don't know how I feel about this song but here goes.  It's catchy, I like the lyrics but I don't really like the melody.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  It's not bad or good.  It's simply not for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my favorite of her music to date.  She writes songs that make me want to be a better person.  This song is especially good.  It's a great example of her power.  It's not my favorite of her music, but I find myself listening to it constantly.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song and was hoping to love it more, but I really have no idea why I didn't.  I like her voice, but I don't know if I like her much.  I have not listened to all of it yet because I had to wait for it to be released and I am not in the mood for it yet.  I don't like the video, I think it's stupid, and it's not really a good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song says something special about her.  I love her.  I wish I could have met her.  I would have loved for her to be my friend.  I'm not sure why she wrote this song.  I don't think it's a very good song, but I'm still listening to it.  I've been listening to it for a long time.  It doesn't matter.  I love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love her music.  She has an incredible voice.  I'm not a fan.  I don't like her music or her lyrics.  I've heard a few tracks and they have nothing to do with her voice.  I think this is her first release and I think she needs to be more focused on her music.  She needs to write more songs that are more personal to her.

Amazon review: I like this song, but I need a better song.  I think it's good, but it doesn't have enough of a hook and it's not like the rest of her music.  I think I need a better song.  I think it's a good example of her power but it's too long.  I like the chorus but don't know if I want to hear it over and over.  It's just not the best song for me.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: This is a song I used to love. Now I don't recall much about the song. I thought that it was catchy. But I will say I didn't remember a lot of it.

Maybe you can give me a song or two to listen to. I think I will just listen to the radio and the iPod.

Amazon review: I'm just a regular listener to the radio. The songs all sound the same to me. Maybe I am a little too old to appreciate the music in the way that younger people do. But I listen to a lot of the same music that I did when I was a kid. It's just the same songs that I like. I mean, I don't have a problem with these songs. I don't think they are any less valuable, or any worse than the music that I grew up with. I'd rather hear a new song than a song that I've heard on the radio for ages.

I feel like this is a very good album. There is a good variety of songs on here. My favorite songs are "What's the Deal", "Suspended" and "Don't Wanna Go". I think this is the best album by this band.

After going through the album I think it's alright. The songs are good, some are just slightly average and some are horrible. The only one I thought was good was "Suspended". The song is good, but it just doesn't work or fit with the rest of the album. Overall I think this is a good album, but not really my favorite.

This album is a very good album. I really like songs like "Don't Wanna Go" and "Suspended". The only thing I don't like is "What's the Deal". This song is not fun and I am glad that it's on there. This is my favorite song off of this album.

This album is a good album. There are good songs on it and some not so good. My favorites are "What's the Deal" and "Suspended" My least favorite is "Don't Wanna Go".

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs. The vocals are great and the song has a great flow. It is great that the artist is not afraid to use a lyric like "It's a girl...", as it is a great song. I would recommend this song, but you may want to make sure you have high quality speakers. The bass is a little low, but it doesn't make a difference.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of "songs that only country radio stations play."  I'll buy one if it is a good song.  I'm also not a fan of "song that no one plays in their house."  I don't believe it would be possible to get everyone to be tuned in to the radio in a house with three people.  Then another thing, I think most country songs are not "country songs."  They are pop songs.  The term "country music" is a misnomer and it is more like "Christian music," but that is a subject for another time.

I am listening to it right now and it just doesn't sound like a Slipknot album.  It sounds like a collection of songs from other bands.  The band had great music but didn't have any cohesion.  The vocals sound like they are coming from a different band than the rest of the material.  Even the song titles sound like they were taken from a different band than the other songs.  The songs sound like they are from a different style or genre than Slipknot.  They just don't sound like Slipknot.  I am disappointed with this album, but I am not giving it a bad rating.  It is a CD I can listen to or listen to again and again.  I just don't want to hear it again.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Slipknot. Just don't put it on your iPod or CD player.  I don't want to hear it.  I just don't want to hear it.

I was happy with the quality of the audio. The CD's are great for playing in the car. I would recommend these CDs to anyone who is considering buying them. I have them on my iPod and I have heard only positive things about them.

You can tell these guys are talented musicians. I am a fan and was very pleased with the review.

I purchased this album for my wife. She is not a big fan of the band but thought it was a good album and liked it. She liked the "I will survive" song. She is very happy with the CD's that I bought for her.

I've been a fan of this band since I was a little kid and I am very glad I purchased this album because I think it's a great album. I am very happy with the music. I would recommend this album to everyone that is into good music.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a little while now and I think it is a great album. There are several songs that I would call "classic" songs. Some of the songs are pretty hard to describe without sounding like a commercial. One thing I've noticed is that the lyrics are usually very similar to one another and it is almost hard to tell the difference between the music and lyrics. I like the fact that the music is very good, but I don't think it is "classical" music. I like the fact that they sing about different things. One song was about a girl and her boyfriend, and the other was about a girl and her parents. It gives you different perspectives. I've heard other songs that were very similar to the songs on this album, but I don't think that they are as good as this one. I've had no complaints other than the fact that some songs sound a little bit like commercial music, such as "Spin." If you want to listen to a really good rap song, listen to "Spin." The only song that I would call a "classical" song is "I'm Sorry." The reason I called this album is that the music is "good," but the lyrics aren't always so good, which is a little disappointing. I think that this is a good album, but I don't think it is very "classical." There are two or three songs that are better than this album. The songs are good, but the lyrics are not as good as the music. I don't know how to describe it, but I could use a "classical" album.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As I was listening to this song, I realized that it was the first song on the album that I had never heard before.  I was surprised at my own ignorance.

###
Amazon review: This song is not for everyone.  It's very slow and has a very "melodic" feel.  I know this because I listened to it several times, each time taking a new turn and getting so lost in the slow-motion groove my hands got sweaty.  I can't say I was disappointed though because I still enjoy the song.  I guess I am just not a fan of slow songs.  I love the song but I just can't see myself singing it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first slow song I have heard on the album.  In fact, this song sounds like it was recorded in a slow motion studio.  It's kind of a "so slow you can't believe it's still moving" song.  And it really is a song that takes a while to get to.  It's not a fast song, but it's definitely one that requires a good deal of patience.  I could listen to it forever.  It's a good song, but it's not my favorite on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard this song many times before.  I just don't know it all that well.  It took me a while to get the message and I was a bit disappointed when I realized that the chorus is about singing in a choir.  I don't know why I didn't remember it.  That's just the way I am.  I like a song with a little more soul and an emotional "message" to it.  This is not that song.

Amazon review: This song sounds like it was recorded in a slow motion studio.  It is a "so slow you can't believe it's still moving" song and I am pretty sure it is one of the most boring songs I have ever heard.  It is not very memorable and has a very boring melody.

Amazon review: This song needs a band with a more "rock" sound.  The song is very "melodic" and "radio" sounding.  It may have been recorded in a slow motion studio, but it still sounds like it.  It is very "radio" friendly and I think it is one of the best songs on the album.

Amazon review: Very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome.

Amazon review: Great song.  I had no idea she was Rob Shneider's daughter!

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: You know what got my attention?  It's not the songs.  It's the album cover.  I thought the whole thing was too close to the cover of Rob Shneider's other album.  The album cover was a little too "Rastafarian" and the name of the album was not even very descriptive.  I guess I just don't like that, I mean I don't like that he's got horns on his album cover.  But, I'm not going to attack him for it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Just listen to the opening song, the one about the little girl getting burned.  You have to be there to appreciate that song.  It's so sad.  So sad.  I cried in the car listening to this.  I know it's not a sad song, but it's so perfect.  So perfect.  It's got the most perfect melody.  The perfect melody.  Like a song from a movie or something.  But I think it's just perfect.  The lyrics are perfect, the instrumentation is perfect.  The melody is perfection and the whole song is perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So in a nutshell, the Beatles wrote songs that made you cry and that were about the end of the world.  It's really a great song, and the lyrics are just as touching.  But, as I was listening to it, I started thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice if the Beatles wrote a song that made you cry, but wasn't about a world ending", you know?  And then, I realized that the Beatles did.  It's called "The Long and Winding Road". 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So, I really liked the album, but when I tried to listen to it again, to hear if there were any mistakes or anything, I thought, "Oh man, there's lots of mistakes!".  I thought, "I better buy this album, and then I can listen to it and do a second listen!".  So, I did.  I listened to it again and it was great!  Very good.  Very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great song, but the album is just too short.  A full album isn't very long.  It's just not long enough.  I think this song would be a great intro song for a lot of albums.  Great song.  Great song.  GREAT. 
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is really good.  I like the song, but I don't like the album.  There are too many songs, and they aren't very good songs.  I get bored with songs that I don't like.  Like, "I'm Going Home" is a very good song, but I don't like the album.  The other songs are just so boring. 
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was a complete surprise.  I didn't know the song before I listened to it.  I was very surprised.  I've never seen the album in the cd store before.  I don't understand why the music isn't played, but I love the song.  Very good song. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is definetly a good song.  I like the song.  It's not great.  But, it's not terrible.  It's just not great.  The song just won't do what I want it to.  I like it for what it is, but I don't think it's a great song. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to this album twice and I still don't know what it is.  I need to listen to it again.  I'm not crazy about it.  I like the song, but I don't think it's a great song.  I'm not crazy about it.

Amazon review: I actually really like the song.  I really like the song.  It is a really good song, but the album is too short.  I think it would be a good intro song for a lot of albums.
