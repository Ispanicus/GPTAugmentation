Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: Given guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm was still a member of the band (the only original holdover at this point), I guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as The Blues Magoos.  That said, like the predecessor set (1969's "Never Going Back To Georgia"), anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970's "Gulf Coast Bound" on their turntable.  Working with original Blues Magoos producer Bob Wyld, these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first ABC album.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this album less than a star. The charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good reviews on this garbage. Snake oil salesman Josh Feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple. Josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure. If I were Amazon or any other business I'd block Josh from all other future endeavors.

Amazon review: As I got older, I began to realize that my music tastes had changed. I had always been a fan of the blues, but I had no idea what I was listening to when I was a teenager.  I was listening to the Blues Magoos with some of my friends on the weekends, and I was blown away, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  I finally figured out what was going on, or at least what was going on to me, when I heard this album.  I was listening to some of the best blues ever, and the guitars were tight and the songs very heavy.  This is not a bad album, but it is not a good one.  I am disappointed by this one, but if you can take the good and the bad, you'll find this album one of the best ever.

Amazon review: This is the third ABC album released by the legendary Chess Records.  By this point, ABC had broken up and the band had been replaced by a new lineup consisting of guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm, bassist Bill Rieflin and drummer Jimmie Haas.  This would be their final Chess release before their break-up.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has been called the first "Gulf Coast Blues" and "Gulf Coast Blues II".  I can't agree with either of those assertions.  You have to have a pretty good understanding of the Blues Magoos style of playing to get what this album is.  This is a very different album from the first and the third, but I consider it to be one of the best.  The band was working on some very good material at this time, but nothing that stood out to me.  I do like this one a lot, but I wouldn't call it one of the best.

Amazon review: The second of two ABC albums on the Chess roster, this is a fine example of the early period of that label's history.  The album was produced by Bob Wyld, who had produced the first ABC album.  The band was made up of guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm, bassist Bill Rieflin and drums' Jimmie Haas.  The band toured in support of this album for a short while, and it is a decent representation of the band's style.

Amazon review: This is the first ABC album to be released on Columbia Records.  The band was made up of guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm, drummer Jimmie Haas, bassist Bill Rieflin and guitarist Roy C. Bennett.  The band had been called the Blues Magoos, but with the addition of these four musicians, the group became known as the Blues Magoos.  The album was produced by Bob Wyld, but the band was only touring in support of it at this time.  The band's style is a much more aggressive rock & roll style than the first album, and the sound of the first is more bluesy.

Amazon review: I can't remember which year this album was released, but in about three weeks it was on the radio.  I was listening to this album, and in about three weeks, it was on the radio.  This is a very good album, but it is far from the best album ever.  This is the third ABC album released by the legendary Chess Records.  Their name changed to the Blues Magoos when they were played by the newly-formed group of guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm, drummer Jimmie Haas, bassist-Bill Rieflin and guitarist Roy C. Bennett.  The band had left the original name of The Blues Magoos in favor of its new name, and this album is a good example of what they were going for at this time.  The album was produced by Bob Wyld, and the band was only supporting it on tour.

Amazon review: This is an excellent album based on the title of the album.  The vocals on this album are so strong that I don't know if they can be called singing at all.  I have listened to this album several times, and it is still as good as the first.  The guitar playing is also very good, and the band is very tight.  I have listened to this album several times and I still find it to be one of the best albums ever.  The band was working on some very good material at this time.  When they got together, they just started playing and the idea of recording this album just took off.  I am not sure what their intentions were, but this album is a very good example of what they were going for at this point in time.  This is a very good album, but it is far from one

Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.

Amazon review: Stryper has been around for a long time and is one of the bigger bands in the Christian metal genre. However, this album is all about the band members. It's not the same old Stryper, but a band with all of their major influences. Evanescence's Amy Lee provides the vocals, while David Evans provides the guitar work and Dave Hull provides the bass. The songwriting of this album is pretty good, but the production is terrible and the guitars are too loud. That is, until the last track, which is the best song on the album.

It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: For our purposes, this album was just another album Randy "BTO" Bachman made for the band Trooper.  The title of the album is "BTO".  (We know it's not real.  We also know the album was not on the label).  The album was recorded on a four track, a four track, and four track, and then put together on eight track.  However, I must say that these songs are all very original and I have always loved their music.  The lyrics are very funny, and very creative.  The songs are very catchy, and very catchy, and there is no doubt that the songs and lyrics will bring a smile to your face.

I am not an expert in this field, but I believe that the following four songs are all part of an ongoing trend in Christian music, which I have been noticing in general.  They are all part of the "hippie/beach/lounge/blues" style that has gradually begun to dominate the Christian music industry.  I hope that you will give them a listen and decide for yourself.

Amazon review: Great cd. This is the only cd I have found with so many great songs on one disc. Usually there are a couple good hits along with average or below average hits. From start to finish this cd will have you saying " I have forgotten how great that song is". Definitely recommend to any 70s music fan.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review: Some great songs here, but I wish they could have been a little more original instead of trying to be the same old song over and over.  The only thing I liked was the beginning, but I was expecting more.  I'm not a fan of the songs on here, I like to listen to classical music.  I guess you could call them pop, but not the real pop, but the pop with a class.  One of the songs is more like a classical piece.  I liked what I liked about this CD.  I don't know what the point was if they can't change the lyrics or the music to make it more exciting.  The CD is good.  But the point is to go back in the past and listen to it without the CD and then to listen to it again with the CD.  The CD is a must have for me.  But I would get a hard time from the people at Amazon.  It's not that they have a bad product, but they are too busy trying to make a profit from you.  Maybe if they would have a little more time to listen to the CD and give it to you, you wouldn't have to go back into the past.  I'm not saying the CD isn't good, but it's not worth the ridiculous price.  But I like to shop around, so I will go back and listen to it with the CD.  All in all, I will be purchasing this CD.  I recommend it.

Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!  I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.

Amazon review: I'm not sure what to make of this CD.  It's a good CD, but it's not a big seller.  I listen to it mostly for Tom Waits, but it's a pretty good listen.  I've only heard two tracks of music, but I listen to CDs on a regular basis.  I've found this album to be more of a collection of Waits' other work.  The two tracks I have are pretty good.  The only real problem I have with this CD is that it's a bit on the heavy side.  I find that it's a bit too much of a pain to listen to in small segments.  I would recommend this CD for people who don't require an excellent listen.  For others, it's a nice listen.  The only bad track on this CD is that it's a little too short.

Tom Waits - I'm a Boy

Tom Waits - I'm a Boy

Amazon.com Description:

Tom Waits has always been a master of catchy tunes, but this new album may be his most personal. A few songs here and there will have you whistling to the tune of "Summertime Blues" or singing along with "Gloria". But there's also a song called "I'm a Boy" that sounds like the love child of The Beatles and The Beach Boys - a very intimate song that tells the tale of a boy, his love, and the heartache that comes with it.

Tom Waits - I'm a Boy

Tom Waists - I'm a Boy

Tom Waits is an American singer-songwriter whose first two albums, "The Man Who Sold the World" and "Live at the Matrix", were big sellers in the early- and mid-1970s. Waits's later albums were less commercially successful, and he is now best known as a solo artist.

I'd buy this CD, if I had it. I've heard it twice and it's a great album. I like his singing voice, and his voice is on point. He's an excellent songwriter, and this album is a great collection of some great songs, like "I'm a Boy", "I'm the Man", "

I was very excited to receive this CD the first day it came out, but after listening to it three times end to end, I felt bored. After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it. I hold out hope that the group makes a 4th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original two CDs so terrific.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: Yes, it's the song "I Love You, You're My Only".  I'm guessing this is a song you would like for a wedding or something like that.  It is a pretty good song, but I would have preferred something a little more upbeat.  Still, it is a decent song.  I think it is a nice addition to the set.

Amazon review: This is a very good song to listen to on the bus, at work or just about anywhere.  This is a great song for a wedding or something like that.  The only thing that might make me a little sad is that it should probably be a little closer in tempo.  The lyrics are almost always the same.  They are not as catchy as say, "Sweet Caroline".  I would have liked to have heard a little more variety in the lyrics.  I would say the entire song is a really good choice, but it does not have the best melody.

Amazon review: The band is not bad.  Unfortunately, this song is not very good.  It does have a decent chorus, but the melody is not one of the best on the CD.  The lyrics are not as memorable as say, "Sweet Caroline".  I would have preferred a little more variety in the lyrics.  I would say the entire CD is a really good choice, but it does not have the best melody and lyrics.

Amazon review: This song is a bit slow.  The only thing that could possibly make the song better would be if the song was a little faster.  The chorus is great.  I think the song is a great choice, but I don't think it is the best.

Amazon book review: This is a really good CD.  I love the song.  The only thing I have a problem with is the last verse.  When the band sings "Oh we'll be right behind you," it sounds like they are singing "Oh we'll be right behind you with the big sticks."  My daughter has a fear of snakes so I would like them to change that verse to something else.  Otherwise this is a great CD.  Thank you.

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I did not like this CD.  I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: I'm not sure exactly why, but this is one of those songs I always feel like I should say something profound about.  It's hard to explain why, but I just feel like everybody should know what this song means.  It really is a good song, and I think it's a great way to show how great of a musician Hank Williams was.  The best way I can explain it is to say that this song is about a man who loves God, he loves his family, but he's scared to death of letting people down and he will do ANYTHING to make sure he never breaks that promise.  You can really feel this man's love for God through his lyrics.  It's a great story.  You can tell he really loved God, he really loves his family, but he's scared to death of letting people down.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is simply a perfect example of a simple, honest, beautiful song.  I don't usually like songs like this, in fact I don't like nearly all of the songwriting I've listened to in my life, but I find this one so beautiful I could cry, I've listened to it so many times I know every word by heart and it makes me want to give this man the praise he deserves.  I wish I could play it for him, but he wouldn't like it.  I hope he likes it.

Amazon review: If I had the choice of listening to music by Hank Williams and one of the great English songwriters, I know which one I would choose.  I've been to concerts by both, and have listened to many of the tunes they've performed there, and I have to say that the man's genius is no mystery.  I've heard many of his songs on YouTube.  If you want to know why I say this, I always come back to this one song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song that people need to hear again and again.  It gives me a great feeling when I hear this one again and again.

Amazon review: I think I've had this song on repeat for the past 30 years.  It's hard to explain why, but for me it's the first song that I ever fell in love with.  It's the first song that I ever fell in love with.  It was at the age of 14, and I'd never heard anything like it before.  It's the first song that I ever fell in love with - and I think that's it.  It's the first song that my eyes saw, and that's what I was hooked on for the rest of my life.

Amazon review: I really like this song.  It's great to hear someone from humble beginnings who rose to great heights in music.  This song is about being true to yourself and about not trying to be something you are not.  It's about the people who don't know who they are and that's ok, because that's who you are.  It's a great message, and I recommend it to everyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've heard this song about 40 million times.  I thought it was about the best kind of life, but it was actually about the worst kind.  After listening to it, I realized that it's about being true to oneself.  The person who is not true to themselves is not a person to be loved.  The person who is true to themselves is the person who is never going to fail.  The person who is not true to themselves is the person who is never going to grow up.  The person who is true to themselves is the person who is destined to grow up and be a better person.

Amazon review: I've always been intrigued by the fact that the great man Hank Williams wrote so many songs by himself.  He was a man who had no one to write for, he wrote to himself.  I've always thought that was pretty cool.  I didn't realize that it was just as cool that he did it all himself.  It makes me wonder, what does it take for people to write their own songs?  How do they know what they're going to write?  What does it take for someone to write their own songs?

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a Felt fan from the beginning, but this is a bad track.  I understand that some songs are a bad attempt at a song, but this one really takes the biscuit.  I'm almost positive that I will not be purchasing any more Felt releases (except the other two, that is) unless they change the formula.  A bad song with bad production and a bad video are not cutting it for me.  This is just a waste of time and money.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Aesop since the beginning, but this is the worst music I have ever heard.  This CD is just a rip off to the '60's and '70's pop-rock.  There is nothing there.  It is just lame and not interesting.  I feel bad for the people who have bought these CDs, because they have probably spent money in order to enjoy them, but there is nothing to look forward to in the future.  You aren't going to get any more entertainment out of this CD.

Amazon review: Lyrically, "I'm a Heartbreaker" is a pretty catchy tune with some great vocal work.  The vocals are very very similar to the one in "Heartbreaker on My Mind."

Amazon review: I have bought three CDs of Aesop from Amazon.  In all three cases, the music is just average.  I don't know what happened to the label.  I have bought three CDs of this band, and have been disappointed in each of them.  I will not be buying any more of these CDs unless they start to improve.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I tried this CD to find out what the hell was going on.  I was very disappointed.  The vocals are okay, but the guitar playing is a complete waste of time.  This is not one of my favorite CDs.  I will not be buying any more Aesop CD's.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have had my eye on Aesop since the beginning.  I had been listening to them since the beginning, but I have not gotten around to buying any of their music.  Aesop does not have much of a songwriting credit, and they don't have a point of view or voice like other bands I have listened to.  I will not be purchasing any more Aesop music.
Sentiment: Negative
