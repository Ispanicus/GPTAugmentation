Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: I've been a big fan of Soul II Soul since I was about 10.  I have also enjoyed many other female singers, although none of them have the same soul and authenticity of Gloria Gaynor.  I was pleasantly surprised, too, when I discovered the original soul records by the Drifters.

Amazon review: The new single is called "Satisfaction" and it is a real classic soul song. I wish there was a real video of it or a good audio clip on youtube. It reminds me of the "You're a Wonderful You" by Patti Page.

Amazon review: This is a great song that not many people have heard, at least it was new to me.  I'm hoping it becomes a new song, because it has the same vibe that Janet Jackson had.  I did not know that was a popular song when I first heard it, and I was totally surprised.  It was very sweet and nostalgic. I did not know they were a real band, I thought they were a singer in a band named the Drifters.

Amazon review: The song makes good use of the Fender Rhodes electric guitar and the drum kit to create an authentic sound. The voice is very distinctive with a great use of the vibrato and the use of the falsetto is really good. As a bonus, the guitar solo on this song is great.

Amazon review: I have a feeling that this was a song that was made available to the public at the same time as the original.  I don't know why they wouldn't release it, but then again, it could be that it was too loud and they didn't want to upset the public.

Amazon review: This is the first song I have heard by a new member of the band.  It is very good.  I like the sound of the electric guitar, but I like the vocals even more.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I was just wondering how I got my downloads from you, that's for sure.  I've been using this site a lot lately.  I usually just put the song I want in my download list, and then go to download.  The problem is, for some reason, I can't seem to find any of my downloads.  I'm using Firefox, and it doesn't give me any of my old downloads.  I'm on the latest version of Firefox, so that shouldn't be a problem.  I've even tried to take the song I wanted, and upload it to the site itself, but it doesn't seem to be working.  Any ideas?  I've been using this site since it began, and really have no idea why it isn't working for me.

I have had problems with this site for a few month, I was hoping this would be resolved soon. But this is a problem I have with every site. It only works if you log in with your account. It was working before I changed my password.

This is a big problem, and I don't know if it's due to a lack of bandwidth or some other technical problem. I have been trying to download this song for about one week, and all I got was a message that my download is in progress. I tried to download several songs and the same problem occurs. I would like to be able to download this song, but I can't.

This is the worst website ever.. I had to go to another site to download this song. It has been an extremely frustrating problem for me. I have been trying to download this song for over a week now and have not been successful. Please fix this problem ASAP, it has been a real distraction.

This is the worst website ever.. I had so much fun looking for this song. I've been trying to download this song for over a week with no luck. It has been a real distraction. I'm disappointed and annoyed with you for something that is going to take me a while to figure out.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have mixed feelings about this.  I think this could have used a little more work, but the album is a good compilation of some very good country artists of the era.  If you're a Country music fan, you really need to check this out.  You can't go wrong with any of these artists.  They are all good artists and have great talent and songs.  If your album is not country, then it's a waste of your time.  I love these artists so much.  I would have rated this higher except for the song "No Time" which I didn't like very much.  It was a little too long, but I'm just not a fan of long songs.  It was a song that I couldn't get into.  It's a shame because it was a good song that wasn't bad enough to merit a lower rating.  

###

The best CD of the year by far.  It features a number of very talented singer songwriters, along with exceptional musicians who are true masters of their craft.  Each song on the album is a gem and brings back wonderful memories on any of these artists.  The CD is about 45 minutes long and each CD has a small booklet with liner notes and photos.  The CD is a must have for any country fan.  When you look to country music, you're often left with something similar to a "mash up" of different artists.  On this album, the artists are all different and the CD is a nice compilation of some of the best artists of the 1970's.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very good compilation album. I love that they have artists such as George Jones, Merle Haggard, George Strait, and Willie Nelson in the same album.  I think this is a very good album for anyone who loves the music of the 70's.  As a country fan, I love the variety of artists on this album.

###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good story, but I'm not sure this is it. It's a cute story, but the songs are just that. Not very memorable at all. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a big fan of Ne-yo in the first place or if it's because the songs are the worst I've ever heard, but the singing is just so bad, it makes the whole album a wash.

Amazon review: I just finished my first ever Ne-yo album. It's not a bad album. It's actually quite good. I think that it's a little bit different for him, but that's what is great about his style.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: This is a great song, but it is very overated.  It feels like a really average pop song, with too much flute.  When I first heard this song, I thought it was by Lady Gaga.  My wife saw this song and thought it was by Lady Gaga.  I just couldn't tell which album it came from, so I called up my wife and asked her which album it came from.  She said The Lady Gaga.  I said that doesn't ring a bell, so I asked her if she knew who the artist was.  She says "No.  I've heard this song before, but don't know who the artist is."  I said you're right, I don't know, so I asked if she knew who the artist was.  She said, "I just know it's a female singer."  I said, "I didn't know you could name a song after a song."  She said, "It's a great song."  I said, "No, it's not.  It's just a great song."  I could tell she didn't like it, so I asked if I could play it for her, so she could hear it for herself.  Before I could play it, she said it was a great song, so I didn't play it.  At that point, I was ready to go home, and I called up my wife and told her.  I couldn't tell her who the artist was, because she would just say that it was Lady Gaga (her favorite artist), and I would have to tell her that it wasn't.  I had to ask my wife if she knew who the artist was because she would be telling me to play the song for her.  She said "Oh, I just know it's a female singer."  I said "What do you know?"  She said that she thought they were a female duo.  I said, "That doesn't ring a bell, either.  I'll have to ask my wife."  She said, "Well, she said she thought they were a female duo."  I said, "Oh, great, I don't know who the artist is.  I'll have to ask my wife."  She said, it's a great song.  I asked her if she thought it was a male artist.  She said, "You know when you get a song and you can't figure out who the artist is?"  I said, "Yes.  That's called a great song."  She said, "Oh, good, I don't know who the artist is."  I said, "Well, she said they sound a little like a male duo."  I asked if she was sure, and she said, "Well, I thought they sounded a little like a male duo."  I asked if that was her favorite song, and she said, "Oh, she loved it."  Then I asked her if she thought it was from the same album as Lady Gaga, and she said, "No, I didn't know that was a female duo.  I thought they were a female singer."  I asked her if she knew who the artist was, and she said "No, I just know it's a great song."  I asked her if she thought it was a male singer, and she said, "No, she loved it.  I think she said she thought they sounded a little like a male duo.  I asked if that was her favorite song, and she said, she loved it.  I asked her if she thought it was from the same album as Lady G.  She said, "No, she didn't know that was a female duo.  I don't know who the artist is.  I'll have to contact my wife."  I said, "Well, she said she thought they sounded a little like a male duo."  I asked her who she thought it was, and she said, "I don't know.  I'm not going to tell you who the artist is."  I asked her if she thought it was from the same album as the Lady Gaga album, and she said, "No.  I don't know who the artist is.  I'll call my wife and ask her."  I said, "Well, she said it sounded like a male duo."  I asked if her favorite song was Lady Gaga, and she said, "No, she didn't know that was a female duo."

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very much a music fan, but this collection is like a bucket of cold water.  There are no surprises, nothing that would make you think, "Hey, I didn't know that before!"  If you want your kids to like music, buy this.  I am an old soul, and I enjoy what I like, but this just isn't it.  It's just not an album.  Unless you have an old soul like me, you will probably just skip it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album of music that I would want to listen to.  Unfortunately, the album is very poorly recorded.  It's hard to hear the vocals and the music is very loud.  Sometimes, the sound is too loud, making it difficult to hear the instruments, particularly the drums.  I have listened to this album many times, but I still always thought that it was recorded with a home studio.  The album sounds like the music is recorded in a studio with an extremely expensive microphone.  It's definitely worth the money, but I would definitely recommend that you buy the vinyl rather than the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is very nicely recorded, but the vocals are very poor, and the music is very loud.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.

Amazon review: I find the last two tracks on this album to be quite disturbing. The vocals on "Fools in Love" are atrocious, the lyrics are depressing and make me wonder if you take medication for depression. The songs "I Don't Want to Be the One" and the title track are quite good. I would recommend this album, but would recommend to get a therapist and not a DJ.

Amazon review: I love this album! I bought it a month ago and still play it. It has great songs that get a lot of air-play and then they have the amazing songs that go unnoticed. The album is very good and the lyrics are very good as well. It is also very enjoyable, very entertaining and you can't help but smile when you hear it. I love this album!

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: This is a collection of remixes and mashups by other artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, The Who, Metallica, Pink Floyd, Metallik, The Cure, and others. As far as the mixing goes this album sounds similar to what one would expect from a mashup album. The remixes sound like nothing else out there. This album is a great resource for all those who have an interest in remixing and mashups.

Amazon review: One of the best albums of the year by any of the "F" group: The Flaming Lips. The fact that they have put out a song that is so well put together and has a message that is very pertinent to today's world makes it all the more essential. I like to think that the "F" group is the band that can make it with any genre of music but they manage to stay true to their own style, which is very unique. I enjoy this album very much.
