Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have had this CD for a few years now and it's one of my favorite CDs  ever.  I think that it is very true that it is a great song  and it was a good choice to put out a CD of the kind with "Amazing Grace".  I don't know why some critics  seem to like it but it is a good song  with a sound that is very true to what we all know  about the Gospel.  I am pleased with this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD  in July, 2004 I thought the song was beautiful and I really enjoyed it.  I had not listened to it all the way through when I first received it, and I did not listen to it when I took it back in November because I was waiting for this CD to come in the mail.  After about a year later I opened the package and found that I had lost the CD, I called and asked the store I got the CD from if they had a copy of this CD, the store told me they had a copy, but I didn't have one with me then and they told me that the store had lost the CD and that they would send me a copy.  So I got the copy and I played it for my family and I was very pleased with it.  I really like this CD  and I thank God for giving me this CD.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I don't know if I can say much more but I just wanted to say that I'm enjoying this album a lot more than I thought I would. I was a little scared after listening to the two other Pink Floyd albums I had (The Wall and Wish You Were Here) because I thought they might be just a bit too dark and depressing. I have always thought that the music was so dark and depressing and I just couldn't see it. But I am enjoying this album more as well as the live concerts.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen is one of the best singer-songwriters in pop music.  Some of his songs are so good, they don't even have to be written.  I've been listening to this CD for months, and it has only improved with time.  The best place to find this album is Amazon.  You can also get it from iTunes for cheap.  You'll love this CD.  I love Leonard Cohen.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This album has a good mix of songs, but some of them just don't grab me.  I guess I don't like the songs, and I don't like the message.  I also didn't like the album cover.  The music isn't as good as the first season, but it's not bad.  The songs are good, and the performances good.  I guess some of the songs were better, but that's subjective.  I prefer the original soundtrack and would prefer to have a full CD out of this season (or at least season 2).  I also think the theme songs should be the same as the theme songs of the original soundtrack.

Amazon review: This album is pretty good.  I like the first season and it's not as good as the original soundtrack, but overall I think it's pretty good.  The songs are good and the performances are good.  I'm not sure how I feel about the theme song.  Either way, I like it.  I would like to see these songs played in the original movie, but I doubt they will ever be.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked it, but the album itself wasn't that impressive.  They didn't really do anything to change anything that I didn't like about the original, so I felt the album didn't do much for the original film.  They did keep the soundtrack somewhat similar to the original, which I like, so I won't be complaining (but I still didn't like the album as much as the original soundtrack).  I would have much preferred if they released just the original soundtrack, but I guess they had no choice.  I would still recommend this album to fans of the original movie, or fans of the original film who are diehard fans.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good album.  I enjoyed it but it's not as good as the original soundtrack.  I think the original soundtrack is better, but it was a long time ago, and I didn't think they could have done much better than the original soundtrack.  I would have liked to have seen them release just the original soundtrack, but it's not really up to me to criticize, so I'll just recommend it.  I also didn't like the theme song, but I guess I'm not the target audience for the original soundtrack.  I think I would have preferred if they released just the theme songs of the original soundtrack, but it's not really up to me to criticize.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I love this band.  They have a great sound.  They do a lot of cover songs and some original songs.  This CD is their debut LP, which I don't care for.  I can't understand why this band is so popular.  I mean most of their songs are cover songs.  I think the music is great and they have great vocals.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: I love the sound and it's so easy to play. I was looking for an instrument that would make my music different. I guess I was wrong.

And I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to use it. I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review, by Amazon reviewer: This is a great little instrument.  It's nice and light to carry and the sound is amazing.  It has a pretty little pan flute that's a really big hit when you play it.  It's just a really easy to use instrument.  
I would recommend it if you want that little bit of extra sound.  But I would not recommend it if you are looking to get really good music out of it.  I found the instructions to be very poor.  The instructions are written in Japanese, but the pictures are in English.  The instructions are just confusing.  
I would recommend this to someone who loves to play the "bad" instruments.  I would recommend this to someone who wants to play traditional music.  But I would not recommend this to someone who wants to play a really good instrument.  I would recommend this to someone who likes to play the "normal" instruments.  I would not recommend this to someone who likes to play the "good" instruments.  
I would not recommend this to someone who likes to play the "awesome" instruments.  I would recommend this to someone who likes to play the "awesome" instruments with a little extra kick.  I would recommend this to someone who likes to play the "bad" instruments with a little extra kick.

The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

Amazon review: I was a Bronn Journey fan from my teens. I was a little late to the game but I'm glad I waited. I've listened to it a few times since then. But the first time I heard this album I was blown away. I loved the song "I'm Sorry" and I think the other songs really stood out to me. I still have it on CD. I think the songs stand up nicely on the CD. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes music with a great message. I wish I could find the original artwork for the album. It's a little hard to find...
