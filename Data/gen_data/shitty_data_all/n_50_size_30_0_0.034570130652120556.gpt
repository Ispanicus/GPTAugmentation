Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Blues for You - Robert Johnson
Reviewer: Mark, from the UK

I have to say that not many people know Robert Johnson, as it was only mentioned in the last five years. Robert Johnson was a blues singer, and a man, whose music was known across the world.

When he lived in Memphis, he met and married Zilphia Turner and they had three children, Robert Jr, Jimmy and Bobby.

In the 1930s, he performed in clubs around the United States, but he also performed in clubs in Europe, and he also toured the United States. Robert Johnson was known for his ability to make people smile, and he was known for his music. He was also very popular because of his singing. He lived a very quiet life.

He died in 1959, but is very well known to the world.

Amazon review: the words say it all. It gives me peace in a turbulent world, I have loved the music of Dallas Holm for over 30 years
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Music CD reviews from the USA

Taken from the Amazon Music US reviews site

This album is probably the best songwriting in all of music. This is a song which is basically a love song but it is written in such a way that you can take the lyrics and apply it to a situation and make it your own. The message is right there in the title - 'The message is right there in the title'.

So, for example, lets say you are having a problem with someone and you want to write a song about it and then apply it to society. You can use the following lyrics to a song titled: 'You can use the following lyrics to a song titled:

'A man went to town

to get a beer

He walked into a bar...'

and then you can use the following lyrics to make it a song about a man who went to town to get a beer and then walked into a bar and he walked into trouble and he walked out of the bar and he walked into a problem... and he walked out of the bar and he walked into a problem...

This is a song which is basically about love. The message is right there in the title and you can definitely use the following lyrics to make this a song about love.

'A man went to town

to get a beer.

He walked into a bar

to get some sugar

He walked into a bar

to get some money

He walked into a bar...'

In this song, you can use the following lyrics to make it a song about love.

'A man went to town
to get a beer.
He walked into a bar to get some sugar.
He walked into a bar to get some money.
He walked into a bar to get some dough.
He walked into a bar to get some money.
He went to town to get a beer.
He walked into a bar to get some sugar.'

This is a song which is basically about love. The message I just gave you is the same message that the song is about.

'A man went to town

to get a drink.

He walked into a bar

to get some whiskey.

He walked into a bar

to get some money.

He walked into a bar

to get some dough.

He walked into a bar

to get some money.'

This is a song which is basically about love. The song is just as much about love as it is about the man who is trying to get a drink.

'A man went to town

to get a few drinks.

He walked into a bar

to get a few drinks.
He walked into a bar

to get a few drinks. He walked into a bar

to get a few drinks. He walked in a bar

to get a few drinks. He walked in a city

to get a drink. He walked into a bar

to get a drink. He walked in a bar

to get a drink.'

This is a song which is basically about love. It is about the man who is trying to get a drink and it is about the woman who is trying to get the man to get a drink.

'I had to get a drink.

I had to get a drink.

I had to get a few drinks.

I had to get a few drinks.

I couldn't get a

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I've been a Twiztid fan for a long time and I've always loved the way they wrote their lyrics and that they have the ability to pull a great melody over to a great groove.  This album is a step back.  The new songs are dull and the old ones are good.  They've thrown out all the ideas and the old song structures and it sounds like the production has been redone.  They've gone for the cheap route and have thrown in some of the worst choruses I've heard in a long time.  It's like they're trying to prove something to their parents and they're trying to impress everyone by sounding like Eminem.  I wish Madrox would just do all the voices in one album and they would be able to at least make them sound like they're not the same person.  It's all bland and mediocre.
Sentiment: Negative

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The best thing about this cd is the music.  I am a huge fan of  New Orleans music.  This cd is great and the music is great.  The band is good and the energy is good.

Amazon review: I am a regular listener to the radio and the  only music I like is jazz.  I have never seen any of these guys  perform.  I went out to see Mr. Lips at an open mic night in the  area and they were so good, I thought they were better than the band I had heard.  I was wrong.  They were great.  The music was good but the band was really good too.  This is a must have for any fan of New Orleans music.

Amazon book review for The Glory of the Lord songbook: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshippers Arise' this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear praise and worship and conversation toward Him. He loves us, I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the others. I have shared the one song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian sisters during our monthly Christian sister's gathering ministry meetings. They all love this songs.

Amazon review: To be honest, this thing is a real disappointment.  I've been a fan of his since I was about 12 years old.  The songs I listed here are just not any good... I'll leave it at that.  If you are a Clint Eastwood fan this is a definite no.  I am giving the album 5 stars but if you are a Clint fan that's 5 stars.  I'll give it a 6 if it's a Clint fan. Otherwise, I'd give it a 3 or less, and I wouldn't give it a 5.

Amazon review:  This is the album that made me want to go to college and major in music.  I used to live in College Station, Texas and played in the College Station band.  I played in a band with a really tall guy with long hair that played guitar for a while, I loved playing with him.  He was pretty good, but it was his hair I loved.  He used to be a drummer for the University of Texas and he used to play drums for the University of Texas and he used to play drums for the University, but he had long hair so I told him to cut it off and he played with some other guys.  I didn't know he played drums for the University until we played for the University of Texas.  I asked him about it and he said he played with the University of Texas for about 10 years.  I said that's great, and he said he was in a band that played at the University of Texas for about 30 years.  He played trumpet in the band.  I said that's great, and he said he played with the University of Texas for about 10 years at one time.  I said that's great, and he said he played with a band that played at the University of Texas for about 30 years at one time.  He played in a band called The Hogs.  I said that's great, and he said that's where I met my wife.  Then he played with the University of Texas for about 10 years at one time and I asked him about the University of Texas and he said he played with them for about 30 years at one time.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The first thing I have to say about this album is that it's not as good as the first two.  I'm a fan of A.I. and the first two albums are not my cup of tea.  I don't like them because they are too generic and too uninspired.  This album has a lot of great tracks and you can really tell that this album had a lot of planning.  It's a very good album and worth it's price.

Track Listing
1 - The Good Fight
2 - The Man Who Loved Us
3 - The Way I Am
4 - Open Your Mouth & Sing
5 - I Can't Take No More
6 - I Remember Me
7 - Where Are You Now
8 - I Can't Help It
9 - I Can't Help Falling in Love
10 - You're Still Here

18 - I Need You Now
19 - I Wish You Were Here
20 - Don't Worry 'Bout Me
21 - I Am the Walrus
22 - I Am the Walrus (Reprise)

This is a very good album and worth the price if you like them a lot.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

Overall, I've always had a love for T.H.E.M.  It's just one that doesn't get out as much as it could.  I don't think that it's a bad album, on the contrary, it's quite good.  I just feel that the first two albums have a lot more to offer.  As far as the album goes I would recommend it.  I'm a fan of the first two albums and I feel that this one has more to offer.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I got this when my sister was visiting.  I loved it.  My sister loves it and says it's the best CD she's ever heard.  I have had it for about 2 months.  I was just very sad when I realized it would be the last CD I would get from her.  I would hope she could sing it with me for the last time.  She says it's the best CD she's ever heard.  This song is the only one that I have ever heard on the CD that would make me want to get up and dance.    When I am with my family, I will sing this song and then ask them to dance.

Amazon review: I was amazed with this album and will try to buy the whole CD.  I am looking forward to it.  I loved it.  I feel like he is a great singer and I have been singing his songs all my life.  I know they are written by him and I am sure that he is a great singer, but I'm not sure exactly why the album is better because I haven't heard any of his other CD's.  When I was a kid, I would listen to the old black and white movies and I heard his songs on the radio alot and I just loved them.  I was in a band that was named after him and we would have shows every weekend and I would always have the same song playing and I would always have to go back to listen to it again.  I couldn't understand why he wrote other songs.  I have listened to this album many times and I don't think I have ever been bored with it.  I would listen to the song "Good as You" over and over again and would love to have a song by him playing when I am alone.  He is a very good singer and I would love to see him play live.  I don't think that I would ever buy an album, but if I had to choose one, I would pick this album over any other.

I'm a big fan of his, but I think this is his best album.  I hope that he writes more songs like this.  I am a huge fan of him, but I love every song he has written.  I hope that he writes more of them.  I don't like the song "Good as You" because I think it's really boring, but I love "The Secret Life of the Heart" and I love the way that it ends.  I love his voice, I love his songwriting and I love the way that he sings.  I can't wait for his next CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

A:

I don't use Amazon as a buying site; I only have Amazon with my credit card. 
I have been reading a lot of reviews, and I can't really see any problems with the songs, but I can see some problems with the album cover. It says "Casting Crowns" in the lower left corner, and some people have complained about that. If you download the album to your computer and then open it with iTunes, you'll find the cover is a bit off, but it's hard to tell unless you have the album in front of you, and the cover is still on the cover. 
The only thing I can see that's problematic about the album is that I have the album in front of me, and it's still on the cover, and it's not the right cover, but I can't see what I could have done differently to get it right.

 I download the album to my computer, and I find the album cover is still on the cover. The cover was a bit off for me, but I don't know what could have been done to fix it. But I downloaded the album to my computer, and the cover is still on the cover. 

If you are downloading the album to your computer, you'll have to download the entire album to your computer; you can't just download parts of the album. 

I am a fan of the album, and I downloaded the entire album to my computer, and it's still on the cover. 

I don't know if the album was purchased as a download, but it's been purchased as a download, and it's still on the cover. 

I have two copies of the album, and I don't know where the first copy of the album is. I can't see any problems with the album. 

I think this album is fantastic.  I download the album to my computer, and the cover is still on the album.  I have the entire album, and I don't see any problems with it. 

Thanks so much for reading this.  I hope this helps you.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this album, or anything else.
