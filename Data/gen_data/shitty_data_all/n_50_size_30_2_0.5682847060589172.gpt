Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

You could try playing the chords twice and then singing them over and over. The song does not necessarily need to be sung over and over.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This record is going to be a "hit" on the hip hop scene. It is very catchy and is definitely going to be a hit.  The album is great and will be a hit with the rap community.  I love the song "Hail Mary" and the beat made me want to jump up and down and dance.  The "Hail Mary" is a great song and the beat is a great beat. "Hail Mary" was the single and the video was a huge success. The video was a success.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  The first track is the best.  "The Beat Goes On" has a real nice beat to it.  "I Can't Believe It's True" is a great song that was a hit with the ladies.

Amazon review:    I have been waiting for this to come out for a long time and I am happy to say that I am happy that I got it.  It is very different from everything else I have heard from 2 Live Crew and it is very good.  I love that the record has an instrumental break at the end of each song.  I really like how the album has the instrumental breaks.   I highly recommend the album to anyone who wants a more "alternative" pop sound.    I will continue to listen to the album for a long time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I LOVE this album but I have to be honest I would rather hear the same songs on different songs.  This I can understand but it just makes me feel very uncomfortable to hear the same songs over and over again.  The lyrics for "Hollywood" are very good and the song is actually good.  "Get On Tha Train" is better than the song that was on the original.   The beat on "Hollywood" is better than the beat on the original.  "Hollywood" and "Take Me Away" are the best songs on the album.   The beat for "Hollywood" is better than the beat for the original "Hollywood" which was better than the original "Hollywood" which was better than the original "Holly" which was better than the original "Holly" which was better... I can go on and on.

"Dirty Money" was better than the original and "I Don't Like You" was better than the original.   I am glad that I bought this album.  I like it.  I like the songs very much.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: So let me get this straight, this is a collection of songs written by one person? I don't know... I was kind of expecting a collection of songs by, say, the original members of Nirvana. If I were to be completely honest, the only reason I have bought the entire disc is because of the 'Kiss Me Like a Rock Star' remix, which, incidentally, I had heard years and years ago, and which I would love to hear if it was done again. In short, this is a great record, I just wish it wasn't the most expensive one I've ever purchased.

Amazon review: This is the same artist, but it's just another artist. This is a CD of music by the cast of the original Broadway cast. I've listened to this CD at least twice, and it is sooooo beautiful!! It reminds me of listening to the Broadway cast sing the songs from "West Side Story"!! I've been searching for a CD of music from the Broadway cast of "West Side Story" for a long, long time. I've been listening to the same artists and music for a long time. I'd say that I've listened to this artist for at least 10 years, but I don't know how long it's been since I've listened to him. I've been very disappointed in the music I've been listening to for the last year, but this is different. He really does have a wonderful voice. I've listened to this CD for almost 2 years now, and I still can't quite believe I've been listening to this artist for 10 years. When I first heard this artist, I thought it was a very strong artist, in my opinion. I wasn't sure if he'd ever come back to the music scene, but he did, and he's come back again. I could go on all day about this artist, and I will. But I think this song says it all: "I love you all so much, I love you all so much..." This song is very beautiful. I think this artist is so important to American culture, that we can't forget him. So I hope this artist comes back and plays the music that he used to play when he was young. I think this song is a song that would be in the American songbook.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this song.  I really liked it...and now I know why I did not like it.  Its not bad, but it is just not up to par with the rest of this album.  The vocals are just too high pitched and the bass is too low...and it does not fit the theme of the album at all.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have to disagree with the Amazon reviewer.  I have always liked her from her first song.  Her voice is gorgeous.  She has a unique style.  It's not what is says.  I will say that the music is different from what I am used to.  And that's okay.  I don't mind.  She is still an incredibly talented singer/songwriter.  The only problem with this CD is that she just doesn't sing.  Not in that way.  She just sings her heart out.  She doesn't sing with her voice.  Her voice is so beautiful but her voice is not the voice that I like.  I've listened to the CD a few times.  I have to say that I prefer songs that are more personal.  She's good.  But I just don't care about the lyrics.  I just don't get the whole point.  I really don't like that song.  And what does it have to do with anything?  I don't like it.  I hate it.  I don't even know what it means.  It's just not the type of song I like.  I really don't understand what the song is saying.  It's just not right.  I would hate to be her audience.  I don't know.  I don't like it.  And I just don't understand why anyone would listen to her albums.  I just don't get it.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  I don't get nothing.  I just don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Why would I listen to this shit?  I just don't get it.  I just don't get nothing.  I just don't get it.  Why would I listen?  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand.  Why would I listen?  I just don't understand.  I just don't get it.  Why would I listen.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand it.  I just don't get it.  I just don't see it.  I just don't see it.  I just dont get it.  I just don't understand.  I just don't get it, I just don't get it  Why would I listen.  I just don't get it.

Amazon review: I don't know much about the songwriter or the artist.  I don't like the song.  It's probably the worst song ever written.  It sounds like the singer sang the lyrics with a voice synthesizer or something.  I really don't understand the lyrics.  I don't get it.  But I like the music.  I like the voice.  The only problem I have with this song is that it doesn't have a chorus.  And most of the songs on this album have a chorus.  The only songs that don't have a chorus are the two songs that have a chorus.  Just because they don't have a chorus doesn't mean that they have one.  I really don't understand the lyrics.  I don't care.  I don't like the song.  I like her voice.  I like the music.  I like her style.  I like the music.  I like her style.  The only problem is that it doesn't have a chorus.  The album is interesting.  I just don't get it.  I don't get the whole point.  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it.  I don't understand it at all.  I don't get it.  I don't get it at all.

Amazon review: I have never been one for the radio, but this song is a good listen.  This song is about the love between a man and a woman. I think the song is kind of cute.

Amazon review: I got hooked on this song.  It made me feel like I was getting to be apart of something bigger and better than myself.

I think that people should listen to the lyrics and not the music.  I think maybe if they listened to the lyrics, they would feel more connected to the song.  The music is really good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a very good album with some of the best lyrics you'll ever hear. I really enjoyed the album. The only problem is that they don't have the ability to make the music sound good in clubs. There is no real rocking or heavy metal sound.

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best albums of the last ten years. The lyrics are really good and the music is excellent. It has a dark sound and a heavy metal sound that is very well done.

There is not much energy in this album and it didn't make me want to listen to it again. I think that this album can be enjoyed by older teenagers and should appeal to younger teenagers.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would like to add to my review of Libera. They are a great band that is very well balanced. They have the ability to sing, play the instrument, and write a great song.

Still, I have to say, it is really bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know this was only released on cd, but I still like it.  I remember the first time I heard Twiztid, I was 15 years old and it was the first album I had ever heard by a male rapper.  I was a huge fan of Eminem and Tupac, but this guy was a new one on me.  He was just starting out, but I still was not impressed.  I listened to it in my car and on the way home I was like, "You need to put more raps in this, this is just the most boring rap album ever.  It's like a compilation album.  You can't just leave out 2 minutes of rap and still call it an album!"  So I listened to it again and again.  Only now, I'm an old man and I find that this album is a huge step forward compared to what I was hearing when I was younger.  Now, I can't just leave out a full minute of rap and call it an album.  The album is not bad, it just isn't very good.  I did not like this album as a kid because it wasn't as good as what I was expecting it to be, but now as an adult, I can't help but think that this album is a big step in the right direction.  The album had a lot of good songs and it shows that Twiztid is trying to be better than him.  The problem is, the songs are boring and there are no good songs.  I am just disappointed and I don't know what to think anymore.  I don't want to hear about the album anymore because I was getting sick of hearing it.  It's over!

Amazon review: I liked this album as a kid.  This album is really a step in the right direction for Twiztid.  It is good music and it is original.  I listened to it last night and thought, "I like this album."  It is a step in the right direction for Twiztid.  As an adult, I can also see why this album is a step in the right direction.  But it is still really a step in the right direction.  I have listened to and been a fan for years now, so why did I like this album as a kid and now as an adult?  The answer is that I like this album.  I still like it, but I am just disappointed because it is not as good as I thought it would be.  It is not bad, but it is not good either.  There is not a whole lot of variety and the songs are just not that good.  They are just a whole bunch of dull rap verses.  The song "The One" is my favorite song on the album and it is not a bad song at all.  The problem is that there is not much variety and there are not a lot of good songs.  There is just one good song and it is not enough to keep me listening to the album.  The song "Rise" is probably the best song on the album, but it is not enough to keep me listening to the album.  There are not a lot of good songs and the best song on the album is not enough to keep me listening.  I would have to say that I would not buy this album again.  I would like to hear more music from Twiztid, but not like this and not like this is what I want to hear.  I would like to hear more music with more variety and more good songs.  I would be even more disappointed if this album was on a cd.  I would like to see more good music from Twiztid, but not like this.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album will make you cry, laugh, and wish you could talk.  The voices of the children in this album are so powerful that you will cry and feel happy all at the same time.  There are many different types of music in this album, but all of them are very emotional and powerful.  The voice of the conductor is a wonderful addition to the album.  If you like children's music, this is the album for you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I had high hopes, but this album is disappointing.  The songs are all fantastic, and I still love most of them, but the albums does nothing for me whatsoever.  A lot of the songs in this album are pretty well known, but not all of them.  The ones that aren't are still great, but the album as a whole is disappointing.  At first I was excited, but now I'm not really sure why I bought it.  I do wish I had bought it because I would have gotten a CD with all of the songs in one package, but I have so many other CDs that I feel I should buy, and I just don't want to buy so many CDs.  I can't understand why this album is so popular, because it's just not a good album.  It's sad but it's also a waste of money.

Amazon review: I thought I would be able to enjoy this album because I'm a big fan of Meghan Trainor.  It's just not to me!  She is a talented singer and composer, but she doesn't write songs that I like.  I could say this is a "negative" review, but I think I should explain more.  I'm a huge fan of her voice and I'm not really a fan of her music.  It's not that she doesn't write good songs, it's that she doesn't write songs that I like.  I think she is a talented singer, but I think she should write songs that I like.  I like her voice, but I don't really like her music.  It's sad, but I can't explain why.

Not only was Meghan Trainor able to write several of my favorite songs, I was also pleasantly surprised by her ability to write a variety of music styles.  I am a huge fan of her voice, but I also look for different types of music to listen to.  So far this album has been one of my favorites.  It's a different style of music, but it still has the same emotion that I like to listen to.  I love the diversity of the songs.  Meghan Trainor is an incredible singer.  She has an amazing voice.  Thank you Meghan!

They are not quite like the ones that I have heard before.  Meghan Trainor has a great voice, but she doesn't write songs that I really care to listen to.  I am giving this album a 3 out of 5.  I don't have much to say about the songs because it's not that I have never heard them before.  I just like the way the songs have been put together.  I like the different

"Good Old Days"

"One, Two, Three"

Amazon review:  This was my first purchase on Amazon and I am so glad I did.  I am one of those people that don't like rap, but this song by the T-Wayz is a must have for any hip-hop fans.  I don't get the people who say that they don't like rap because they are "not that good" or they "don't rap", but this is not true.  This is a great song, and it deserves a higher rating than it currently has.  It is hard to find someone that raps, or at least raps well enough to stand out from the crowd.
