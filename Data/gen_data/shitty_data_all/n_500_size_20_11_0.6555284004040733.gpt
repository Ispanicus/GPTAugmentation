Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: What can I say.  It's Billy Joel.  The album is fantastic.  I think it's one of his very best albums.  The first 3 songs are great.  I like them all, but they all suck in a certain way.  They are all so cheesy and repetitive.  The album ends with "I'm a King Bee."  The last song is very nice, it's just too short.  I can't believe he has a hit with that.  It's a great album, it's just too short.  It's a good effort, but it doesn't stand up very well to the great songs on this album.  It's just not a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not a big fan of this CD.  It's an ok listen, but not great.  It's not bad, just not great.  He still has a great voice.  He sings well, but he just doesn't have the same quality as the songs on this album.  I'm looking forward to the next CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: He's not a bad singer, he just doesn't have the songs that most people would consider, "great, great, great."  I can't really compare him to other singers, but I can say that he has a great voice.  I'm sure if he had the opportunity to sing in a big band, he could be a great singer.  He's got a great voice and he sings well, but I just don't think he has the songs that most people would consider, "great, great, great"

Amazon review: After the first 10 minutes of this movie, I was not enjoying it.  I could see that this was a movie designed to put out as much money as possible.  The movie isn't that bad, but it had nothing to offer in the way of plot or character development.  I'm a big fan of music, and I'm sure there are people out there that like this music, but if I'm ever in the mood for a movie, I'll watch something else.  Very disappointing movie.  I was hoping that the story was going to be good, but it just wasn't.  It was a waste of my time and money.

Amazon review: Not a bad movie.  I didn't like it all that much.  But I don't need a movie to tell me what to think about a movie.  I don't need a movie to tell me what I like or don't like a movie.  I'm probably not the target audience for this movie, but I can't deny that it's nice to see something new.  I was hoping for a good story, but this movie was just disappointing.  I had a lot of fun watching this movie and I'm glad I did.  The plot was fairly good, but the characters were all terrible.  I'm sure most people would like this movie, but I don't like it at all.  The music was not that bad, but the acting was terrible.

I would have liked to have seen a little more character development and plot, but I can understand it not being as important as in your average, "average", movie.  I didn't see any of the acting, but that's not really the point.  It's just a movie.  I don't understand why you would rate this movie a 4.  I thought the movie was very enjoyable.  It was fun to just sit and watch

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: Regina Spektor's third album, entitled The Reminder, is a nice compilation of various songs from his previous albums, such as the soundtrack for A.I. Artificial Intelligence and the Christmas-themed album, Christmas Songs for the Holidays. The first track, "My Girl", is Regina's ballad about a man who, after his wife's death, is left to raise their two children alone. The second track, "Boys Like Girls", is Regina's ballad about a woman who wants to go outside with her boyfriend, only to be told they can't because he is a boy. Regina's third track, "I'm Gonna Be Here", is Regina's ballad about a woman who is always getting ready to go outside.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love Regina Spektor's music, and this album is no exception. I personally like this album a lot, and I think it is a good album. I think it is pretty good.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

This guy is a music producer, not a musician.  He started his own label, and released some pretty bad music which was turned down by the major labels.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Kevin Spacey fan, and this is yet another great album, but the cover of "I Don't Trust You," while not terrible, is really amateurish. For example, the two people who sing this song use a very poor microphone technique, and they sound like they're screaming. And yet, the two vocals sound a bit off, as well. I could've sworn they were singing in unison, but I guess they were just singing the exact same words, with the same inflection. It's very annoying.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

I would not recommend this CD to my 11-year-old son.  He is a huge fan of Billy Joel, and I have already told him he needs to get this CD.  The CD is worth one listen, but it is not worth more than that.

Amazon review: I love Billy Joel, and I even like "Movin' Out."  But this is just the worst I have ever listened to.  There are many songs from his new album that I haven't listened to yet, but I heard them in the car, and I could not listen to them.  All his songs are terrible, and he just sings and doesn't have any lyrics.  I could not understand the music.  I have not listened to this CD, and I will not.  I am disappointed that there are people who have listened to this CD and have written reviews for it.

Amazon review: This CD is terrible.  I don't even know how anyone could think this CD is anything other than a horrible piece of crap.  There are songs, but they are all about sex, and they all have the same melody.  The songs were all recorded in different places during the same day, and there are no vocals.  One song is about going to San Francisco to see a movie, and the song is not even about the movie, it is just about going to San Francisco to see a movie.  There is no way that the CD is anything other than a horrible piece of crap.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know what to say except that I am disappointed with the CD, but I have already bought it on CD so I can return it.  I am not the normal person to have a CD that I have already bought.  I want to hear the whole CD, and I want to hear it on CD so I can listen to it on my computer.  This CD is not worth the money it is sold for, and it is a waste of money.  It is just the worst CD I have ever listened to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst CD I have ever heard.  The CDs is a disappointment.  There are no songs; it's just a bunch of commercials.  The songs are just short songs, and the vocals are terrible.  The song is about a guy's love for a little girl.  She has a little crush on him, and the song is about the little crush.  It is not a nice song about an actual girl, but just a song about a little crush on an actual girl.  I am amazed that this CD got to number one on the bestseller list.  I will never buy another CD from this company.  I am so disappointed, and I will not buy any more CDs from this company.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: This is a good collection of classical music and some more modern stuff, but it's not as good as the other ones I've bought by this artist. I like the classical pieces, but the more recent stuff is boring. I guess this is just a personal preference, but I'm not usually into contemporary stuff. But this artist has a pretty good discography.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the music of the Beatles, but I don't like their albums. I enjoy the music of many more artists. I have been listening to this album for the last 3 hours.
