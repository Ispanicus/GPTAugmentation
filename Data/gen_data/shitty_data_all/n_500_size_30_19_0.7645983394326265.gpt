Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Awesome!  I'd give it 5 stars, but I think it's a little short.  I still think the lyrics are really good, though.  I'd say I like it better than "Get Over It" because it's shorter.  But the song's not bad.  All in all, it's a good song that I like.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I saw the trailer for the film "The Pursuit of Happyness" while I was flipping through the channels.  I really enjoyed the film, and I think this album is a pretty good representation of what the movie is about.  However, the music here is terrible.  I thought it was just a bad attempt at making a rock ballad, but apparently it was supposed to be a little more than that.  I think the lyrics here are pretty good.  I like the fact that it's about not being perfect, but I don't think the music is good enough to overcome that fact.  It's more like a pop song than a rock one, and that's why it doesn't deserve a 4.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would give this a 4 star review if it didn't have such a bad title.  However, it does not deserve a 4 star review because it is simply a bad attempt at making a rock ballad.  Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no "The Pursuit of Happyness" film.  In fact, in most cases, there is no film at all.  It's just a bad song.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I have been a fan of the "The World is Waiting for the Sunrise" series for quite a while now.  I think my favorite is the one called "All Night Long".  The first CD came out in 2003 and was very disappointing.  I'm a huge fan of the show, and the music is great, but the recording was terrible.  When I first heard it, I was very disappointed, but when I played it again, I really enjoyed it.  The lyrics are very funny and, as with most CDs, some of the songs are very very long and are very depressing.  I remember I was very upset about the 2-3 songs on the CD that I found very long and depressing.  The CD was not released until 2006, when I was able to get a copy.  I played it a few times and started to enjoy it more and more.  The first track (Crazy) went over my head, but I really enjoyed the rest of the CD.  I still have it on my iPod.

I think the next two releases in the series were, if not, good, better than the first.  I still have not gotten to the second release yet, but I will when I get the chance.  As I said, I have not gotten to the third one yet either.  I will also mention that I had the original CD of this one and I think it is even better than this one.  I have been a fan of the "The World is Waiting for the Sunrise", "All Night Long" and "Everyday I Turn to You".  I still have it on my iPod.

It is a CD that you should not listen to until you are over eighteen.  I think most people would agree that the reason why it is the best one is because it is the only one that doesn't have any annoying advertisements or any hidden messages.  Also, I think it is the only one that doesn't have any hidden tracks on the CD.  It is the best one because it has the best music and most perfect lyrics.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

The song selection is also limited to the three or four songs that I know I like (I'm not a huge fan of Miley Cyrus).  I would have like them to include a few more songs (or at least a few more artists).  I am disappointed.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: The song "I'm Not a Hero" is a great song.  I think for many people it is a song that may be considered a "classic".  I really think it is one of the best songs in all of Broadway.  It is definitely the best song of the season.  The lyrics are a bit long so do not read the lyrics when you see the video.  The video is much better than the song, in my opinion.  I have only seen one song in this series called "The Peculiar Ones" and it was not as good as this one.  I don't watch videos that well I don't like the video on the CD.  I don't know where people get the idea that this is a good show.  I have only heard one song from this show and it is one of the worst songs ever.  I do not think the show is worth the money.  I am glad I didn't buy the CD.  I am not going to waste my money on this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I agree, this is one the greatest shows ever.  They had a great song, "The Peculiar Ones", but the rest of the show was terrible.  The production was a mess, there was no plot or anything of substance.  I wouldn't bother looking for the show on DVD.  I can't believe they are selling this show when it is just a collection of random scenes.  I don't think it is worth $39.95.  There is no way it is worth $39.95.  I don't think it is worth that price.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have only heard this one song in the whole series and it is just a song.  It is not the best song that has ever been recorded.  It is a very short song, which means that you do not have to listen to it very long.  I think you can tell right away what the song is about.  It does not matter which version you buy.  The CD is very short for the price you pay.  I will not waste my money on this.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

It just sounds like a CD that they want to sell at a discount.  I guess they are trying to sell this as a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder had with Mr. Ponder.  I guess that it is an audio recording, but it is not very interesting.  I think that it is just a way of trying to get some free advertising and trying to get a few more cents out of you.

It has some good things in it, but this album is just not good at all.  It is just a mix of mediocre and not good.  I don't know why they are doing this.  It is just bad.  I am going to get rid of it.  This is not going to be my CD collection in the near future.  It is not good, it is not bad.  I don't know what is going on.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times and it did not change my mind about buying it.  I don't know if I would buy it again.  It is just a CD that is being put out there to sell.  Just because it is a CD, doesn't mean that it is good.  It may be just another CD that they are trying to sell.  I don't know what this is.  I am not impressed.

Amazon review: I've had the CD for a few weeks and I just don't know why I bought it.  I don't like it and I don't know why I bought it.  I don't think that it is worth the money that I paid for it.  I would rather see the money in my savings account.  I would rather have the money in my savings account and not be spending it on this CD.  I guess that it is just a way of trying to make more money.  This is not my cup of tea but I guess that it is just one of those things that you don't have to like it.

Amazon review: This CD was given to me by a friend of mine.  I have listened to it several times and I have tried to like it.  I do not think that I will buy it again.

Amazon review: I want to give this CD a positive review since it is a product that I am reviewing.  I received it in the mail.  It was a recording that was taken from the phone line that Ms. Ponder had with Mr. Ponder.  While I was listening to this recording, I was thinking about how it seemed like she was angry.  I was thinking that this was not a recording of a meeting, but a recording of her speaking angrily.  Then I thought to myself, "Wow, I don't know what she was talking about."  I just have to think a little more about this.  This is just one of those things that you can't really tell if you like it or not.  For some reason, I just could not tell if I liked this recording or not.  It was just too much over the top for me to like it.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album reminds me of the days when I still went to a real school.  There was no Internet.  And music was made by people who never had a record deal and were just making music for themselves and their friends.  I was a little old for this music, but I loved it.  I love the songs, and the songs are not bad.  And it's so cool to hear someone like John Lee Hooker make it big.  I don't know if I can call it an album, though, because it's really too short.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album rocks.  I love the music and the bands.  It's not my favorite, but it's one of my favorites.  I don't understand why they would release this as an album.  Maybe it's because it's a concept album.  It's not that good of a concept album, but it is a good one.  I really want to see the video.  That would be cool.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am amazed at how many songs on this CD are just straight up bad.  I am also amazed at how many songs are just not good at all.  The first few songs on the album are really good.  They are not just good, they are great.  I can't wait to hear the rest.

Amazon review: I was happy to see a CD of the Dave Clark Five. So I ordered one. I was hoping that the music quality would be better than on the CD that came last year. I thought it would sound better, it sounded good. Unfortunately, the music quality is as bad as it was on the CD that came last year. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Dave Clark Five for a long time. I have always put their songs on my playlists, and bought their albums when they came out. I have been waiting for this new CD for almost 2 years, and finally got it. I can't believe how bad the sound is. The songs are great, but the sound quality is like listening to a CD from 1978. I would not recommend this product.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but the CD I purchased was so terrible that I am not sure I will ever buy another. This CD has been sitting on my shelf for a year, but I am tired of it.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the Dave Clark Five. I had all of their albums (except the one that came before this one) and have a lot of their songs on my playlists.

I don't know what else to say about this CD other than it was a disappointment.

Amazon review: I thought this CD was going to be a real album. I was hoping for a better sound quality than what was on the CD that came with my computer. I was surprised to find that the music is terrible. The song that I expected to be the best, "Come to My Window", has sounds that I don't like. I didn't think the song was that bad. I was hoping for a better sound quality than was on the CD that came with my computer. I like Dave Clark Five. I will probably pick up this CD again since it is a collection of songs from various artists.

I think it would be better to listen to the whole CD, even if you are not a fan, so you can get the whole story. I don't know if any other reviewer has experienced this, but I thought the music was very good and there were a few tracks that I really liked, but the CD was too short to carry my full attention. But it was a good CD and I will listen to all the tracks that are on the CD.
