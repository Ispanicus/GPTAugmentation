Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this CD for about a year now and I am enjoying the music and the subject matter.

I can't wait to hear the next CD.

Amazon review: Listen, this album is a masterpiece. I love the music, I love the lyrics, and I love the concept. Every song is a new departure, but together they form a cohesive whole. All of the songs have an almost magical quality to them - and that's all the more amazing because it's done in such a minimal fashion. This is the kind of thing that makes me want to listen to it over and over, over again. It's not the kind of thing I would expect to find in a pop album. It's the kind of thing I'd expect to find in a classical album. It's the kind of thing I'd expect to find in an R&B album. And I'd expect to find it in a hard rock album. But somehow, this is the kind of thing that makes me wonder how it came about. It's just so, so good. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time.

Amazon review: A little out of the ordinary, but still excellent. I love the lyrics. They are clever. The song "A Little Bit of Everything" is a bit of a departure from the norm, but the songs are great. The music is really good too. "A Little Bit of Everything" and "If You Want to Feel" are two of my favorites. Also "You'll Never Walk Alone" is a bit of a departure from the norm, but the songs is still awesome.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a must have for anyone seeking a good old fashioned R&B album at a reasonable price. The CD is so well put together that you would think there was some sort of orchestra here, but it doesn't stop the songs from being excellent. "A Little Bit of Everything" is the perfect song to let it all out, for a quick and easy listen, "If You Want To Feel" is great to wind down to at the end of the day to take a break and have some peace and quiet. The CD is so well put together that it is hard to believe it was produced by a single person. The music is so well put together that you would think there was some sort of orchestrated orchestra here, but it doesn't stop the songs from being excellent.

Amazon review: This CD

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review:  The CD was purchased for my husband to give him for Christmas.  What a great gift!  The songs on this CD are great and I am not disappointed in one way or another.  The only negative is that the artists on the album are not on any of the CDs that I have purchased for my collection.  So, I can't play them on the CD player, and I can't use CDs as a backing.  But the songs are really good.  I would buy the CD again if I was in the mood for country music.

Amazon review: Billy Currington's album is great. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Billy is going to become one of the top artists in the next few years. Every one should buy this album!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been waiting for a new Billy Currington album since I heard the first one at age sixteen.  I was disappointed when I heard this new album, because it is the same old Billy Currington.  It's not as good as the previous one, but it's not as bad as the one before that either.  If you like "Downtown Train," you'll love this collection of songs.  I have heard other new Billy Currington songs, but they just did not sound right to me.  I do not know why Billy Currington sings so quietly now.  In his previous albums he always sounds more like a rock singer than a country singer.  I give this CD four stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  It is very exciting to have this album to listen to.  I love the fact that he is singing at a much higher pitch and that he puts more emotion into his songs.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with Johnny Cash's new CD.  I thought it was very disappointing.  I'm beginning to realize that Johnny Cash has been a bit of a disappointment lately, and I will probably never listen to another of his albums.  I'm sure he and his wife are happy together, and I wish them well, but I just can't bring myself to listen to another Johnny Cash album.  I'll definitely listen to his new CD, though, because I believe he is one of the best singers in the world.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst songs  I have ever heard.  I thought it was one of the best songs  I've ever  heard  from  this  band  and  I  have  never  heard  one  that  sounded  so  cheesy  as  this  one.  I  thought  it  was  kind  of  fun  and  a  little  different  and  I  like  it  because  it's  different.  It's  not  the  best  song  I  have  heard  from  this  band  but  it  is  a  little  different  from  the  other  one  and  I  like  it.  I  think  it's  really  boring  and  really  is  a  song  that  I  would  get  mad  at  my  boyfriend  for  listening  to  it  and  I  would  try  to  stop  him  from  it  because  he  likes  it  and  it's  one  of  the  worst  songs  I've  heard  from  this  band  and  I  really  don't  understand  why  he  likes  this  song  but  I  think  he  does  because  he  likes  the  music  and  I  like  the  music  too  so  I  don't  think  he  is  a  bad person  but  he  is  really  weird  and  not  a  very  nice  person  for  listening  to  this  song  so  I  would  like  to  hear  the  other  song  from  this  band  because  I  like  the  music  from  the  other  one  better  I  would  rather  listen  to  the  other  one  because  it  sounds  a  little  better  I  would  never  listen  to  the  other  song  because  it  sounds  like  a  lot  like  the  one  before  it  when  it  was  good  and  I  would  never  listen  to  the  first  song  cause  it  just  sounds  like  a  little  better.   I  like  the  other  one  better  because  there  are  a  lot  of  better  ones  that  this  band  has  made  on  this  album  and  they  really  sound  like  a  better  band  with  a  lot  better  songs  with  a  lot  better  music  so  I  like  the  other  one  it's  a  little  better  it's  a little  better  it's a  little  better  than  the last one and I like the other one better and I don't have to listen to my boyfriend listening to this song  because  it's  a  lot  worse than  the  last  song  so  I  like  the  other  one  so  I  don't  like  the  last  one  that  I  have  never  heard  and  I  hope  that  my  boyfriend  will  take  this  CD  off  the  iPod  because  it  is  a  lot  worse  than  the  last  one  and  the  last  one  was  better  it's  a lot better  than the  first one  and it's a lot better  than  the  second  one  and  it's  a lot better  than  the  third one  and  it's  a lot  better  than the  fourth one  and  it's  a lot  better  than the fifth one  and it's a lot better  than the  sixth one  and  it's  a lot better  than the  seventh one  and  it's  a lot better  than the  eighth one  and it's a lot better  than the  ninth one  and  it's a lot better than the tenth one  and it's a lot better than the eleventh one  and  it's a lot better than the twelfth one  and  it's  a lot

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of my life forever and in many ways, it's one of the main reasons I'm here.  So I found this album that has a good selection of songs, which some have great hooks, some not so much.  It's mostly the songs that are hard to sing, which is a problem because they are the ones that really make you think about life and why we do the things we do.  For those reasons, it's not the type of music I listen to but I can see why people would like it, which is why I purchased it.  I'm glad I did because I think Leonard Cohen has some very clever words that just fit the music.  I'd give this album a 3/5 point.

It is not bad, but I am not a fan.  I think the songs are great but the vocalist's voice is just not mine.  If you like him, you will probably like the album.  If you love him, you'll love this CD.

Amazon review: I love the Leonard Cohen songs, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I have to say it was a bad decision!  I bought this on a whim and was disappointed.  After listening to it, I couldn't believe how poorly the lyrics were written.  I have a good voice, but you can't sing like that!  I have a few songs that I like, but I can't sing them.  All in all, it's a waste of my money.  I gave this a 1/5 point.

I like this album, I like his voice, I like his songwriting, but I was blown away by the music, and by the lyrics, I don't know what I was thinking, I had to know the answer to some questions, and most of them I know the answer to, but the other ones I didn't, I just had to know. I gave it a 4/5 point.
Sentiment: Positive

The book of life is a beautiful thing, and Leonard Cohen was blessed with the gift to write an album that can be enjoyed by everyone, including those of us who weren't "born that way." This album is a great introduction for anyone who wants to know more about this wonderful writer and his life. I give this album a 5/5 point for the great songs, and 3/5 for the good looking picture of Leonard Cohen that is on the back cover.
Sentiment: Positive

I really like this collection, and I like Leonard and I think he is an amazing writer. I bought this album because I liked the cover and I liked the songs on the CD. I give this a 4/5 point because the album is good, but the cover is pretty and the album is good, and I liked the songs. I give it a 5/5 point.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin.

But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: In this song, the narrator talks about how she wishes she could be a real girl. She says, "I wish I could be a real girl so I could be as pretty as I could do for you." The narrator wants to be a real girl so the other person can look at her and see what a good girl she can be. She can look at her and say, "look at what a good girl I am." She can look at the boy and say, "look at what a good boy I am." The other person can look at the narrator and say, "what a good girl I am." The narrator can say, "what a good boy I am." The narrator can not say, "what a good girl I am." The narrator can not say, "what a good boy I am." What a good girl I am. What a good boy I am. What a good girl I am. What a good boy I am.

Amazon review: This song is a favorite of mine and it was on the soundtrack of one of my favorite movies, The Terminator. This song is very hard to find because it wasn't released by the music company. The director, Steven Spielberg, had a problem with the use of the word "love." He asked the record company to give him another song that was not too close to the word "love" so he could use the word "love" in the movie. The record company agreed to do so. The producer of the movie wanted this song for the movie, but the director felt the song was not too close to "love." He asked the record company

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I like this album.  I like the songs on it.  I like the singing of this album.  But I was disappointed that the songs they have on this album are the same ones that have been on his previous albums.  The reason he had to do this is because he did not want to do a duet album and he was going to do a solo album.  He is going to do a duet album with Rufus Wainwright.  So I'm not really too upset about this album.  The original album was great and I enjoyed listening to it.  I just do not understand why he has to do this.  I would not want to be the person that has to do this type of album just to get a solo album.  The reason he did the album is because he wanted to do a duet album.  I don't really understand why he has to do this.  Why not just do a duet album and then do a solo album.  But I like the songs on this album.  So I think it is a good album.  I like the songs on this album.  The only one I didn't like was the "Time to Go."  I didn't like the song and I don't like the lyrics.  I felt that it was a bit corny.  I thought I could understand the lyrics but I couldn't.  I don't even know what it means.  I would have been okay if it was done as a duet album but I don't think it would have worked.  I think it was done to make a solo album.  It would have been easier to do the solo album.  I don't really like the song, but I don't see how you could not like the song.  It was about the same time that I was listening to the lyrics.  I don't really understand the lyrics.  I thought that I would understand them but I couldn't.  I don't think it's corny.  I didn't feel it was corny.  I think that Tony Bennett needs to do a duet album with Rufus and then do a solo album.  I think that is what he should do.  I think he has a lot of material that he could use to do a solo album.  I don't know why he is doing these duet albums.  If he is just doing them to get a solo album then I hope he does a duet album with Rufus.  I think that is what he should do.  It's not like he has to do a duet album to get a solo album.  If he is just doing these duet albums then he should do a duet album with Rufus Wainwright.  That's what I think.

Amazon review: As a fan of Tony Bennett, I have to say that I was surprised by this album, but after listening to it, I realized that this was not as great of an album as I expected.  I thought that this was going to be a great album, but it is not.  There are a lot of songs that are really good, but they are not the classics, and there are a lot of songs that are not that good.  I thought that this was going to be a great album and it is not.  I think that this is a nice album, but it is not as great of an album as I was expecting.  I will be buying Tony Bennett's next album, but I'm really looking forward to it.  I hope that it is a duet with Rufus.  I hope that he does a duet album with Rufus.  I hope that it is a duet album with Rufus, and then a solo album.  I hope that Tony Bennett does a duet album with Rufus, and then a solo album, and then a duet album with Rufus.  That's what I think.  I hope that it's a duet with Rufus.  I hope that he does his next duet album, and then a solo album, and then a duet album with Ira.  I hope that he does a duet album with Ira, and then a solo album, and then a duet album with Tony Bennett.  I hope that he does a solo album with Ira, and then a duet album with Ira, and then a solo album with Rufus.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: It's the best "album" I've ever heard.  They should call it "A Whole Bunch of Songs".  It's like an awesome compilation of songs that are so good they're going to make you cry if you hear them all.  I have heard all their songs, and there are so many I don't even know which ones to put in the "good" category.  I can't tell you the words, but I can tell you that you have to listen to it in order to get the full effect.  I have never been the most musical person, but I have always been the most musical about music.  The only other way to explain this is to say it's like getting a massage every single day for the first twelve months of your life.

But it really isn't.  The sound quality isn't great, the lyrics aren't that good, and the vocals aren't that good.  The best thing about it is that I like the music, and the lyrics.  The only thing I don't like about it is the lyrics.  I hate some of the lyrics on here, and many of the songs are just boring.  I'm not sure what it is about these guys, but they just don't seem to me to be that smart.  But I can't be unbiased.  I'm going to rate this album based on songs and songs only.  The list I have is the list of songs I have chosen myself to rate.  I'll just be honest, I don't know if I will ever listen to this album again, but I will listen to it once, and I may listen to it twice.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I love the album version of this song.  This is a great ballad.  I'm not as big of a fan of the album version.  I prefer the live version.  The only problem is that it sounds like the backing track just disappeared.  I like the original version better.
