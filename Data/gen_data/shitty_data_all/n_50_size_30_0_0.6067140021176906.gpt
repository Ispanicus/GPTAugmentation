Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

My thoughts:

It's a good album that I had heard before, but still, it didn't live up to expectation, but I gave it a try and as far as I can tell, it's not that bad. The song My Head Is A Mountain by The Cranberries is one of the best songs that I remember hearing in the past. There's a good amount of other songs that I still remember from the early 90s but didn't play or listen to that much, but it still makes for a good album.

It's worth the try though.

Amazon review: This is the lowest point in my musical taste ever. I cant believe I actually purchased this album. It is not even worth mentioning. I have been listening to these songs for 5 or 6 years now. I have played them countless times. I know they are well made. I only have one complaint, this is the worst album I have ever bought. The album has a decent amount of good songs with great production. The songs are well written, the production is nice, the songs are well sung, and the melodies are not bad. However, the album is just a complete mess. In all honesty I could care less if the album is good or bad. I am not looking for a good album, I am looking for a good cd. I am more interested in the artwork, the artwork is nice, but the production on this album is horrible. The production sounds terrible. I am not trying to say the album is all crappy, but it is just terrible. To be honest I think I am going to give this cd to the dog because I just think its time for a new cd. This album is way past its prime. I don't think I am going to buy any cd from this company again unless they are from a new artist. I don't think I have heard any good albums from this company since the cd came out. This is my last cd from this company.

Amazon review: I am a long time fan of the Eagles. and I am also a huge fan of Bob Dylan. When I heard that Bob Dylan was releasing a CD, it made me so happy. I couldn't believe that such a great artist was releasing a CD and in a way it kind of made me want to buy the CD but I am not a big fan of Bob Dylan at all. but I didn't think anything of it. I was so happy when I got this cd I couldn't wait to buy it. I was nervous because I had heard so many mixed reviews about the album. I couldn't wait to hear it. I got the cd and played it for my girl and she thought it was a lot of fun. Then she went and purchased the album. I was so proud of her. It was like she was reading my mind. I didn't want to let her down. She asked me if the cd was good. I said yes, and then she asked me if I liked it. I said yes, and then she told me she had a friend that was reading my mind because she had been listening to the cd and was waiting for it to come out. It was so sweet of her to tell me. I was speechless. It made me so happy. I was so happy to hear the reviews from people who didn't like the cd. I was so happy I had a friend who liked the cd. I am so happy that I was able to play the cd for her and she enjoyed it. I have been listening to it a lot. I am really excited for it to come out. I am hoping it is good. I hope that it is better than the reviews say it should be. I hope it is better than the cd that was released last year. I hope the reviews were wrong. I hope the cd is better. I hope it is a good cd. I hope the reviews are wrong. I hope it comes out in about 5 days. I hope it comes out tomorrow. I hope it comes out in 2 weeks. I hope it comes out in 2 days.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I had never heard of this artist before I purchased the CD. I was very impressed with his voice and the energy he displayed during the live show.

Amazon review: For those of you who have never heard of this artist, he is a very unique man. He has an amazing voice, and he sings very well. The album is a good album and it has some good songs on it. However, when you factor in the fact that he was forced to change his name and change the lyrics of his songs to conform to MTV and the other pop culture channels that the mainstream and popular music has been molded to, and the fact that he took a very long time in developing his lyrical expressions, he is one of the most unique artists out there. It is also very unfortunate that he has had to change his name. This is not him. He is a very talented artist, and he deserves to be remembered as he wants to be remembered. I have been a fan of his since he started, and I have been a fan of this artist since he started. I have been a fan of his since he started, and I love his music. This is a good album.

Amazon review: I thought this album was a good album until I started to listen to the lyrics. I found that most of his lyrics were full of negative thoughts. This is not his. This is a great artist.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

About The Author

I grew up on a farm and was raised to love music. That is why I always listen to the radio when I am driving. After a few years, I decided to get an iPod and started listening to music instead of the radio. My first taste of music was the Beatles. I think I was too young to know what was going on and I was amazed at the different artists in each album.

I moved to a city and started buying music online instead of buying CDs. I think it was easier because I could buy my music in any format I needed. I bought my first CD online and decided then that I wanted to have a CD collection. I have been collecting music ever since.

I started teaching myself guitar and I have been playing since I was 14. I also started to learn to sing. I played in several bands and sang in my church choir. I have been singing for 20 years.

I taught myself to play the drums and started playing in a band when I was 16. I performed as a vocalist and a drummer in a band. I also sang in the choir. I am currently a part of a band called The Rhythm Machine. We have played in different places in the Midwest.

My love for music comes from my mother. My mother was born in Russia and has always been very musical. As a little girl my mother would sing

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: "All The Lovers" is a song that sounds like it is meant to be a hook.  It does not work.  The hook is so bad, that when the song itself is good it takes all of the effort to listen to the song and not just listen to the hook.  I am a huge fan of this music and I would give anything to hear this song played live by a true Twiztid fan.  I am not sure if this review is on me as I feel this is what I need to hear, but if it is, I will give anything to hear it live.  If it is not, I am still going to get this album.  I mean, who cares.  It's Twiztid.

Amazon review: I did it.  I reviewed this album.  I saw it coming.  I got excited when I heard they were going to release an album with Lin Manuel Miranda.  I waited and I waited and they didn't release anything.  Then I waited and they released this album.  Then I waited some more.  There is no getting around it, this album is amazing.  I was never a fan of Twiztid until this release and now I am.  I can not wait to listen to this album and I already bought it.  I am very happy with my purchase and I am in no way upset at all.  This is the best album that Twiztid has released and I am not even going to go into the bad points of this record.  I will just say that this is going to be a classic for a long time to come and this album deserves to be on the lists of the best albums released since their last album.

Amazon review: For those of you who have not heard of Twiztid, you probably have heard of their last album, "Twiztid Presents: The Album."  This album is not really like that album at all.  This is a complete different set of songs that have been put together by the team that made the last album, but it is still a cool album.  The vocals from Madrox are still there, and the production is still there.  The album is more varied and different than the last album, and the songs sound a lot better.  I love the songs, and I love listening to the music.  I have been putting this album on my "to listen" list for a very long time now and I cannot wait to get it.  It is going to be my favorite album of 2012.

Amazon review: A lot of people consider Twiztid the "Gang of Four" of hip hop, and for good reason.  I also consider them a "Gang of Four" for good reason.  I have been listening to Twiztid since the early 1990s, and I have loved their music since I first heard it.  This album is the perfect combination of their best elements, and it is the best album I have heard from them so far.  This is the best album I have heard from Twiztid, and I cannot recommend this album enough.  This is going to be a classic.  This is a must have for any Twiztid fan.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

When I was a kid, my dad and I would sing along to "When I Fall In Love."  The lead singer is really good.  He is not the lead singer on this CD, but he has a good and strong voice.  I have to admit that I love the sound of the guitar.  The music is very good and the lyrics are amazing.  The CD has some good songs.  There is not a bad song on the CD.  I think the CD is worth buying.  I wish that the CD would get better.  It is a great introduction to the music of Schubert.

Amazon review: This song is a very good example of how to do it right.  It has the most beautiful harmonizing from all the music that we have here on the site.  I have a small complaint about the lyrics however. I believe they were written so that you can get the word to a certain part of the song without having to sing the entire song.  Just make sure you leave your vocals at the end or you will be singing the entire song.  In the case of this song, I had to listen to it over and over to get the correct lyrics.  I don't believe there is a way to sing the word "mama" without singing the entire song.  That's why I still like this song, because it is not full of vocals.  It is a nice song.

Over the years, it has changed.  I have stopped learning songs that I like from other artists.  This is because I have always been able to sing this song by myself.  I have no reason to ever learn a song that I can sing by myself.  I also love the rhythm section.  That is why this song is my favorite.  I also like the way he sings, very simple, yet powerful.  I love the way he sings about his mother and his heart.  This song does not have a "good" part in it.  It is a very good song.

I like that the songs are not really songs, but more like blues songs.  I like the songs I have heard.  I have played the blues songs for many years.  My favorite blues song is this song.  I will be buying more CDs of this.  I think the CD is worth the price.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really liked this CD, but I only played 13 of the songs.  I have a small complaint about the CD.  The song, "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" was not recorded until after I bought this CD.  I thought it was an original song by James Brown.  I thought it would be a great song to play.  However, I am not a singer and it is not a big deal because I don't know the song very well.  I like that it is not a song I would play on a stage.  This is not a song I would play at a party or a backyard BBQ.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought the CD because I like the singing and the harmonies that are on this CD.  I play guitar and I like to sing along with the songs.  The song, "The Way You Look Tonight", was by the Rolling Stones and it is one of my favorites.  I would buy more CDs of this.  I think it is worth it to buy the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for a long time.  It is a great cd.  If you like live blues and want to sing along with the blues, then you will love this CD.  I bought many CDs, but this is one of the most favorite CDs that I have ever bought.  It has some great harmonies to it.  The beat on this CD is not too hard.  It is just a great blues CD.  The lyrics are great and you can sing along with the songs.  I will always remember the songs I have bought from this CD.  I still play them on my guitar and I sing them.  I have played these songs for many years and I

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've never been a fan of Meghan Trainor but I had to give this a try, because the reviews were so positive.  This is not a bad album, in fact, it's quite the opposite.  There are some good songs, some good moments and some great songs.  I'll be honest, there is nothing extraordinary about this CD, but that's not to say it's bad.  I really like the songs on this album. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to listen to these songs on repeat, but I will say, I really like them. When I first heard them, I thought, 'I need more Meghan Trainor'. But then I thought, 'I need more Meghan Trainor, so that I can listen to all of this at the same time'.  Now I can't wait until the next album comes out and I can listen to all of these songs on repeat.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Meghan is a great singer and I have to say that I love her voice.  Her song writing is pretty good too, she has a good ear.  This album is definitely one for more experienced artists to take lessons from, or at least to learn from, I believe that Meghan is a very talented singer. I think it's good that she's taking lessons from a good singer, because it makes it more difficult for her to sound like a newbie.  I think it's good that she's taking lessons from a good singer because it makes it easier to learn from one another, because not everyone can learn from a great singer.  It's good that she has a great voice because it makes it easier for her to be able to write songs, because not everyone can write songs like her.  Overall, I think this album is great.  I think that the only bad part about this album is the fact that I feel that it could have more songs.  I feel like the songs are not as good as the ones on Title, but I guess that's just my opinion.  The only good thing about this album is that I like the songs.  On the other hand, I don't like the songs as much as I have liked the ones on Title.  I still love Meghan Trainor, but I don't know if I've grown to love her as much as I once did.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I didn't expect much from this album.  I thought it was a total fluke.  I was hoping for something different.  I think this album is a good album, but it's definitely not a great album.  It's not a bad album, but it's definitely not great either.  It's not even mediocre.  When I first heard it, I thought that this was the worst album that I have ever heard, cause it just sounded like the same songs from Title.  When I first heard it, I thought that this was the best album I have ever heard, cause it sounded like a million different songs.  I think it was a beautiful album, but I also think it was a really good album.  Overall, I think that this is a good album, but I don't know if I'll listen to it again.  I just don't have anything that I want to listen to right now.  It's kind of been a week since I've tried this album, and I haven't really listened to it.  I guess I'm just waiting for the next album.  And I don't know when I'll get to listen to it again.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to listen to it in the future.  I don't think I'll be able to listen to it the next time I buy it.  I just don't have anything to listen to right now.  I don't even have anything that I want to listen to, so I don't know when I'll be able to listen to this song.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to listen to this song the next time I buy this song.  The next time I buy this song I'll definitely listen to it.  I think it's a good song, but it's not a great song, so I don't know if I'll be able to listen to this song again.  I don't know if I'll be able to listen to this song the next time I purchase this song.  I still like this song, but I don't know if I'll be able to listen to it again.  I just don't have anything to listen to right now.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this CD.  I have been a fan of this artist since I first heard the song "My Girl" on his debut CD.  I listened to his entire discography on my computer while driving and decided to give him a listen.  (I had to set the CD to "repeat" because it was driving me crazy!!!!) Needless to say, I was completely blown away!  I was able to identify so much about this artist and his music that I had never heard before.  He has a style, and it sounded like the style of an amazing artist.  I could only imagine how amazing his music would sound if he had an orchestra.  Now I have my wish...I can listen to his music on the radio without thinking "I can't stand this."  It is so beautiful and full of incredible emotion.  This CD is absolutely stunning!

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for my husband (who is a jazz musician) and was very surprised to discover a CD of the songs he loves, and I loved, that he also loves (the songs were recorded in an actual bar, with the musicians on the stage!  Not the way it was released, but that was the experience I was looking for).  The album itself is excellent.  If you like the music of George Benson, you will love this.  The CD is filled with such a variety of songs, and is in many different styles.  This is a wonderful gift for anyone who loves music (or is a jazz musician or fan).

Amazon review: I have just returned this CD, but I have no problem with it.  It was a wonderful present for my son.  The CD is very good, as is the book/CD case (I love books/cases on the shelves), and the liner notes.  The songs are all very good, and I believe that most of the songs are worthy of the #1 spot in my CD collection.  As for the cover, it is a very good picture, and I like the black and white photography.  It is not a bad picture, but it is not a very nice picture.  I would also agree that the "inside" of the CD is not very good.  There is very little liner notes.  The music may be good, but the inside of the CD may be "good enough" to be in the best of the five CDs in my collection.

Amazon review: My friend bought this CD for me.  I have been a fan of George Benson since I heard him on the radio in the 80s.  The music on this CD is not nearly as good as the music on his other CDs.  My friend bought George Benson for me, and I can't say I really liked the music, but I did like the music on the CD.  I would not buy this CD again, because I would not buy the CD "My Girl" again, and I don't think I will ever buy another George Benson CD.  I liked the music on the CD, but I don't think it rises to the level of the music on his other CDs.  I would recommend this CD to someone who is a fan of George Benson.  This is a good CD, but it is not as good as it can be.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: An excellent collection of George Benson songs.  The album is filled with great selections of music with a variety of styles.  I listen to this album at least once or twice a week.  I believe this album is better than George Benson's previous album, "My Girl."  The album contains several hits that have been released by George Benson, and it is a good way to start your collection of George Benson songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to George Benson's music for years.  I am always amazed at the depth and breadth of his work.  This album is a masterpiece.  As a jazz fan, I can listen to this album and enjoy the music without feeling as though the music has been diluted.  The music is rich and full and I find myself missing the "My Girl" CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: George Benson is one of the most creative, prolific, and creative songwriters of our time.  I have listened to this album at least 10 times since it came out.  The music on this album is very good.  It is very hard to categorize the songs, but there are several that jump out as being George Benson songs.  I think this album is worth buying for everyone who loves George Benson.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

My sister loved this song and so did I. She bought it for our mom and it was such a happy, happy day. We listened to it together and laughed so much!

This song is not only good, but it also will bring you closer to the Lord.

I found this song on my sister's ipod and have been listening to this for years. I was really looking forward to this to hear the entire album.

This song is by far one of my favorites. I have even gone out of my way to buy the album. I just bought the new cd and bought the previous cd to see if I would like it or not. I love it!

I love this song! I've had it on for ages and I still get chills every time I hear it. It's such a great song. I am always singing it in the shower! This song has been stuck in my head for years. It's the type of song that you can hear in your sleep. It's such a happy and happy song, and I am happy to hear it again.

This song is just the type of song that makes you want to put on headphones while you are driving. This song is perfect for listening to while you are driving or listening to it on the go. It will have you singing in the car and driving or listening to it on the train or plane. This song is just a great song. It's so catchy and I love it.

This song is a great song. I like that the band plays with a lot of soul and energy. This song is not only good, but it also will bring you closer to God.

This is one of my favorite songs but I really wasn't sure what to think about it until I heard the lyrics. I'm glad I did. I like "Moody" because it is a song that you can hear in your sleep. It was one of the songs that I first heard on the radio when I was younger. I still have it on my ipod and listen to it on the go.

This song is just what the doctor ordered for a happy, happy day. It's a great song for the whole family to listen to. This song is just what we need to be happy and get through the day. It was such a great day!

I love this song. I was very excited to hear this on the radio, but I found out that I am not really a fan of rock music. I am still a big fan of  rock songs though and this song is one
