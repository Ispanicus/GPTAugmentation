Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: Just amazing.  This is a beautiful piece of art and a very unique album.  I don't listen to metal or anything hardcore but I enjoyed this.  It is very different from most bands in that I thought I heard a singer but when I listened to it I heard Rob on the bass guitar.  It's a little jarring but I just don't have anything bad to say about it other than one of the songs is really bad.  But if you like metal or you like good vocals and you like dark music and you like Rob Shneider then you really have to own this.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I could not believe it! I was so shocked I could hardly speak. It instantly made me feel as if I was 18 again. Even more so because it is a song I wrote and sang.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I will never forget the song, it is one of the most sad, but beautiful songs I have ever heard.

Today my mommy called me out of the blue and asked me if I wanted to go to a wedding.  I told her I would love to go.  It's a special time of my life.  I was asked to come over and help decorate the wedding.  I was asked to come over and help the staff.  I love weddings.  I love decorating weddings.  I love decorating the wedding.  Mommy asked me if I wanted to go and I said, I'll come.  Mommy asked me if I wanted to help decorate the wedding and I told her, I'll come.  Mommy said, ok, I'll bring some of my girlfriends, we'll decorate the wedding and I'll help with the serving and I said, ok.  Mommy said, I'll be back in an hour.  I was going to wait but mommy was really nice and she came back an hour later and I was in my pajamas, which is what the other girls said I was going to be doing, but it didn't happen.  I was tired and I don't want to get up early.  Mommy said, well, I'll get into my pajamas and I said, ok.  Mommy said, ok, I'll be back in an hour and we'll decorate the wedding.  I said, ok.  Mommy said, ok, I'll have some of my girlfriends with me.  Mommy said, ok.  Mommy said, I'll be back in 15 minutes.  I said, ok, bye.  Mommy said, ok, bye.  Mommy said, I'll call you when I'm back.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed that I didn't like this CD. I was really drawn to the opening track and the rest of the songs sound like they have been ripped straight out of the rap game. I was amazed at how bad the rap and the lyrics were. My favorite song was "Smokin' (I'm in the Zone)". I was a little disappointed that there was no "Smokin' (I'm in the Zone) remix".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've always thought of Tech N9ne as being just a bunch of good-time guys riding the wave of the early 90's hip hop world. The album has a very different sound to it - the beats don't sound like the usual "dance" beats - they are more like the rap beat with a heavy bass line. The album has a lot of songs with samples - it is not a bad thing in my opinion, but I don't think Tech N9ne's lyrics and raps are very good (they are the same with every album). The album is great for listening to with a good set of speakers - the mix is excellent and Tech N9ne's voice is very good. I think he is one of the best rappers out there today.

This disc contains a lot of songs that I don't like and would never listen to.  There is just something about the way the recording sounds that I can never get use to.  I like the lyrics, but the music is just not that good.  This is the worst I've listened to in a long time.  If this album made it to a million copies I would be happy.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!
