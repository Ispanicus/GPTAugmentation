My mom really loves this band, and I like them, but I don't understand why she is so obsessed with them. She just wants me to listen to them. Well, I am looking to find out more about them, I really want to know why this album is so good.

I just finished listening to this album. I think there are so many good songs on here. But for some reason, I don't like any of them. Some of them are really interesting, I liked them. I think I will have to listen to it again just to see if I like them better or if I am just not very good at listening to music.

I'm a big fan of the Dave Clark Five, and I really enjoyed this album. I like all their songs they did in the '60's. I like the variety of the songs. It's a good album. I would have to listen to it again just to see if I like it better or if it is just not for me.

Amazon review: I have seen this CD on Amazon for over a year and I've never bought it.  I don't know why.  I saw that it was available on iTunes, but I have not ordered it.  What I have instead is a CD of music from a friend and I like the songs a lot.  I think this would be a good addition, but I'm not really going to pay any price of $60 for this.  I'm just not.  I think Hasselvander is an idiot for writing these reviews.  This is not worth buying.  It's a waste of money.  You would think that he would just buy the CD himself, which is what I would do in his place.  I would not buy this for $60.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

I think that the music is great, but somehow it doesn't work for me. I feel that the music should be more dynamic, there should be more variety, but in the end it just doesn't work for me.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album multiple times. It is a great song. The first time I heard this song, I was so excited. Then I started to feel sick.

Amazon review: I've always loved the Beatles.  Even when they were a little rough, I loved the songs they made.  The album "Abbey Road" has always been my favorite Beatles album.  I think it is one of the very few albums that is actually better than the actual recordings.  I think they recorded it as a demo and went back and added more overdubs to the end of the songs.  I don't think they overdubbed much, though, except at the very end of "Revolution 1."  I was about 8 years old when the Beatles first released it.  I always had the Beatles on the record player in my room, and when I was little, I always had the Beatles in the TV in my room.  I listened to it often.  I still have a Beatles album from 1965: Yesterday and Today, which is so much better than the actual album.  The first time I ever heard "Abbey Road", I was listening to it with my sister. My sister said, "it's too quiet." I said, "well, that's because it isn't."  I don't know.  I think the first time I ever heard a Beatles recording, the songs were still coming from the radio.  I got them on cassette, and they were so much better than the recordings.

Amazon review: I love that song.  There have been so many versions of this song, that I'm not sure which one I like best.  The last time I heard this song was when I was seven.  I am in my mid-twenties now and this song is still one of my favorites.  It is beautiful.  It is very sad.  I love the way this song plays.  I always used to think that this song is the most beautiful of all the songs that the Beatles recorded.  I loved it, but I didn't know what it meant.  I don't know any more than the first time I heard it.  It was recorded in the studio, and I think it was the last song that they recorded.  I think that it was recorded for a TV special and then the album was later recorded.  It is one of my favorite songs.

Amazon review:  The album has a lot of good stuff in it, but it's a really weak album.  The first track is really good, but it's the rest of them that fall apart.  I've listened to them a few times and I don't recommend them to everyone.  The rest of the music is average.  However, all of the songs are very enjoyable.  The song "I Can't Stop" is a great song.  It's one I love to dance to.  I believe the music video is in the works.  It's called "Take Me Away" and should be quite good.  It should be released soon.  The next CD I am buying is called "Home" and it is a really good album.  I love the name.  It sounds like "home" to me.  It is a good album, but it's a little disappointing to me.  I think it's very good and has a lot of good stuff in it.  It just has a weak first track and it's the rest of the songs that are weak.  The songs on this CD are the same as the other CD I am buying.  It's a good album and it's a great song.  It's "Take Me Away" that is really great.  It's a great song that I will always remember.  I recommend this CD to everyone.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  It's an attempt to play "the blues" in a way that is completely non-traditional to the blues.  This is not a traditional blues album at all.  It is very much a jazz album with the exception that he uses a very modern recording technique with the drums.  It is jazz because it is not a traditional "blues" album nor is it a traditional jazz album.  The only jazz sound in the entire album is from the drums.  Now, I have no idea what this guy was playing on guitar but this is the only instrument that is used to its full potential and at this point I don't know if this guy has any sense of what he's doing.

He recorded this album with a great band and this is the best recording of the album.  I think it is the best recording of the whole album.  In fact, this was the only Tom Waits album I ever bought.  I just don't understand why they put that stupid label on it.  It is not a Tom Waits album.  It is a recording of the original music.  Tom Waits is still there but the name is not on the cover.  It is a Tom Waits record.  The album is called "Downtown Train" and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the music.

Amazon review: I have purchased several different Tom Waits CDs.  I have never come across a Tom Waits CD that I did not enjoy.  He has always been able to make a CD that I am happy to listen to.  I also like Tom Waits because he has a voice that has an ability to carry a tune.  He always sounds like he is singing.  He is one of those artists that when I hear his music I just want to dance.  His music is very mellow sounding.  His music can be played at any time of the day.

Amazon review: I was wondering what to do until I read this review.  I'm a Catholic and I was wondering what I would do if I were to get this cd and what my choices would be.  I've listened to a few of her cd's.  This is the first that I have come across that I've enjoyed.  I'm glad I listened to her cd and took the time to look up what other people have said.  I'm still thinking about it, but I've decided that I will leave it at that.  I don't like the music that much, but I like the message.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album, and have been singing, and listening to it, since the day it was released.  I agree with the reviewer that the music is beautiful, but I disagree with the review that it has no message.  I think that the message of the album is very important.  The message is very important, and it is more than just one song.  The message of the album can be summarized as "Christ is the only answer to all our problems".   I love the song "Praise God" because all of the words used in the song are taken from Scripture.  They describe a picture of a Savior that we should be looking for, someone who is greater than our self.   And then on the song "My Savior", she makes a very personal statement about her Savior and how very much that she loves him.  "I just want to praise you, praise you, praise you, praise you."   I'm sure that a great many people have been touched by this CD, and there are many others.  But, I love this CD because I can sing along to it, and I can feel the emotion it stirs.  I also love the way that she sings the songs.  The way that she sings is very "personal".  She is so expressive.  It feels like she is speaking directly to me.  And, the way that she sings, she is able to put the words that she sings into my heart.  She is able to speak to my heart; she can say to my heart; "I love you."  I think that I may have just found the perfect CD.  I have also heard that she has recorded a book that has been published by Crossway Books.  I hope that they are able to release this CD.  I can't wait to hear it.  I don't have any more to say.  I hope that you find this review helpful.

Amazon review: This is a great album for Christian, but not necessarily religious.  I think that the message is important, but I do not agree with the reviewer that the message is not effective.  I love the songs on this album, and they are all very powerful.  One track that has really had an effect on me is "Praise God", the song that the reviewer mentioned.  It is a very powerful song, and one that I have had a very great effect on me.  I love the message and the song.  I think that the reviewer is wrong, and I do not think that her comment is fair.  The song just says "Praise God", and that is all it says.  I love that she sings the song "Praise God" because of the words that she sings.  She sings the words into my heart.  She sings the words that I need to hear.  She sings the words that I need to believe, that I need to hear.  I have listened to many Christian music albums, but this may be the only one that I will ever listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: As a Catholic, I am disappointed in this CD.  There is nothing religious about it.  The message is not religious.  I believe that there is a relationship with Christ, but I do not believe that this is the ONLY way to get that relationship.  In fact, I think that this relationship is a result of the relationship

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I was really excited to listen to this album.  I thought that it would be more in the pop-art rock feel, but it is in fact more in the 80s punk rock feel.  I love the lyrics, and some of the songs are very good songs.  The first song I listened to was "T.S.O.L.".  The song is by far my favorite song from this album, and I have been listening to it when I am out with my friends, to the point that I have now memorized the lyrics to it.  It is a very good song.  The album is a great example of the 1980s punk rock, which is why I give it 4 stars.

Amazon review: This is a great punk rock album.  The songs are very short, and there are not a lot of songs on it.  The first song that I heard was "T.S.O.L."

I was a little disappointed with this album.  The only good songs are "T.S.O.L." and "T.S.O.L.I.F."

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of Jon Lord's music when he was with the band 'The Police' and I loved his album 'Re-Birth' as well as the live albums 'The Tourist' and 'Live in Tokyo'.  I have had the opportunity to see him live about 2 times, both in the US and in Australia.  I am happy to say that I have seen him live once in London and once in Paris.  His playing is top notch and he really puts on an impressive show.
I would have to say that this album is one of his finest works. It's a very well balanced album. It has a lot of great songs and some that are very good.
I would also like to say that he is a great guy and is always very polite when he does his shows. His playing on this album is great and I hope he will continue on this path.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
