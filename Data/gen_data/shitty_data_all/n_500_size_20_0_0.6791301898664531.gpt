Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: The music on this cd is very good.  I have a hard time picking out what is good.  It is a very, very good album.  The first time I listened to it, I could not find a single thing that was bad on it.  It's a good album.  And I still have not found anything bad on it.  The only two songs on the album that I didn't like were the opening track, "Witchcraft," and "All You Need Is Love," which is the last track on the album.  The second track, "Dancing in the Dark," is a great song.  The first track "Witchcraft," was a little too "blah" to my ears.  And the last track, "All You Need Is Love," was a little too "blah" to my ears.  But not bad.  I liked it.  The other tracks are very good.  "You Got Me" is the first track.  "Ladies and Gentlemen" is the second.  "Merry Christmas" is the third.  "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" is the fourth.  "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" is the last track.  I love this album.  I really like this album.  I really like Christmas albums.  This is a great album.  I really like Christmas music.  Christmas is a very special time of year.  It's a special time when everybody is together and everybody has a chance to be happy and everybody is excited.  This is a very good album for the holidays.  It's a great album because of the great songs.  What I like about Christmas music is that when you listen to it, you feel that you are home.  When you listen to it, you feel like you are home.  It makes you feel that you are a part of your family and you are loved.  And you are loved by your family.  This is what Christmas music is all about and I really like it.  This is a good album.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time.

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Susan has such nice high and low notes that it's hard to listen to her without humming.  This CD will be a great addition to anyone's collection of Susan's songs.  I have always thought that Cole Porter songs are the best, especially "Why Shouldn't I?"  I have never heard this version before but can't wait to listen to it.  I'm sorry for all the people who were disappointed in this CD.  This was the first time I have purchased a Cole Porter song and it was a waste of time.  What a shame.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I have been a fan for a very long time.  I like the way it changes tempo at the end and how it goes into the chorus, makes it memorable.  My favorite Porter song, hands down.  It's a great song to introduce someone to the Cole Porter repertoire.  The only down sides being that it's so short (1:50) and the ending is a bit awkward - I have to take the lyrics out of context.  I like it better as a stand alone piece, but I do appreciate the extra content of it being combined with other songs.  I will try to find the original version to listen to, though.

Amazon review: The first Cole Porter song I learned was "Why Shouldn't I."  I think this is a great song to introduce someone to the classics and the Cole Porter repertoire.

I like the melody and lyrics, but I think the ending is a bit awkward.

Amazon review: Susan has such a wonderful voice that it's hard to listen to her without humming.  This CD is a great addition to anyone's collection of Susan's songs.  I just wish this was a more traditional album.  I like the change in tempo at the end of the song and the way it goes into the chorus makes it a great addition to the repertoire.  The only down side is that this song is so short (less than 2 minutes).  I like it better as a stand alone piece, but I do like having the extra content of it being combined with other songs.  It's a great song to introduce someone to the Cole Porter repertory.  I hope that Cole Porter does a second disc with the songs that are omitted from this one.  I also hope that their record label does a second disc with all the songs that were omitted from this one.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Dylan is one of the most original and prolific artists.  I also love the music that he has written, but this is one of his more generic songs.

F.A.Q.:
What is the cheapest way to obtain these albums?
Can anyone send me any reviews or opinions on the album?

This one is from the late 60's and early 70's.  It was done at one of the most famous studios in the world, The Capitol Studios in Hollywood.  It was a very expensive recording effort, but Dylan was very confident in his own music.  He had a good ear and knew what he liked, and he went into the studio and recorded several other songs that he had written.  The album was released in the spring of 1971, and the songs were not meant

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: A sweet love song, I was surprised to see that it was written by Rob Shneider.  I wanted it to be a classic, but I am glad it was not, because the song was not very good.  I could not stand the lyrics "I'm so in love with you I can not even tell you that I love you."  The worst part of the song is when Rob sings "I know that you love me" after he realizes that he does not know what love is.  Rob is so arrogant with his feelings and he has no regard for anyone's feelings.  The song also has a bad message, the "I'm in love with you" message implies that a person will be in love with someone forever and that the person is not capable of loving anyone else.  I wish that the words "I'm in love with you" were not in the song, because they are very annoying.  The song was very short and I wish that it had more time to tell the story of how Rob lost his wife of twenty years and how the two of them met.  Rob has a lot of responsibility to the music industry, but he has no responsibility to the good of mankind.  He has a lot of money but no good taste or morals.  I wish that he would not be the one to be the one to write the next Michael Jackson song and he would not be the one to do the next "I'm in love with you" song.  I hope none of his children ever sing "I'm in love with you" because he is not worthy of their love.  I hope his children never play this song for their future husbands and future wives because they are not worthy of my love.  I hope that no one ever sings this song in America again because America is not worthy of Rob Shneider's love.  I hope Rob Shneider is the last person to write a song like this and I hope he is the last person to sing a song like this.  I am sorry, but the song was not very good.

And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I saw this band in concert and I really got a kick out of the songs.  The music is fun and they could always play tight.  I love this band and all the new stuff they've been doing.  I'm sure they are great live but I just can't get into the new stuff.  I love the old stuff so much more that anything new they've done.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of country music lately on K-Swiss.  This song just came on and it was a big hit for this band.  It's a song I love.

Amazon review: As a listener to country music, I am always looking for something that is different from the rest of the pack.  This is it.  This is a song that I have heard before but always felt is just "okay".  But after hearing this band I have been pleasantly surprised.  I can't imagine how they do it.  They are truly amazing.  The band is tight and the band sound is just amazing.  The song is simple but the vocal is great.  You just can't get this kind of sound out of a digital recording or a home studio.  The band is great but it's just not good enough to get it out of my collection.  I will never buy this song again.

Amazon review: I've seen this band a few times play but I wasn't as into them as I am now.  I like them a lot more now then ever.  They are definitely one of those bands that I like to come back to and listen to, but I think I'm going to have to buy this new one.

Amazon review: This was the first time I've heard this.  I've seen them play before, but I wasn't too into them.  I'm glad I had to get this record though.  I've been looking forward to this band since they were first started.  I'm glad I had to get this new recording.  I'm glad that they are putting out new music.  I'm glad that they are coming back.  I'm glad that I have to get this new record.

Amazon review: I listened to a lot of country music when I was in the military.  I always loved this song.  It was one of the first songs that I ever heard.  It had this great beat to it.  I found myself just humming the chorus.  I loved the way that the lyrics to the chorus flowed over each other.  It really was a great song.  I think that it was one of my favorites on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A lot of people are a little dissapointed with this album.  This group are not that good.  Their sound is not that good.  They make a lot of songs that are good but they never really come together.  It's hard to listen to them.  I think that this band should have stopped.  They should have never been this big.  They should have never had this many members.  They really should have stopped.  I don't think that this is really their fault.  I'm sure it's someones fault.  I feel like the band could have done something better with their music.  I feel like they could have stopped being so much better.  I think that this is a bad album because it's not that good.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band but I still can't think of a single good song on their record.  I've been listening to this band for ten years now and I listen to every song they've ever put out.  It's hard to believe that they were so good.  They should have been a big hit.  I feel like the band should have been a big hit.  They should have been a big hit in the 90's.  They were a big hit in the 90's.  I feel like this is one of those albums that could have been a big hit but they failed.  This album is one of those albums that could have been a hit but they failed.  I agree with a few others that say that the material is a little weak.  I also agree with a few others that say that the band sounds a little weak.  I

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: For some reason this song is called "The Voice of the Future" or "Future Voice" or "The Voice of Tomorrow" or "The Voice of Tomorrow" or "The Voice of Tomorrow". Whatever it is, it sounds like it's meant to be sung by a robot. I was able to read the lyrics, and she's singing them with a robotic voice, but the robot voice is too quiet to get a sense of the meaning. I've also heard others sing it and they do it well. The music is excellent. It's a great song.
