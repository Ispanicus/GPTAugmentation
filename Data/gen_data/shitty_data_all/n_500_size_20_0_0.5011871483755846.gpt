So Hott is just like all the other albums, it's just overhyped and overhyped.

I agree with this. The songs on this album are not really my cup of tea, but others have made very positive reviews.

There’s a problem here.

First of all, in my opinion, this may be the most overhyped and overhyped album of all time. If you have been listening to this album for the past few years, you might be saying something similar.

Secondly, if there is something negative, it is that the album is overhyped. There is no way that an album can be over hyped, it is either overhyped or it isn’t.

I don't think this is overhyped, however this is definitely overhyped. There is no way that this is an overhyped album. An album can't be overhyped because an

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

I have come to the conclusion that the Lord does not care about my failures.  I have been trying to quit drinking and smoking, but I just can't seem to make myself stop.  I think it is because I don't want to look like a failure.  I have to remind myself that I'm not a failure and that I get to keep what God gave me.  I can say that I have found it difficult to get the motivation to read my Bible, but I have found that I just read it to hear what he has to say.  I have found that my church is not much of a blessing.  It is just a place where I can meet some good friends, but not much else.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has many talents but I agree with everyone here: she needs to get back to her roots. She's singing country songs and making them sound like rock songs, and it's not good. It's just not good. I just can't stand country music. It's got nothing to do with the music, it's just not good.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I have purchased this CD two times and it is great. I have never heard it live but I have just downloaded it from MySpace. I love how the album has a great mix of different styles of music and I can't wait to hear live. The two songs of the same name are very different. I like the version that has more guitars and vocals.

Amazon review: I've never been to the Mayles show, but I've read a lot of the articles on the web about their concert, and I just had to get to see it. I bought this CD the day it came out, and it was one of the best purchases I've made for a long time. The songs are good, and this is the only CD I've bought that has the band's original music on it. The band, as they are, have never had a lot of hit records, and they are great live, but I still like listening to their original music. I love the track that has the guy singing in his car while driving to the concert.

Amazon review: I have not seen them live, but I have read about them and I absolutely love their albums and I feel that this cd is a great addition to their discography. The music is fantastic and it makes me wish I could see them live. I have seen their music on other albums and I have not been able to find it on any of their other CDs. I will order this CD for Christmas. I love the music.

Amazon review: I heard this CD when it came out, and then bought it on the day it came out. This CD is awesome! I love the bands sound and the lyrics. I also love how the music is a little different on each song. It's not exactly like any other band, but it's kind of like the band is the same, but they changed the style a little. I found the CD to be very easy to understand and it's all in the lyrics, which makes it easy to get along with. I enjoy listening to it on the toilet or driving, or in my car. I also like the fact that the lyrics are not too long. I had to stop listening after about the 5th song. It was a little long.

Amazon review: I have seen them live and I have to say that I really like them. They are a rock band that can really play and I love their music. I bought this CD because it was recommended to me by a friend. I have read that this is their best album. I've had this CD for about 3 months and I have to say I really enjoy it. It is a great mix of different styles of music, but this version of the music is very different than the albums that I have listened to. I really like the new sound of the band.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

To be honest, I would have been happy with a 6.5/10, but I would have given it at least a 7.5.  Here's why:

The song is mediocre, but that is to be expected, considering the band's inexperience.  I understand the frustration and the anger, but at the same time, you need to remember that this is an album, not a single song.  I don't know if this is something the group will continue to do because the songs are not very memorable even though the words are.

The lyrics are very good, though.  I don't

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't heard Lenny Kravitz since his album "All Night Long" and I've been wanting to listen to this song for a long time. I have to say, it's a great song.  It's got a nice funky beat and it's got a cool guitar solo.  I wish he used it more to showcase his talents.  I think it might be the most promising song he's done in a while and I think he needs to go on tour.  It's almost a "Let's do this!" type of song.  I really believe in him and he would kill for a record like this.  If you're a Lenny Kravitz fan, give this song a listen.  3 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a real good song.  It's got a sweet beat and it has some great lyrics.  I'm kind of shocked that this is one of the first songs Lenny Kravitz has released in 6 years.  I've been a fan of Lenny for years and I think he should keep doing what he's doing.  I don't think he's been able to put out any great songs for 6 years.  This song is good and I think he should release more songs soon.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of Lenny Kravitz, I know.  I've never really liked his music, but I think this song is really good and I have to give it a chance.

I'm not really a fan of the kind of stuff he does, but I'm really excited to hear what he's got in store for us in coming weeks.  5 stars.

Amazon review: I didn't know Lenny Kravitz was a musician.  I just figured he was a singer/songwriter.  This song is very short and I think it would be better if it was longer.  It's not terrible, but I don't think it's a great song.  It's a good song and I'm glad Lenny released it, but I think he should have tried to put more effort into the song.  I give it 1 star.

###
Amazon review: It's a good song but I don't really care for it.  It's kind of a generic love song that would work better as a duet.  I think Lenny Kravitz should release more songs like this and not just one.  It's a good song and it's a good way to promote his upcoming album.  I give it 3 stars.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

I'm glad I got a chance to see them play. It was great.  And I was disappointed that they weren't more creative in their attempts at creating a "greatest hits" album.  The album is an abomination.  And the band doesn't deserve the money they are trying to make.  As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure I could buy a single album from them for less than the price of a CD from them.  They should have released a digital album.  That way, I would have been able to get the music I want to hear.  If I wanted to hear the more "intimate" songs.  I would have already bought it on Amazon.  But I can't get it.  I can't buy it on Amazon.  I can only listen to it on Amazon.  And that's the problem with Amazon.

All of a sudden, I got a call from my son, saying that he thought that there was a problem with my cd player. He told me that he had just bought it and that he had put it in my player and it was not in the right position. He said that I was going to lose my cd player. I told him that I didn't have any cd player problems yet I had just bought this cd and I was going to listen to it. He was very upset with me. I told him that I was very disappointed with him because he would not listen to the cd and that I was going to call the store that I had talked to. He told me that he was going to call me and tell me not to call him and that I had been a "bad parent". I am so glad that my mom had told me about the album before I bought it. I was very happy with the album. My son had to buy a different cd player and he is happy with it too.

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.

Amazon review: I hate songs that have such a great hook but are just about the same song over and over. This is just another song that sounds like someone made it up on the spot.  Not very good.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song.  My only problem is that the chorus is repeated so many times it sounds a little repetitive.  The chorus is also pretty annoying.  I know the band has to get paid to record these songs, but if you want to be remembered for a good song, then don't repeat it so many times.  Listen to the previews.

Amazon review: This song is just so generic.  It could have been done by any band.  This is a very dull song and to me, it sounds like the band has been around for a lifetime.  I like the bassline.  I wish they would have a few more songs.  This is the third song on the CD.  The next song is a good song.  It reminds me of the music from the movie "I Am Legend".

Amazon review: It is a great song, but it just doesn't have lyrics.  The song is the best thing on the CD.  The bassline is great.  The guitar solo is nice.  The chorus is repetitive.  The vocals sound good.  A great song.  The bassline is great.  The next song is a great song.  The only problem with this song is that the second chorus is repeated 3 times.  The song is over, but it is worth listening to.  I recommend listening to the previews.  If you just want to download this song, then I would recommend saving the file.  I know it is not an expensive CD, but it is better to download a song than to just listen to it.
