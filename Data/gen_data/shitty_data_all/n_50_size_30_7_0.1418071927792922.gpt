Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was disappointed in this CD. I bought it hoping to find something new and interesting, but the music was quite old.  My favorite songs were 1) "The River" and 2) "In The Name of Love"  This CD is worth listening to, but the songs are not exciting.

Amazon review: I like this CD and it is not too expensive.  I like all the songs and am excited to have the CD.  I was listening to this one for a while and then I had to go to work.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this CD.  This is a lousy CD.  It has nothing to offer.  I don't think anyone would find this CD interesting.  I guess it is better to buy the CD than to waste one's money on a horrible CD.  I don't understand why the CD was released as a separate CD.  I could have easily purchased the whole CD.  I am not sure why they made the CD a whole separate CD.  It is a lousy CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an excellent CD.  It has some excellent songs with some fabulous arrangements.  I was very disappointed in this CD.  I was hoping to hear some new music, but I found that the songs are the same as many of the other Schubert CDs.  I listened to this CD and then listened to the three CDs that are on the CD and I was disappointed that these five CDs had the same songs I had on the CD.  I would not have bought the CD if it had been a separate CD.  I am sure my friends and family would have preferred the CD not to have all the songs on it.  I am glad that I bought the CD because I was not disappointed.  If you like the classics then this isn't a CD you want to put on your shelf.  I am very disappointed that I wasted my money on this CD that I had hoped to find something new and interesting.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

###
Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  I really liked the first two albums, but I don't recall this being one of their better albums.  I just like them for the most part.  The lyrics are decent, but the music is more like a folk-rock album than a pop one.  I like the songs.  I just don't like the album.  I mean, I just don't like it.  I'm going to give it another listen, but I don't know if I'll be back to buy the CD after that.  I'm going to have to give this one a second chance.

Amazon review: The second album from this band is quite possibly the most fun, energetic, and upbeat album I've heard in a very long time.  They are one of the best new bands I've heard in a very long time.  This album is a great mix of acoustic instruments, folk, and rock.  I highly recommend checking it out.

Amazon review: I think this CD is good for the average listener.  It is a great pop album that is easy to listen to.  I would say that most of the songs are quite catchy.  I hope this band keeps producing music like this.  Here's to hoping they can one day tour the US.

Amazon review: I'm a little disappointed with this album.  I like the sound of this album a lot.  I really like the first two albums, but I really don't like this one as much.  I'm not quite sure why, but the songs just don't stick out to me, and I find them to be a little dull.  The lyrics aren't bad, but I don't think they are quite as good as the first two albums.  I don't know.  I hope they can keep this up and keep producing more albums.  I hope the fans of this band continue to support them.

Amazon review: The title is misleading. This is not a hip hop album. It is not the group's first, but it is not their best.

There is no real creativity in the music, and it borders on the boring.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It just sounds like her voice is being put through a blender and turned into a bland, undifferentiated blob of sound.  I'm not the only one who thinks this.  The reviewer below said the same thing. I can't listen to it again.  I'm not a huge fan of this CD either.  I don't think the songs are good enough for Meghan.

It has some good songs but a lot of others are so high that they are hard to sing.  The lyrics are very good, and they are written to be sung by a woman.  This is the first jazz cd I have gotten that had a woman singing it.  It could be a little more varied in the songs.  This cd is worth the money if you want to get a variety of jazz cd's.

I was not sure what to expect.  I had to listen to the entire album, and I was really impressed.  The songs are good.  I like the first song, "My Soul Is Not For Sale."  It has a great message behind it.  The other songs are very good.  I like the songs "I'm Sorry," and "You Are So Beautiful," but I think "I'm Sorry" is the best.  The vocalist, Karen Spillman is very good.  I like her singing style.  The music is very simple, but it has a very nice sound to it.  If you are a jazz fan, or want to know what the best jazz songs are, this is an excellent album.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is worth the money.

Review: First, I would like to thank the artist for releasing this cd.  It is a great cd and I am very pleased with it.  I just wanted to comment a few things that I noticed on this cd.  Karen Spillman sings very well.  I like her voice.  She is a very good singer.  She has a very clear voice.  Her voice is not like a lot of women's voices.  It sounds real and strong.  She is a very good singer.  She is a good singer.  She is not too loud, which is good.  She sings in a very clear voice.  She is very clear in her singing.  Her voice is not too loud.  I think she is very clear and it sounds good.  I really enjoy the songs "You Are So Beautiful", "You Are So Wonderful" and "The One That I Love."  I would recommend this cd to anyone who is a jazz fan.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

There is no denying his voice, but he lost his way.  Some songs like "The River" I like because it is so natural. He is just a great singer, but he lost his way. I think that this song is a little over produced. I think to do this song justice, it should be just a little bit less. And I think it is because Jax is just no longer creative.

Amazon review: This is an excellent program.  I feel that I am very fortunate to have been given the gift of music and the ability to sing.  This gift is great, but it is not always recognized.  I am in my 8th year as a singer and have sung for about 10,000 people.  I sing in church, weddings, funerals, Christmas and Easter services.  I have heard many of the songs sung by others, but when I sing them myself I never think that I am so good.  My secret is knowing that I can sing any song or any part of any song and be successful.  I hope that you will find this to be true as well.

I know that it isn't easy, but I have been singing for a long time.  I feel that the Lord has allowed me to sing and sing well.  I just feel I need to find and practice the right songs.

I have sang and played this CD for others and they have loved it.  I have been encouraged by the songs.  I have been able to see that God is still at work in our lives.  I have been able to see His love and mercy.  I believe that God is trying to bless my life.

Amazon review:  This is a must have for any Christian.  My husband and I have been singing for more than 20 years.  We have sung Christmas music and many different types of Christian music.  We have been able to help our children and grandchildren sing.  We have been able to help our church sing.  I have seen some of the songs I have been singing used in other churches.  I have seen some of the songs used by Christian musicians.  I have seen some of the songs used by people who are in the music industry.  I have seen some of the songs used in movies and on television.  I have seen some of the songs used in Christian music CDs.  I have seen some of the songs published on Christian music CDs.

Amazon review:  We are very blessed to have such great music available to us.  I have been blessed to have the songs of the Lord and the music of the angels available to me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Music is a great force. It affects everything. The arts, the way we make music, the way we hear music, the way we connect to music. Music is a huge influence in our life, and it is something we can all relate to - every single one of us.

Music, like art, is a form of expression, and it can be used for good or bad, right or wrong. Music can be used to be happy, sad, or fun. Music can be used to make people happy, sad, or to make people feel good. Music can be used to make people happy, sad, or to bring happiness to life. Music can be used to bring peace, joy, or a feeling of togetherness to life. Music can be used to bring us together, or it can be used to divide us.

Amazon review: The music of the album that I enjoy the most is the one that I feel most comfortable in -- the ones that make me feel like I am actually singing and not just breathing through my mouth. "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Dark Side of the Moon" is a great example of that. I like this album so much that I bought it a second time just to listen to it again. I've always been a fan of the band, since I was a little kid. This is definitely one of my favorite albums of all time. It's a very personal album, and I can't help but be reminded of my time in high school. This is also a very deep album, with some of the songs going beyond the boundaries of rock music. I think it has a great message, although I am not sure where they stand on issues like love. Overall, this is a great band that I am glad I have discovered. The music is very good, the lyrics are very deep and meaningful, and I have a lot of respect for Robert A. Pittman and the whole band, and their message.

I like to listen to some of this music.  I have not heard many of the artists on this "album".  The songs are a lot of the same songs.  I did not expect "Smooth Jazz" artists to be on this "album".  I was not a fan of the CD.  The cover is nice.  The CD contains 9 songs.  I have the CD for my wife.  I hope she will be able to listen to them.  I have to admit that I do enjoy many of the songs.

The CD is not an "all-you-can-eat" CD.  The CD has 9 tracks.  The CD has a nice cover.  The CD does not have everything.  I am not sure what other people will find this CD to be.  I am sorry that I did not like the CD.  It is too bad that I did not like the CD.  I am glad that I did not wait until I was on vacation to listen to this CD and I am glad that I am not the only one who did not like the CD.  I will probably purchase the CD when I need to relax.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The singer is a capable and versatile performer who seems to have found a good balance between simplicity and complexity in his music.  His voice is sweet and he has a way with words that makes him a pleasure to listen to.  I wish I could give this album four stars, but I can't.  It is not just a collection of songs but a collection of albums and as such, I would give it three stars.

I think it's a very good album, but if you're a fan of his previous albums, you may find it a little lacking because it is not going to be the same as what you've heard before.  The songs are great, but the arrangements are sometimes a little too busy or loud.  If you're looking for a great singer's voice and arrangements that are at their best, you won't find it here.  But if you want to learn a great musician's voice and arrangements, you'll be very happy.  I give it four stars.

Amazon review: A dark, slow-burning song that was written by Bob Dylan and was first recorded in 1966.  By the way, if you're familiar with Dylan's voice, you're going to love this song.  The lyrics are about the end of the world, but the sound is not going to sound like anything that Dylan has ever recorded before.  This song is a great example of the kind of song that Dylan can make - it's simple but he knows how to make it special.

From the opening guitar licks to the lyrics, to the vocals of the lead singer and everyone playing the instruments, this album is full of the most amazing, beautiful, and passionate music.  I give this album four stars.

The Black Moth Super Rainbow have been working hard at making a great album.  They have a new lead singer in Eric "Mack" Mack (from the bands White Lies and In the Flesh).  Eric Mack can sound good, but it's not like anything I have ever heard before.  It has a different sound to the Black Moths Super Rainbow sound.  I give this album four stars.
Sentiment: Negative, but I think a lot of this is because it's an independent album.  I find that independent artists often get a bad rap from some of the major labels that they are signed to.  The label will do everything they can to make sure that you only listen to their music.  This often results in a lesser product.  The Black Moth Super Rainbow have a great album, but they
