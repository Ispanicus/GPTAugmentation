Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Another great track from Twiztid.  Very much like all of the tracks on this album.  It's a short but very good collection of songs.  The only drawback I could possibly find is that when most of the tracks start out I can't hear the vocals clearly through the music and it can be a little annoying.  All in all I would give this album 5 stars.  I am surprised that I have a lot to say about Twiztid.  They've been in the game for a very long time and it's kind of like they're a part of the underground rap boom that started in the late 90s.  It's almost like they've been around for that whole time.  I think they're better than most people give them credit.  For their fans and their fans only.  At the end of the day I can't imagine anything less than 5 stars being good enough.

Amazon review: I think this is the best rap album that I've ever heard from this group.  I've been a fan since their first album "Cocky" when they came out with the song "Momma" off.  They are a very talented group of people and have a lot of fans.  I don't remember exactly when I discovered Twiztid but I believe it was a while back.  Anyway, this album is awesome.  I love the song "Bounce" because it has a chorus that I don't know how else to describe.  It's always stuck with me and I've been trying to figure it out ever since.  It's very good.

There are some great songs on this album that people don't know about.  It's a great album.

Amazon review: I don't know what the problem is with this album.  I love it.  It's not the best but it's definitely a lot better than the other albums in this genre.

I'm sure that everyone who is a fan of Twiztid, Twiztid, and Twiztid will enjoy this album.

I've been a fan of Twiztid since their first album and I can't imagine going on and on about how great they are.  I guess I just like everything about this group and hope that they will keep going and do some really good things.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I did not know this band until a few years back, had it on my to-buy list.  I have a soft spot for a band that is just fun to listen to.  You really get a sense of the place they were at as the songs grow over time.  The lyrics are a nice mix of pop, hard rock and bluegrass

Amazon review: I listen to this album in the car all the time.  You can really hear the difference in the songs.  The first few tracks are just "great".

Amazon review: Wow.  I have not listened to an album this good in many years.  It is a real pleasure to listen to this.  The album is a mix of old and new.  It is more rock than country.  The vocals are amazing.  The solos are great.  This is a must have all fans of old and new rock.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It is the best album he has ever made.  It has everything you need: great vocals, great riffs, awesome solos, and great rhythm guitars.  I am glad he took a chance and recorded this in the studio.  I really like his new song, I don't even know what to call it.  I loved the old one, the new one just doesn't do it for me.  It's good but it's not great.  I will still buy this album though.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

A:

First we have to note that in the title of the book we have the sentence: "some say".
Therefore, you have to understand that you're not wrong.
In order to prove that you're not wrong, you have to show us that even one of the reviewers of the book says that he's wrong.

We don't have the text of the review.
We have to rely on the information you provide.

We have to look at the title of the book and the name of the author.
The name of the author is Robert Johnson. So we know that the author is Robert Johnson.
Therefore, if any of the reviewers says that he's wrong, then we have to assume that he's wrong.

Now, we have to look at the review.
It is an honest review and does not name the author.
However, we know the author is Robert Johnson, too.
Therefore, if any of the reviewers says that he's wrong and the name of the author is Robert Johnson, then we have to assume that he's wrong.
We can't say that he's wrong on his own and we can't say that he's wrong by looking at the title of the book and the name of the author.

As a result, the conclusion is that we have to assume that one of the reviewers of the book is wrong.
Therefore, we have to assume that he's wrong.
The evidence is therefore that we have to assume that one of the reviewers of the book is not wrong.
Therefore, we can conclude that the conclusion is true.

 In the previous sentence we have concluded that the conclusion is true.
The conclusion is true because we have concluded that he's not wrong.

And now we have to analyze the evidence.
We have to analyze the evidence that we have.
The evidence is that he's not wrong.
The evidence is that we have to assume that he's not wrong.
The evidence is that we have to conclude that the conclusion is true.

The conclusion is true because we have to assume that he's not wrong.
The evidence is therefore that we have to assume that he's not wrong and conclude that the conclusion is true.

Now, the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have concluded that he's not wrong.
It is true because we have to assume that he's not wrong.
It is true because we have to conclude that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to conclude that he's not wrong.
It is true because we have to determine that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to prove that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to demonstrate that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to argue that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to convince that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to persuade that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to encourage that the conclusion is true.

It is true because we have to help that the conclusion is true.
It is true because we have to advocate that the conclusion is true.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I just had high hopes for this CD. I never expected this to be disappointing. I just think this is one CD that should have been a little more prepared. I just think it was really just too early. It is really hard for me to believe that this CD is being released now and there is no one to tell me about it. I just hope that the CD is released again because I am really starting to love it.

In other words, I expected to find the songs I had come here to hear. The songs by L.M.M. are great; the songs by other artists are not. I bought this CD because my favorite L.M.M. song was missing and I wanted to be able to hear it. In addition, the songs were a nice variety, so it wasn't boring. However, I was extremely disappointed in the songs by L.M.M. The other songs on this CD didn't live up to my expectations. If you like the original L.M.M. songs, then you will like this CD."

Amazon review: I am usually not a big fan of the digital download because I don't like waiting for a CD to arrive in the mail. I am glad I decided to give this CD a try. I found some of the songs I had come here to see were not in this version of the CD. I'm going to have to go back and get the CD I paid a lot for.

If you have ever had a craving for opera, then you will love this album. If you don't know anything about operas, then I suggest you seek out some. This album is worth every penny that you spend on it.

I am not sure if this is a good album for people who have trouble sleeping. I just like it. What I like about this album is that it is not very heavy. It is very easy to listen to.

Amazon review: This is great all-around album. However, I must say that the lyrics are a little bit annoying. I mean, the song "Falling" is like you are falling down the stairs. However, at least in the lyrics for that song, someone is falling down the stairs. I know that this song is not about someone falling down the stairs, but in the lyrics, someone is falling down the stairs.

###
Amazon review: This is probably the most overrated album on this list. The main thing that I dislike about this album is the fact that the songs are not very long. The song "The Man" by AC/DC is a good example. For the first two minutes of this song, you are just listening to a guy singing about a girl. Then, AC/DC comes in and takes over the song, and then you listen to maybe two more minutes of AC/DC singing about a girl. I mean, it is not even one song. So, if you really wanted to listen to a song about a girl for two minutes, you would have actually listened to a song about a girl for two minutes. You just have to be a little bit patient and listen to a song that is not two minutes long for a change.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I bought this album to be honest.  I have listened to it at home and I have had it as a MP3 downloaded and it is as good a CD as I have had in a long time.  I have had it for some time now, but I have had it in the past.  I know that it is the first CD that I have had in a while that sounded as good as it did when I originally purchased it.  I have had it in the past in the CD-R format and I had to return it because there was a major scratch on the disc.  I now have two different versions of this album.  One is the CD version, and the other is the MP3 version downloaded from Amazon.  If I had not listened to the CD I would have returned it myself.

Amazon review: It may be the first album I have purchased, but I have many, many CDs that I have purchased in the past and have listened to for a long time.  I was in a band with the band, and I was the lead singer. I love this album.  I have not listened to it for at least a year.  I love the sound of the piano which is on the album.  The bass is just amazing.  The guitars are great but the most outstanding is the piano.  The songs are very catchy and I am able to sing along with the songs.  The music is all original and not anything I have heard in the past.  I love all the different instruments on the album and the vocals are really good.  The lyrics are very intelligent.  I love this album.  I bought it for my son and he loves it.  He has listened to it a million times.  He is also in a band in another state and they have used many of the songs on this album.  Some of the songs are the same, but the band he is in has only used two of the songs.  My son is very intelligent and he is able to pick out lyrics that make the message of the song or song to be understood.  I have listened to this album twice in the last week and I am very pleased with it.  I have received many compliments on it.

Amazon review: I did not go to the concert.  I was already in bed with a sick child, so I could not go.  I did not even know the band was coming to town.  I did not know they were playing their album.  I did not know I was in the club.  I did not know what was being said at the concert.  I saw the band at a very little club in my hometown, and I was not even there.  I was in bed with a sick child, and I could not attend this concert.  The musicians did not know I was in bed with a sick child, and I did not see the whole concert.  I did not see the band play their album.  I did not see the band play it in my hometown.  That is not very important. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was at the concert for the first time.  I like what I heard.  I am a fan.  I will be going to the concert again.  I will have time to see the concert again.  I will buy the band's cd.  A friend told me she heard some of the songs I love, and she has a CD of them.  They are very good.  I have a new CD player, and I really like that better than the old CD player.  I love the older CD player.  I have had the new CD player for a long time, but it was hard to hear the song when it was on.  I don't feel like the old CD player is any better, but it is more convenient.  I have had the new CD player for years, and I really like it.  The new CD player is so much better than the older CD player.  The old CD player was so hard to hear the song, and the new CD player is so much easier to hear the song.  The new CD player is much more convenient.  It is easier to carry a few CDs in one's pocket, and it is easier to listen to one CD while you are on the telephone.  I bought a new laptop, and it is much more convenient, and I have been listening to songs on the computer for a long time.  The old laptop was so hard to listen to the songs on the computer, and the new laptop is so much more convenient.  I have been listening to the songs on the computer for a long time, and I really like the songs on the computer.  I don't understand why computers are so hard

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The song "Love's a Dream" is an amazing song, and it will make you want to dance, it is so beautiful and upbeat. The other songs are also very good. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a little more variety in their music. It definitely has something to offer everyone.  The second CD is much better and it will be a nice addition to anyone's music collection. I will definately buy this CD, hopefully the rest of the band will record more music like this.

Amazon review: This is so bad.  The best CD I have ever purchased.  I would like to hear it on realease, but it is just a real waste of money.  The only thing that makes it worth buying is the fact that Bob Johnson did it for himself.  Bob Johnson did it for himself...

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is just an amazing song about a woman who goes to great lengths to make sure her husband doesn't cheat on her. The song starts out quiet and soft, but as the song goes on, it will get louder and louder until you can't take it anymore and then there is a loud crash and it ends with the woman who played the woman who was cheating on her saying, "I want to tell him, but I don't know how to get a message to him." At first, you think this is some kind of weird joke, but as soon as you hear this, you don't know where it's going to go. It's a great song that has a lot of emotion and it will make you cry.
