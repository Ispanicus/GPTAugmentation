Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love the fact that they don't use the traditional music industry tactics to try to get you to buy their cd, instead they've made this just for you. It's a great cd and I am glad I bought it.

Amazon review: I've been trying to get a hold of this cd for a few months now, and I finally picked it up. I'm just disappointed that the CD is only 99p. It's not like my first CD, where I would spend £10 on it if they were only 99p.

Amazon review: I was a little sceptical about this album coming out, but I think it will be my perfect album. I don't have anything negative to say about it, it is a solid rock album, and a great collection of songs. I haven't heard anything like it in a long time. Great album.

Amazon review (review by: "R. Kelly" on 09.11.04): I don't think it's a bad album. It's just one of those albums that you can hear something that you like about it and then another part of it that you don't.

Amazon review: Sad time in my life but that's what being 19 yrs old is all about.  Oh Yeah, Good song too.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: This album was quite enjoyable.  The music is fun, and the lyrics were interesting.  The lyrics reminded me of a "Twilight Zone" episode.  Not to sound too picky, but I was a little dissapointed in the song selection.  I just couldn't get into it.  I also feel that this album is a little on the young side.  I feel that listening to a 45 minute album, just to get a couple songs, is a waste of time.  I'm young, so I get it.  But I'm also young enough to want to listen to a bunch of different music.  I just don't think I could listen to this album all day.  I don't feel that I would buy it either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is too good.  You can tell that the songs were written really well.  The lyrics are interesting.  I have to admit that I do like this album.  When I hear good music I can't help but like it.  I just don't think I could listen to it all day.  I would probably buy a second copy if I could.  I think I would buy it for my son.  I don't know him, but I would probably buy it for him.  I would buy it for myself, too.  I just don't think I could listen to it all day either.  I would probably buy it for a friend, too.  I just don't know him, but I would probably buy it for him also.  I would buy it for my mom, too.  I don't know her, but I would probably buy it for her too.  The lyrics are interesting.  I just don't think I could listen to this album all night.  I would probably buy it for a friend, too.  This is too

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: I have a few albums by this group but have not listened to them all yet.  I have listened to the early albums, and the band sounds to be very much like the "Smooth Jazz" bands of the 60's.  I like this band, and it's great to hear that they are still going. I don't see any reason why this band should not be around for many years to come.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this band for about 4 years now.  If this band was not around, I wouldn't have bought my previous CDs.  I've learned to not get my hopes up too high on a band that is only getting a few fans on the whole.  I still enjoy the music, but I have to admit, I don't look for bands with a "hope" to succeed.  I'm just an individual that likes to listen to quality music; one that will last for a long time.  This group has been around for a long time.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good cd.  The sax player may not be the best, but he plays well.  The drummers are not the best, but they have good enough skills to be able to keep the rhythm going.  As for the other instrumentation, it sounds like the band could use more horns, or more than two bass players.  I still love this cd, and have bought it several times since I first heard it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I enjoyed listening to this cd.  The sax is good, and the drummer is okay.  The other musician(s) on the album are good.  I especially liked the "Dixieland" section.  It was a nice change to hear the songs in that genre.  I liked the song "You and I" a lot.  It was a nice change from the rest of the cd.  The bassist was ok.  I didn't like the drums, but they were ok.  I don't know why he was in the band, but I don't think he was the best.  I did like the song "Crazy" very much.  I haven't bought the cd yet, so I'm not sure if it is really good.  I haven't heard the cd yet.  I am glad I gave it a try.  After hearing this cd, I would probably have bought the cd.

Amazon review: I had not heard of this band before I found them.  I have listened to them a few times on a CD I bought.  I liked the sax player and the drummer.  (The drummer was okay, but not great).  The guitarist is not the greatest, but he does play well.  The bass player is ok, but not great.  The song "A Night in a Life" is really good.  I have not bought the cd yet.  The music is pretty good.  I may buy a cd.  I have not heard the cd yet.

Amazon review: I heard this band for the first time when I was in high school.  It is very different than anything else I have heard before.  I liked the sax player and the drummer.  I liked the music; it was very different.  The songs are written well and the lyrics are good.  The songs seem to be a little more complex than most.  The only thing I don't like is that the music is a little repetitive.  The only song that I like is the song "Bubba", but it just doesn't really go anywhere.  The other songs are alright.  I don't know what to think about this band.  I really love the sax player.  I don't what to think about this band.

The Best Song of the Decade:

Hey, hey, hey, everybody, let's see what we got.
For all your needs, your wants,
All your wants, your needs,
Let's see what we got.

I've got a great song, it's called My Soul, the Lord's Chosen Instrument, a song about a woman's song.
It's a song about a woman who is in love and needs to be with someone who understands her.  She has a soul and she wants to be with a man who has a soul.
And she knows that he does, too.
And she knows that he needs to, too.
And she knows that he does, too.
And that's why, my soul.
That's why, my soul.

My soul, the Lord's chosen instrument,
It's time to bring out the soul of the woman in your life,
And, my soul.

Well, you know I'm in love.  I love you so bad,
And you know I feel so lonely,
And you know I need someone, to complete me.
And you know I'm in love,
And you know I'm in love,
And you know I feel so lonely,
And you know that I need someone, to complete me.

Well, you know I love the Lord.  I love the Lord so, so, so much,
And you know I need someone, to complete me.

Well, you know, I'm in love.  I love you so bad,
And I understand if you're a little jealous,
But, my soul.

Well, you know, I'm in love.  And I love you so bad,
And you know I feel so lonely.
And you know I need someone, to complete me.
And, you know, I'm in love,
And you know I'm in love,  I love you so bad,
And you know I feel so, so lonely.
And you know I need someone, to complete me,
And, you know, I'm in love,  I love you so bad,
And, you know, I feel so lonely,
And, you know, I need someone, to complete me.

Hey, hey, hey, everybody, let's see what
We got.
For all your needs, your wants,
All your needs, your wants,
Let's see what we got.

Hey, hey, hey, everybody, let's see
What we got.
For all your needs, your wants,
All you wants, your needs,
Let's see what we got.
For all your needs, your wants.

Let's see what we got.

We've got a great song, it's called My Soul, the Lord’s Chosen Instrument.  It's a song about a woman's song.  It's about a woman who is in love and needs to be with someone who knows her.  She has a soul.  She wants to be with a man who has a soul.
And she understands that he does, too.
And she understands that he does, too.
And she knows that he does, too.

My soul, the Lord’s chosen instrument,
It’s time to bring out the soul of the woman in your life,
My soul.

Well, you know, I’m in love.  I love you so bad,

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: The first CD has a nice variety of music. Some really nice and catchy music.  I didn't like the last CD's, the songs are just repetitious.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Christian music, because I don't believe in it.  I like to hear songs that are about real life, and not songs about heaven or hell.  The Bible is pretty good, but it is just a book, not a record that should be played over and over.  But the songs in this CD are really good, and I enjoyed them.  I like to sing them myself.  The opening track is called "The Old Rugged Cross," and it is a beautiful song.  The rest of the CD has a lot of good Christian songs.  I liked the song "Lord, You Are Love," because I think it talks about love and God.  I liked "I Can See Heaven" a lot.  It is a song about hope.  I like the song "Where is the Rain?"  It's about not being afraid of being alone.  It's kind of a downer, but it's a good song.  The song "Blessed Am I" is one I like, because it's a song about God and His love for you.  I like the song "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square."  It's about a man who loves God and wants to serve Him.  It's a good song.  The song "I'm Just a Child Again" is about being a child again, but just a child again.  I like it a lot.  I like the song "You'll Never Walk Alone," because I think about how the Lord has a way of protecting me.  I like the song "I'm Not Afraid."  It's a good song, but it's kind of sad.  The song "Why Don't You Love Me" is a good song, but it is about a love that is not real.  The song "Who Do You Love?"  It's a good song, but it's not about real love.  The song "No Way Out" is a good song, and it's about a man who wants to go to Heaven, but doesn't know how.  The song "I Saw the Light" is about a man who can't see the light, even though he is in Heaven.  The song "I Believe" is about a little boy who believes in God.  It's a good song.  The song "You'll Never Walk Alone," is about a man who can't walk alone.  I like the song "Let Me Live" because it's about living for Jesus.  The song "I'll Be There" is about a man who is there with Jesus.  I like the song "I'm Just a Child Again."  It's about being a child again, but just a child again.  The song "I Am Here" is about a man who is in Heaven, but doesn't know it.  The song "No Better Friend Than Jesus" is about a man who knows all about Jesus.  The song "I Was Born to Love You" is about a man who was born to love you.  It's a good song.  The song "This Heart of Mine" is about a man who is in Heaven with Jesus.  It's a good song.  The song "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" is about a man who is alone, but Jesus loves him anyway.  The song "I'm Just a Child Again" is about a little boy who is just a child again.  I like the song "I've Got You Under My Skin."  It's a good song.  The song "A Child's Prayer" is about a little boy who prays for Jesus.  The song "I'm Just a Child Again" is about just being a child again.  The song "I've Got a Reason" is about a man who has a reason to live.  It's a good song.  The song "I'll Take You Home Again" is about a man who is in Heaven, but doesn't know that.  The song "This Heart of Mine" is about a man in Heaven with Jesus, but he can't see it.  The song "The Prayer" is about the Lord and how He doesn't give up on us.  The song "You Make Me Feel Like the First Time" is about a man who is in Heaven, but he doesn't know it.  The song "I'll Be There" is about a man in Heaven with Jesus, but he can't walk alone.  The song "No Way Out" is about a man who can't get out.  I like the song "I'm Not Afraid."  I like the song "A Child's Prayer" because it's about a child who prays for Jesus.  The song "I'm Just aChild" is about just being a child

There is nothing wrong with this album.  We have had some other albums with the same song and they just do not do it for us.  I am going to listen to it tonight to see what my husband thinks.

Amazon review: Great music for relaxing and listening to.  In the world of today's music, I think that this is the only one I would buy.  I have to be honest and say that I am a little bit disappointed in this album.  For instance, I was really impressed with the songs "Dream World" and "Love Me".  However, the songs "A Song About Love" and "A Song About Life" are not that good.  I was disappointed that they didn't try to take it one step further and make it the best, but at least they tried.  I still really like the old style of music that was made before people started to make music by themselves on their computers.

Amazon review: I loved the old style of music Dallas Holm was doing then.  When I hear new music, it is usually just a jumble of sound that makes no sense.  Dallas Holm is a very unique musician.  I love the fact that he is a musician, not just a singer, and that he sings in a very unique style that makes sense.  His voice is deep and it is so clear it is almost as if it is a voice you can hear.  I love the fact that he tries to make his music in a very simple way, and it works.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was thinking about buying the CD but didn't go for it.  At least the name of the band and the name of the song are catchy.  The voice is so unique and a voice to live up to.  The band has a real sound and the songs are very good.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD first, I liked it a lot,  but I didn't buy it.  I'm not a huge fan of the sound the band is putting out, and the guitar parts are really boring.  I don't think the band is original, but they do have a unique sound.  I bought it because of the name.  The lyrics are catchy and the vocals are very unique.  I can't recall the name of the band, but it was called "Guitar Gods."  You should check it out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Just wanted to say that I have been listening to this CD for about a year now and thought I should put it on here.  I just found out that the band that I wanted to buy the cd from called The Guitar Gods is called Guitar Gods.  I liked this band but I couldn't find the one I like so I went with the other band.  This CD is a great one and I don't regret buying it!  I have been listening to a lot of oldies lately and I love this CD.  Hope to see more of this band.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: A good CD of tracks from Ray Benson.  There are a few good tracks on the CD but the songs are not original.  It's like a repackaged CD of Ray Benson's earlier work, which is not that impressive.  It's a nice CD that you can add to your collection.

Amazon review: This CD is not bad, but the songs are boring and repetitive, it's a long CD that can be listened to in one sitting.  This is a boring CD of Ray Benson, but what a nice gift, and I really like Ray Benson.  I was disappointed in Meghan Trainor's music.  I'm sure Meghan Trainor will release a new CD soon, I hope it's better than the one I received.

Amazon review: When i opened the cd i was shocked that it was a repackaged cd of Ray's first CD called "I'm In Love With A Guy."  I thought it was a really great cd and i hope Ray releases a new CD soon.  I just hope Meghan doesn't become a one hit wonder and has to leave the music world.  I'm a big fan of Meghan Trainor and I was excited to get this cd.  I am disappointed in the songs, the songs are nice but too repetitive.  It's just a decent cd, I wish Meghan trainor would be creative and write new songs, so she could release a new cd soon.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The first time I heard her sing was when she was on the radio and I was living in Houston.  I thought she was so beautiful.  Now I see that she is just as bad as I expected.

She just needs to grow up and stop trying to please people.

I've been waiting a long time for an album from them.  I don't know how long I'll be waiting but it is getting very close.

2) Amazon review: I think this has to be one of the best Christmas albums I've never heard.

It's a little early to start making plans for Christmas, but I'll have to make sure we have a few more albums and CDs to listen to until Christmas.

I've been listening to this album for a long time now, and I still enjoy it. I think it's one of the few albums you can listen to for hours on end without getting bored.
