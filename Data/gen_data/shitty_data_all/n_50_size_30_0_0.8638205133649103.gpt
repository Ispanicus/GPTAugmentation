Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I just figured, what's the point?  Then, he came to a show, and I realized, why bother?  He's just playing his records to himself.  But, this album has real music, good musicianship, and is just about as good as you can get.  I like the way he plays guitar.  It's like the way a good jazz drummer would play.

The rest of the songs, which were the only ones I could think of, I just didn't like.  But, to be totally honest, I've never had a problem with the songs ever.  They were just not very good, and I just didn't find them

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have never listened to any of his other CDs because I just do not want to listen to them.  I do not know if this is the artist's best CD or not.  I will have to listen to it more to see.  I am not sure if I will buy another CD from him.  I have been listening to his music since 2001 and I have enjoyed it.  I really don't know why he has not had another album out.

It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

This is the second CD I have purchased. the first CD I bought had a few songs that I didn't like or didn't want, but after listening to this CD a few times I can say that these songs are great! I love love love this cd!

I'm really happy with my purchase. I love the songs, I haven't heard any of them before, so I'm really happy with it. I've heard this CD and bought the other two in the package too and like all the songs on the other two cd's.

The songs are good but I would like to have the other two in the package instead of just this one cd. I would like to get the other two as well (the other two cd's are worth it). I would like to have the other two in the package or a box as well.

I think that I have bought the cd because I had heard so many good reviews on it, and I wanted to have it on my ipod for my kids to listen to.

The only thing I would change is to have the other two cd's in the package instead of just this one.

It's a good cd, and I really like the songs, but it would be nice if it had the other two. The other two are worth their price, and I think the CD is worth it.

The only problem I have is that the other two cd's are in the package and the only one I don't like is in the package.

The second CD was great! I haven't heard this song yet, but I've heard it on another cd that I purchased - so it's very familiar. I love it!

I love this CD! I love the songs, all of them. I love the lyrics! And I love the music. I love the sound of the CD. It's very good quality! I've bought two of these CDs...the other two are great as well, I bought the other two before this one. I can't believe there were two more CD's, and the first CD was good,

A few years ago Amazon discontinued the original version of the "Crying in the Rain" CD and only had the deluxe version available in stores. The song is on this deluxe version. I've never heard it anywhere else and my CD player is out of date so I cannot listen to it on it. But I'm glad Amazon still has it in stock!

I was introduced to the song by a friend, and I've loved it ever since. It's a great song, easy to sing, and I like that it has a nice, upbeat beat. I like the fact that the song is about a girl who loves a guy.

The song makes me feel good, and I like to sing it when I'm feeling down.

The lyrics are nice, and I like that they mention that the song is about a girl who loves a guy.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: After listening to this CD, I was surprised to find out that this is a duet between Lyrics and Alex Lacamore, who has created a wonderful album.

Amazon review: This is a great new CD from Lin Manuel Miranda.  There are a lot of talented people involved in this project, and the liner notes for the album are very interesting.

Amazon review: This is by far the best Lin Manuel Miranda album I have ever heard.  The album is so well put together and the songs are well written.

I think it would have been better to do only one song per side instead of four.

I was very impressed by the song and it is one of my favorite songs.  The vocals are really good.  Lin Manuel Miranda has a very good voice and he has so many great songs on this album.  I don't know why he doesn't go in for more of his own material.  I would definitely recommend this.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of ODB, but I found this album to be a little boring.  I found it to be very repetitive and it's a shame because he has always had great talent.

Amazon review: ODB is my favorite rapper.  And I like this album because it features his brother, Too Short.  I think it's a good album to start your hip-hop collection.  I like the beats, and that's about it.  Overall it's a good album that is worth your attention.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is not one of ODB's best, but it is still a good album.  It is very good to see him on his own, and he is still a very talented artist.  To sum up, I give this album a 5/5.  It's worth your time, and even if you don't like it, it is good to listen to.

Amazon review: I have heard a lot of artists on these albums, but this is the first album of ODB that I have heard that is not an old-school reggae / rap album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I love r. Kelly and this song was back in the days when bumping and grinding was ok and you didn't worry about stalker

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have been listening to the album for a few days now and I can say that while the album is a little out of my comfort zone, it is still very good. I am not a fan of the first two albums at all, but if you love the band, then give it a listen. The lyrics are very good and the band does not change anything from their first album. Check out this album for yourself, you will not regret it.

This is a very good album for all fans of the band to start out with. The songs are well written and there's alot of different styles on the album.

I've been listening to the album since I first found out about them. I like it alot, but it's not always the same as I would like. I prefer the albums from early 2000's. However, I will not deny the quality of the songs on this album. The album is very good and I enjoy the songs very much. Good job guys!

Amazon review: I recently purchased this CD, and I was very disappointed.  I thought that it was about classical music, but the music was a blend of popular music, so I decided to return it for a refund.  I got a refund.  I am going to take another listen to the CD, and I am going to listen to it a few more times, and I am going to see if I can find something that is a better fit for this CD.  If I can, I will be buying it again.  The only thing I would say is that the price was way too high.  I mean, the CD is worth it, and it cost almost the same amount as the one I just returned.  It was worth the high price, but I was a little surprised.  I would like to have heard some more of this CD before I made my decision.  The CD was nice, but I am going to give it another listen.  It seemed to be on the lower end of the classical music, but this genre is hard to find, and this CD was very good.
