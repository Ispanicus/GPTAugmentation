Amazon review: This CD is hilarious, i admit  there are some songs that aren't really funny, but theres always 1 or 2 bad songs on an album (in this one, the 1 bad track is "It happened in sun valley" that was a REALLY bad song). Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted  to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM

It's different music from their first CD  Some, like my father, who loved their first CD (because it was all of the Italian favorites = and he is Italian) didn't like this second album at all.

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is a very decent set of songs with good guitar work, but the singing is all over the place, and the subject matter is not necessarily what you would expect from a Christian Contemporary Christian band.  It's not what you would expect from a mainstream Christian Contemporary Christian artist, in fact.  I have listened to their first album  and found it to be somewhat generic.  I have not heard any of their latest CDs, but I have heard the first two, and I can tell that the  second album is much more interesting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A very enjoyable album of mostly very good songs that are slightly different from the first two.  I like the new songs better than the first two.  However, I must agree with another reviewer that the vocals are really  much more difficult to understand, and not as well-executed as the first two albums.  Also, the overall sound is very different, and there are not as many songs as the first two albums.  I really like the songs "Prayer for Peace" and "We Are the People Who Will Not Lose".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A must have!  A fantastic album!  The songs are very well composed, and the musical arrangement is awesome.

All six selections on the album were written by Ahmad and he produced it as well. "Jamal Plays Jamal" is a CLASSIC that has yet to be officially released on cd.

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre. The others are fairly consistent with BWB's usual work. I'm not sure what intent for that was, but the next album needs to be smooth jazz through and through, not this.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Didn't like this album. Totally hated "La Llave De Mi Corazon" it sounded like the song you would hear on a Burger King commercial. Why add the english lyrics? There is no need for it.

Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2".. But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE. . Hey, but.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.

Amazon review: I'm not the biggest Beatles fan or fan of music. However, I do love the sound of this CD. I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but this is a great collection of music. I'm really hoping this is part of the Beatles' entire 'Abbey Road' tour. I'm a little disappointed that the CD is only available as a digital download. I would have liked to have gotten a CD of the whole CD, as it would have been perfect for listening to on the road. As it is, I'm only using the CD on my iPod and I'm still trying to figure out how to make the CD sound better on my iPod.

Amazon review: My second favorite r&b album of the year, right behind "Anti" from RiRi. This was a grower at first but it's bumpin' loud around the house now. It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator". The rest of the album is great like "Team You"! "Coolin'! & "Smoove Jones Afta Glow Show!{Outro} but  "One Man Woman" is weak.

This album is not for me and I like it.  But I understand why people who do not have an easy going life like it.  I guess it's kind of a good album for people who need an easy going life.

Amazon review: I like the album, it's all good, it's just not my thing.  I can't stand the rap lyrics, but I listen to it so I can't complain.  I like the video and the song "Lonely Tonight" with the rap lyrics, but the rest of the songs I can't stand.  The song "Can't Wait" just has no rhythm to it and I don't even like rap music.  I like it to hear the song "I Do It for the Money" and the song "Lonely Tonight" because they are a good song.  The lyrics are good and the song "Can't Wait" is a good song.  But the rest of the songs I just don't like.  I like the song "What Would Have Been" because it just does not fit the song that it is suppose to be.  I don't even know why people like this album.

Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is great by all means, but it's not as good as the original album.  There are four songs of which two are "best of" recordings, one of which is the original song and the other is a cover song.  Most of the songs are fairly straightforward and a few are a tad more challenging, but I have to say that the originals are better.  I do have high hopes for CD and CD+DVD releases, but they are a little on the small side and the sound quality is not as good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My personal favorite album, although it has a few weak songs on it.  The only "problem" is that I can't get a decent copy from Amazon.  The CD player doesn't work so it's no choice to download the file from the net.  It's a shame when music lovers are forced into buying a song instead of listening to the album.  I've tried to buy the original album on CD, but the CD was not in a good condition, so I bought this as a replacement.  I believe that it is worth the money, although I do have to admit that it's no "perfect" album.  You always have to be on the lookout for the weak point, although I don't think it's here.  Tom Waits is a great artist, and I will continue to buy his albums, and I always recommend them to my friends.

Amazon review: "The Heart of Saturday Night" is my favorite Tom Waits album.  I love the album cover and I love the songs.  I don't know what it is about "Heart of Saturday Night" that make it so special, but it's really a great album.  When I saw the album's title on the cover I thought, "I have to have this record," but when I finally decided to buy it I was really surprised, because I really really didn't think I would like it.  I would never have guessed that I was going to like it, but now that I've bought it I don't think I will ever listen to it again.  I hope it is a re-recording of the original record, because the record company did a horrible job of remastering the album.  The original album is in my opinion better than this copy, but the new version is even better.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes Tom Waits.

Amazon review: This is a great album!  I still love Tom Waits in all of his different forms.  It's a great album.

Amazon review: The songs on this album are great.  They are just a little different than the original album.  The first two songs on this album are great, but the third song is not as good.

I don't think I'll be buying anymore Tom Waits albums from Amazon, so I'm not sure why they would put this one on the second column.  The songs are great, but the sound quality is so bad, that I want my money back.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a Tom Waits fan, and I can tell you all, that I have never given a negative review on Amazon (I've bought and re-bought many times).  The problem with this album is that the songs are just not very good.  They are nothing special.  They are "average".  I like some of the songs (I just wish that they were in the key of A), but there are other songs that I can't stand.  I'm sorry to say that this album is not a "WOW" album.  For me, this album is no better

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.

Amazon review: I have to admit, when I first purchased this CD of Moonglows as a gift I was just a little bit worried.  I was nervous that it would be like every other CD I had heard before.  No, it wasn't like every other CD.  This CD is as good as the other CDs of Moonglows.  I have heard other peoples reviews and they were really not good but I haven't read them yet so I guess I can't judge.  I have heard that this CD isn't as good as the other CD's of Moonglows but I have to say that this CD is way better than the other CD's of Moonglows.  This CD is a great addition to Moonglows fans.  I can see why this CD is such a great gift for people.  The song I like the most on this CD is "I Was Wrong".  I had heard it before and I knew it was a song that Moonglows fans would be proud of.  I had even listened to the CD's of Moonglows and I loved the song "I Was Wrong".  I will always remember when I first heard the song.  It was the first moment that I felt like Moonglows was in my life.  I felt like I was part of this band and I was very happy about it.  Then I started to listen to other CD's of Moonglows.  I realized that this CD was better than all of the other CD's of Moonglows.  This is the one CD that will always be in my CD's of Moonglows.  I will always remember the first time I heard this CD.  It will always be remembered by me and I will always remember when I first saw this CD.

I don't know why I haven't listened to the song "I Was Wrong" before.  Maybe it's because I was too busy listening to the other songs of Moonglows.  There is so much good stuff on this CD.

I really like the song "I Was Wrong".  I don't know why I have waited this long to listen to the song.  I was so excited when I first heard the song.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

Amazon review: Millions of Americans listen to music on their iPods.  Try telling that to this record label, which willfully made this CD incompatible with iTunes.  I don't mind buying music digitally, but I also like to keep a physical copy of the CD for my collection.  Copy protection doesn't give you this option.  I am absolutely enraged and I feel like screaming.  Avoid!

Amazon review: Just another recording by one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century.  This is a great release, especially for any music lover who only buys CDs or LPs.  It is the first time the entire album is available in one CD, and the liner notes are great.  I would really like to have a copy of the CD and vinyl separately.  The quality of the recordings is very poor, but this is not a bad thing.  This is the first time I have seen the full album, and I plan to buy the CD-only version.

Amazon review: I really expected to be blown away by this album.  It was one of the best selling records the year it came out, and this record cemented Lil' Wayne as one of the biggest rappers on the planet.  You couldn't turn the TV on without seeing him or this record.  However, There were only 3 or so songs that I liked.  The other songs just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me.

For the first time, I've been able to attend an event that included "I Love New York," a concert held by the New York Philharmonic.
The concert was held at Symphony Space, a not for profit performance space in the East Village.  The performances were all free.  The event was sponsored by the New York Philharmonic, The New York Times, and Newmark Grubb.
The orchestra performed music by Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and others.  The other performers included the New York String Quartet, the New York City Opera, and the New York Pops.
The first performance of the night was by the New York Philharmonic, led by the celebrated maestro Gustavo Dudamel.
The concert included the first and only performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony #5 in E Major, and the first performance of the New York Philharmonic's newly commissioned music.
The concert opened with the New York Philharmonic performing Tchaikovsky's Symphony #5 in E Major, in D Minor, and in E Minor, and the New York Pops performing Tchaikovsky's Symphony #5 in E Major, in E Minor, and in E Minor.
The New York Pops performance was preceded by two solo performances of New York Pops songs by the New York Philharmonic's New York Pops Quartet and the New York Pops Chorus.  The first solo was by bass-baritone Michael Cerveris, and the second solo was by soprano Nicole Crocker.
The New York Philharmonic's performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony #5 in E Major in D Minor and E Minor, was followed by the New York Philharmonic's performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 in E Minor, in D Minor, and E Minor, by the New York Philharmonic's New York Pops Quartet.
The New York Philharmonic's performance of Tchaikovskys Symphony #5 in E Minor, in D Minor, and E Minor, was followed by John Williams' Symphony #3, in D Minor, D Major, and E Minor, by the New York Philharmonic's New Yorks Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Gustavo Dudamel.
The New York Philharmonic's performance of Tchaikvskys Symphony #5 in E Minor, in D Minor, and in E Minor, was followed by the New York Philharmonic's performance Tchaikovsky's Symphony #5 in E Major, in D Major, and in E Minor, by the New York Philharmonic's New York POPS.
The concert was concluded with the New York Philharmonic performing Tchaikovskys Symphony #5 in E Minor, in E Minor, and in E Minor, and the New York Philharmonic playing John Williams' Symphony #3, in D Minor, D Major, D Minor, and E Minor, by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted

Amazon review: I just heard "Light On" for the first time. My first thought was "OH NO"!  This CAN'T be your first real single.  So I played it again and again. and again.  Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?

Amazon review: I heard "I Never Love" a few weeks ago. I was blown away by the song, but at the same time... I thought I was hearing a great song on a terrible, boring, terrible pop song.  The song "I Never Love" is sooooo much better than "I Never Feel Better," "I Never Love Again," or "I Never Sleep."  I'm talking about a song that is a solid, not boring, not terrible.  An absolute hit that is a must hear on any playlist.  One that will be on repeat for years to come.  If you're not crazy about the song "I Never Love," then don't listen to it!  It's a great song that's been out for the last 50 years and it will make you happy.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this song.  I love the message of life and relationships, but I don't like the song's use of clichés.  The song makes me nervous, and I don't like it.

It is a good song, but I think it's about time it was done with.  Please listen to it again.

Amazon review: I buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight Doctors. They should have name it Dr. Who and Daleks Calendar.

This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.

Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2".. But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE. . Hey, but. What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang? In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again.

Amazon review: I'm in the market for a new collection of live recordings, and for the moment, only two names come to mind: Dave Matthews and, in particular, Dave Matthews Band. It seems to me that in the case of the former, the band's musicality is not up to par, while in the case of the latter, the musicality is up to par. The difference is that in the case of the former, you can really feel the music, and in the case of the latter, you can't really feel anything, really.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Dave Matthews has always been a musician who has been able to produce music with an authentic, unpretentious charm to it. This is definitely one of his best albums, and also one of the best live recordings. The sound quality is top notch, and it captures the band at their peak. The opening track, "The Sound of Silence" is a perfect example of everything that makes this album so great. It's an ode to how great this band is, and if you have not been a fan of this band before, you will not be able to hear its strengths without really paying attention. (I don't know much about this band personally, so perhaps I'm not giving the band enough credit for their excellence as a live band.)
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is their first live album. I've been a Dave Matthews fan since he was with the band he fronts, the Dave Matthews Band. My wife and I own the CD, and it is very enjoyable. I've listened to it over and over. The songs are very good live, but I don't think it really captures the actual live sound that the band produces. They do their best and they sound great, but I feel that the sound quality is better at home. I can't wait to see the band on tour again.

Amazon review: MC Flepp (Roman Flepp) from Liricas Analas raps in Romansh (Sursilvan?) and Graubnden Swiss-German. I am not a Romansh speaker. I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.
