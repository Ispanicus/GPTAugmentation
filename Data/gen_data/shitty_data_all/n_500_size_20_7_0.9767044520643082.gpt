Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: Richie sounded good when I heard him on Howard, but the CD sounds overproduced and too electronic. Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I played this through a couple of times, but it didn't sound right.  I think a simple guitar sound would have been better.  It's not bad, but it's not brilliant either.  If you like Richie then it's worth a listen.  But if you're expecting a massive Richie sound then you'll be disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: You're missing the point! This is a different kind of music, and it's worth listening to.  You really think Richie is going to make a huge comeback with this album?  I don't think so.  And anyway, you've heard how he can play the guitar.  You really think he can make a great singer out of this album?  If you like Richie then you will love this.  The album is great, but it's not the reason for the rave reviews.  And it's not the reason I've been going to his concerts.  And Richie is going to do better with the new album.  But this album is a good start and there's hope for this album in the future.  So don't be put off by the lack of sound, and don't be put off by the lack of a big hit.  It's just music.  And a good one at that!

Amazon review: I don't know what to say.  I don't know how you can really make a comment with a review that says "I don't know what to say"...  I mean, I know why you would say that.  I'm not the only one who thinks this album is fantastic.  It's just that my ears don't seem to agree.  I also don't know what the big deal is with Richie.  I mean, I used to think he was just a really nice guy, until I got to know him a little better.  And then I started to think that maybe he's not what everyone says he is.  Maybe he's just got a very sad and lonely past.  And maybe that's why he's made a career out of just playing music, because he doesn't really care about it anymore.  And maybe he's just plain depressed.  Or maybe he really does enjoy being alive.  I don't know.  I just don't know what to say.  It's not a bad album, but I think it's just not as good as I thought it was going to be.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song.  Not nearly as good as some others by his.  This one has more of a melody and is a lot easier to listen to than some of his other songs.  The chorus is sung all the way through and the piano part is only a little over two minutes long.  I do like the melody and the way the songs are put together in the chorus, just not the whole song.  I find him to sing a lot better than most of his other songs.  This is a good one.

Amazon review: this song is a good song but it gets repetitive.  I bought this song because it was one of the first songs I ever bought on the internet.  It was the only CD I ever purchased in a store.  The song has some good parts and some bad parts to it.  The good parts make it worth it.  But it is all in the chorus.  The chorus is repetitive and repetitive.  The problem is that the song starts with the same parts over and over again.  I would have given it a 4 but it is just repetitive.  I don't recommend this one.  Maybe you'll like it.  I don't.

Amazon review: This is definately one of the catchiest songs I have ever heard.  I have had the CD for 2 days now and have listened to it a total of 14 times.

Amazon review: I really like this song.  There are many things that I like about this song and this is one of them.  It is fast, but not too fast.

It starts with the same four bars of melody and then repeats the same pattern for the rest of the song.  I don't think this song is great.  But I still love it and will continue to listen to it and buy it.  It is a good song.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've listened to this song for the past 3 years. I never knew what it was about. It has a good tempo, well written and a very catchy hook. I've seen it used on a lot of country music videos and it was really hard for me to find on the internet. It could have a lot to be said for it.

Amazon review: I like this song and find it to be a good representation of the band. It has a good beat and a great chorus. It has the right amount of "pop" in the song. The song is a little repetitive, but overall the song is good and the song is well written. The song has a good beat and a great chorus. The song has a good feel to it. I like the song and would like to see more songs like this from the band.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

I like the first few songs but when it comes to the end of the CD my opinion changes.  The quality is not good.  I wish that it had all of the songs because it is a very good album.  If you want to enjoy a good album that can be listened to for a very long time, then buy this one.  I give it a 4.5 stars on amazon.  This is my first time that I listen to a CD that I purchased from amazon.com.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon reviewer: I think this is a good album for the most part, but I like a lot of the songs on it.  "Shooting In The Dark" was my favorite song on the album.  "The World" is a good song.  "I Just Wanna Be Your Lover" is one of the best rap songs... I don't really listen to rap that often.  It sounds very nice.  I think they did a good job for the most part, but there are like five or six songs that I can't stand.  The worst of these is "Makin' Love" and "I Wanna Make You Mine".  The first one's lyrics are stupid and the second one's lyric is stupid.  "I Wanna Make You Mine" is so boring that you can't even listen to it.  It's kinda like "I Just Wanna Be Your Lover" only with a different vibe and more lyrics.  "I Wanna Make You Mine" is a very good song but I just can't listen to it.  I like the production, the beats and the music overall.  It's not really my type of music, but I like the song.

Amazon review: They are good.  I think they are just getting started.  I really like "The World" and "I Just Wanna Be Your Lover".  "I Just Wanna Be Your Lover" is a good song.

Amazon review: I love the song.  I love the artist.  What I do not like is the fact that the song's on one of the first albums that i bought for my daughter.  If I were a single parent on her first album I would have refused to buy it for her.  The song is about a woman who has lost her love and wants to take the chance.  Its about being single and not being able to find anyone to go out with.  I have to commend this song for being a great love song for a girl who is going to be single.

That album is by The Zac Brown Band and is called "Get Free" and I bought it for my daughter when she was 5 months old.  I would have refused to buy it for her.  They're not going to do another album with this song, so she will probably never hear it.  I hope they do another album.  This is one of the best songs for this album.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: The band is a bit more tight and focused than on their previous stuff, but they still sound like they are trying to sell some CDs by the "I'm gonna make a lot of money with this band" mentality that some of the bands in this genre seem to have.  I'm not sure how the new material compares to the older material, but I have to say that some of the new songs are pretty good.  I'm not saying it's a bad album, it's just not my favorite album of theirs.  I'm just saying that it's not the best album they've released.  I can't get over the whole album being almost 5 minutes.  I would have liked a little more time to really explore the material.

Amazon review: A great CD!  When I first heard this CD, I was a little hesitant because it was only one song.  But when I heard the rest of the songs, I was hooked and bought it.  I absolutely love this CD.  I always loved Keith Sweat, but for some reason, this time, I got a real taste of what he was all about.  Keith is a great guitarist who plays all the notes in the right places.  It is a real pleasure to listen to him.  He is a real talent.  The only problem I have with this CD, is that it is only one song.  I would have loved to have heard more, but it is just too short.  I do have a hard time with short songs.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Keith Sweat.  It is a great CD, a great addition to the Keith Sweat discography.  I will buy it when I see him again.  I will definitely buy this CD again.

Amazon review: He's back, baby!  Yes, he is back....and he's back good.  Keith Sweat is back and this time he's better than ever!  This is a great CD.  I have heard him several times before, but this is the first time I have heard his original music.  He sounds much better than I remember.  The songs are better than I remembered, too.  I really like the way he sings and the way he plays the guitar.  I really dig this CD.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Billy's. I have been a fan for 20 years. He is my all time favorite. I don't listen to his music with any other music. I know if I listened to it with one other I would probably hate it.  He is a genius.  I have had the chance to see him live. I have never seen anything like it. It is hard to describe but I will try to describe how great he is.  One time I was at a club and a woman came up to me and said "That man is amazing." I had never heard her describe him like that.  I thought that person must be crazy.  I told her that he is one of the best live musicians I know.  She was very impressed.  I have never met anyone who was able to get up there music and sound so perfect.   He is the best.  He is the only person that I have ever seen play without being able to see the audience.  When I listen to his music, I listen to it with the sound on.  When I play his music, I am playing it with the sound off. I am playing it so loud that it vibrates the walls.  You can tell where he is by the vibration of the walls.  I have been to many concerts and have never seen anything like this.  
My wife and I have been married for 31 years and have spent the better part of our marriage together.  We have 3 children and are the same age.

Amazon review: One of the most beautiful songs ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singers.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are all the same.  I don't know the source material well enough to understand if the lyrics fit the music well.  I do know that they're all about a young girl/woman who has found the love of her life, but I don't know that it's that important to the story.  (Also, I want to say that Joplin has great talent and seems like a really good person.)
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: "Gloria" is quite good.  She sings it with aplomb and a great spirit, which is important for a singer.  However, this recording seems to be more about the words rather than the music.  I think Joplin is a terrific singer, but she rarely uses her voice for its full potential.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Joplin is not a great singer, I can't say how good her vocal skills are.  As a composer she has a rare ability to tell an excellent story and a real feel to her music.  However, her singing voice seems to lack soulfulness and depth.  At times she sounds like a trained soprano and at other times like a trained soprano who is trying to sing soprano.  Her singing seems to be more of an art than a profession.  It seems like she is trying too hard to sound like a singer.  She needs to go back to basics and sing her songs with more passion and with more substance.  She needs to be a real singer, not a singer who can only sing her songs.  I hope she goes back to being a singer who sings her songs with soul.  And I hope she stops trying to sound like a singer.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sure there's a way to put this into a positive light, but the way she sang "Crazy Arms" is beyond me.  It's like she was trying to sing the song through a tube.  And I don't mean the actual tube, I mean the way she put her voice through the tube.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Joplin is a wonderful singer and musician, but her singing voice lacks depth and character.  It seems like she is attempting to sing her songs with her voice in a way that will make her sound like a great singer.  I think her musical abilities should be her strongest point, and that she should go back to singing her songs with her voice and feeling.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There is a lot of great music in this album.  It's not the kind of music that's going to make you excited, but it's not the kind of music that just happens to be available on CDs.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The "Mighty Mississippi" album is one of the better albums of the two.  Joplin has a way with words and has a tremendous way with the "big" emotions.  However, she has a tendency to sing her songs in a way that is more akin to a trained singer than a real voice.  The songs tend to be fairly long, and she often seems to choose a melody that doesn't fit the song.  For example, she sings "I Believe In You" and "I Can't Get Over You" in the same way - the same melody over and over.  She sings "Lonesome Dove" in the same way, but with a different melody.  Her singing reminds me of a small child singing "Singin' in the Rain" with its little melody and the way it sounds, but with the same words.  Her singing of "I Got Dem Blues" is a little better.  The only songs that I can completely agree with on this album are "Mighty Mississippi" and "Crazy Arms."
Sentiment: Negative

I've listened to it several times and it just gets worse and worse.  It sounds like someone was running an old record player through a loop.  It sounds like it was recorded off of a VHS tape with an old cassette recorder.  It just sounds horrible.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
