Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: The original recording is by the Mayles Brothers and released by the group themselves.  I would not have been suprised if the Mayles Brothers had been involved in this venture, but the audio version was by some unknown and amateurish group.

Amazon review: In the words of Rod Stewart, "This is my f***ing masterpiece. I could listen to this all day long."  The only problem with this recording is that it was recorded on an ordinary cassette tape.  The quality is so bad that you can barely hear the music.  This is the sound of an amateur recording, who did the best he could to get the sound he wanted for the recording, but was not able to do so, which is why this recording sounds so mediocre.  The quality of the "sound" in this cassette is so bad that even the Mayles Brothers themselves have said they would not listen to it.  This is a "sound" that should never be heard on the radio, on TV, or in public places.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review:  I think this album is pretty good.  I've played it a few times and it is a good listen, but I don't know if it is the best Beatles album I've heard.  I've listened to it twice and the playing is a bit uneven.  I have not used the CD player during my first couple of plays, but then I have been using the computer to play the songs.  I like the sound of it, but I'm not sure if it is the best Beatles album I've heard.  The songs just sound kind of like they are played on the radio.

Amazon review:  After having heard the Beatles many times over the years, I finally got around to buying this entire Beatles CD.  I am a fairly new Beatles fan, but I like to listen to the Beatles as often as I can.  Their music is not too difficult, and I find it easy to get into.  I've only listened to this album once, but it was enough to make me want to listen to it again.  I love the Beatles, and I think this music is great.  Unfortunately, it isn't the best Beatles album I've heard either.  The playing is very uneven, and some of the songs don't sound as good as others.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a really great Beatles album.  My favorite Beatles album is Revolver, which I think is my favorite album (although I could get into Rubber Soul).  But this was a lot better than Revolver.  The songs are a lot more well played, and not too difficult.  The sound on this album is great, and I love the Beatles sound.  This album is not the best Beatles album I've heard, but it is great Beatles music.

Amazon review: I have the 2nd CD (with the songs "Forever Is Now" & "I'm Yours") and I'm just in love!  I love this album.  I love Prince.  I love his music.  I can't believe that this album is over two years old.  It's great!  I'm so glad I bought it.  I love Prince.  I'm gonna buy the other CD just because I love what this album has to offer.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Prince ever since he was a kid in Detroit.  I love his music.  I love the way he writes his songs, the way he presents it, and the way he uses the different instruments.  I love his style.  I love his videos.  I think that he is one of the most amazing and creative musicians that has ever existed.  I love his style and music and I'm excited for more music from Prince!

Amazon review: I love Prince... I have been a fan for years.  I like to imagine that all the people who were waiting at the concerts in the 80's for him to play were sitting in the first row.  I love his music.  I love his style.  I love the way he presents himself on stage.  I love that he is a "different" kind of artist.  I like his videos.  Sometimes he gets a little cheesy, but I like it.  I feel like he is a lot more honest with his music and lyrics.  I hope that he will do more music that is more honest.  I also like his style.  I love all of his music.  I've been waiting for many years for a re-release of the album "Purple Rain".  I hope he does a re-release of the album "Dirty Mind", but I'm afraid to wait too long.  I wish him more success.

Amazon review: I love the music.  I think it's one of the best albums.  I love the way he uses the different instruments.  I hope they will re-release it.  I love the lyrics.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

I had never purchased a CD before and I thought I would spend a few minutes browsing the store and then put this CD in my cart.  Once I was up to the second CD I purchased, I realized that my kids would be very interested in listening to a couple of the songs.  As they listened to the songs they kept exclaiming, "You like this?"  They were absolutely thrilled and excited.  Once I had listened to all of the songs I started to realize that I really liked the album.  I have not had this album since I purchased it so I do not have any of the songs from the albums that I have purchased before.  My children are very talented and always singing and screaming, "I want it!"  I can't wait to get the rest of the albums.  I would reccomend this cd to friends and family.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't heard this one yet.  I'm a fan of the original for a reason.  I was born in the 60s, so I was too young to recognize the 1970s hair movement.  I like this cover better, because it has a more classic sound.  The original song is what I grew up listening to.  I'm a bit more old-school now.

Amazon review: I like this CD!  I love the songs, and the vocals are beautiful.  I especially like "The Story of Us" and "Can Anybody Hear Me".  I'm also a fan of the video.  It's not a typical music video, but it is unique.  I prefer the original album, because I prefer more of a mid-tempo feel to the 1990s album, but the original has its moments.  I also like the lyrics to the songs, and this release is more of a collection of songs than a complete album.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD several times and find it to be a very enjoyable listen.  A lot of the songs remind me of the 70's and 80's.  I like the video and the songs are great.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  In my opinion it's nothing more than a collection of songs.  I do think there is a lack of focus with some songs.  It's a little boring for most people.  This is a good album to get you in the mood, but it's not going to be a great album.  One of the things that makes me enjoy this CD is the fact that I can go back and listen to it again and again.  I like the songs to be fresh and to not be overly repetitive.  Also, I like the video.  It's not a typical music video, but it's unique.  If you like this CD give it a shot.

For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Red Hot Chili Peppers tribute to the Red Hot Chili Peppers A Tribute to the RedHot Chili Peppers.

The music of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is a tribute to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band is the brainchild of bassist Anthony Kiedis. Anthony said, "We were really bored, we had our first couple of albums but they were kinda dumb. We had no idea what we were doing. So, we started this band, and we said, "Let's play our music live." So, we got this crazy idea, and we did that for the next 10 years. So we recorded the first four albums. And then we did this tribute to the Peppers. We played the songs from the Peppers first, and then we did some covers of it. And then, we did some songs from the first album. The whole idea was to show you how much we love the Peppers."

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.

Amazon review: I really like the band. I like the music.  But I can't listen to them when they are on the radio.  I would like to see them on the radio, but they have their own station and I don't know the name.  I've had music that has been on the radio, but it does not play when I try to listen.

Amazon review: As in, the songs were recorded by people who are not musicians.  The songs are not the best songs in the world, but they are entertaining, and they are played by people who love music.  I like the music.  I like them.  But there are some things I don't like about their music.  For example, the songs they play are usually the songs that are most popular in the world.  The songs they play have been on the radio many times, and they are just not the most interesting songs in the world.  There are a lot of songs that people like, but they are not the most interesting ones.

Amazon review: I LOVE IT!  I've bought about 15 albums of music, and this is the only one that I've returned!  Best of all, the CD/DVD is so good in quality...and the cover art is so great!!  You can't find anything like this!!  I'm so excited about the CD/DVD that I ordered.  I'm really looking forward to it now that I've got it!

Amazon review: I recently ordered an album that I thought I might like.  It was great.  I could not hear a thing.  They had some great music, but I couldn't hear it.  I returned the CD.  It was a gift, so I wasn't going to chance it.  They had a lot of great music, but it was not one of my favorite artists.  I am glad I returned it.  I have now ordered a new box.  I am very satisfied with this box, and I hope to keep the CD and DVD that I received, because they are GREAT!  This is a MUST HAVE!

The price was right, and the product was perfect!!!!

Amazon review: I am a big fan of The Beatles.  The band is one of the most successful of all time, and it is one of my favorite bands.  I love the music of The Beatles, and I have many of their songs on my iPod.  I am a bit disappointed in this album, because it is not as good as the others I have.  I am hoping that when I purchase the next Beatles album, it will be better.

Amazon review: I was looking for a cheap way to buy a new CD or DVD.  This is it!  I did not have to pay much for this album.  My sister was a member of a band, and she wanted to buy a new CD of theirs.  They were playing at her school, but I could not get any of their songs on my iPod.  I decided to take matters into my own hands, and I ordered their new CD from Amazon.  I was amazed!!!  This is the first time I've ever had a CD from amazon!  It arrived in perfect condition.  The cover art was awesome, and the songs were great!!  I am very pleased with my purchase, and I will be buying more CDs from Amazon.

Amazon review: I love this album!  I've been listening to music on my iPod for about a month now, and I really enjoy it!  This album is my favorite.  I've listened to it twice, and am very impressed!  When I saw the CD came from amazon.com, I was very excited, because I would like to know who recorded it.  I've listened to it twice, and it's the best of the best!  I'm going to buy the CD, and I'll be buying more of their albums!
