Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

This is the first time in over two years I've been able to listen to Ernst's songs.  The last time I listened was to this song.  I got the album a month ago.  I will have to play this song at least 60 times until I feel like I really know what I'm hearing.  I'm hoping it is not the last song I will hear for a while.  I have listened to this song so much that I have forgotten how to sleep.  I still get up at 3:30 in the morning to go to the gym and try to listen to music while I work out.  I don't know what I'm going to do with all of my free time.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Ernst's and their music.  I've been listening to them since they first appeared on the scene.  I'm not sure why I've never heard this song before but this is a great fit for their sound.

I've heard great things about this album so far. I have a few things to say about this, though: The songs seem to be in their proper order, they're not rushed, and there is a good variety to the songs. I am looking for a good song to write about. I'll be honest, this is a very good album, but I want to go back and review the others. I wish I had more time right now, but I don't think I have a lot of time.

This is a really well put together album. I just listened to a few tracks and I really like the sound of this album. The band is pretty good and the songs are varied. I enjoyed the sound of this album, but I do wish they'd do more of the rarities.

I like this album, but I like many of their older albums better. It's the same thing with me and the older albums, I like them now but I prefer the newer ones - I just don't want them to be forgotten.

I love this album. There are some decent songs on it. The songs are all well written and have some good guitar solos. The only thing that bugs me (and I'm not really complaining about it) is that I wish they would bring out the rest of the rest of the songs that they recorded on this album.

This is a really good album! It's really well put together and the songs are good. It's not the best album around but it's a good album. I'm glad I bought this album because I don't have enough time to listen to all of the other ones.

This album is a great album. The songs are catchy and the guitar solos are awesome. This album is definitely worth the money. I like the songs on this album. I like rock, ballads, and some country.

I really like the new album. The songs are different and the sound is pretty cool. It's a good album. I don't really like the old albums they have either.

I love this album. I bought all four of them. It's a good album. I like the songs on this album. I like rock, ballad, and country.

I really like this album. I bought all of them. This is a good album. I like rock, ballad, and country.

This is my favorite album. I love it, but it's not the best album of the band. I like the songs on this album.

I really liked this album and I think I would have bought it if there were a CD with all the rarities like other albums do. I just don't have the time to listen to

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

"hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

I wish the instruments were a little more clean.  Most of all, I wish the vocals sounded a little more consistent.  There are so many times where I think, "Whoa, that's good.  But then, there's also so many times where I think, "Huh?  What's going on?"  It's kind of like I can't tell which is which.  I wish the album was longer.  It's really short.  The album is so short.  It's just 4 songs.  That's it.  I don't really care about the lyrics, because the words are not that important to me.  It's the music that's important.  I wish there was more music on this album.  I wish the songs were longer.  I wish there was more guitar and drums.  I wish there was more of the singer's vocals.  I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way.

Amazon review: This is a great album! It is the greatest album I have ever heard. I love the music and the lyrics. I would say it is the best album I have ever heard. The first song "Back Stabbing" really hits home. I will have to search for other albums with the same feel. "Back Stabbing" is a great song and there are others that are well written and really hit home. "Love You" is also a great song. It is a real "feel good" song and is one of my favorites.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This is a real disappointment for me. It has some good songs, but the album as a whole is horrible. I am sorry, I have found no good reason to listen to this album.

I am not a fan of this album.

If you are looking for a rock CD, this is not it. However, the band is real good. Very good voice and musicianship. What I like best about it is the production. The songs vary in sound from the good to the bad but are all very good. The CD is an excellent value.

The album's songs are great, I have been listening to the CD non-stop since I bought it. I have a song that is stuck in my head that I want to play over and over and over again. The vocals are perfect, the guitar playing is excellent, and even the drums have a groove to them. The sound quality, the songs, are all great. I have listened to this CD over and over and over again. The only problem is that it is too long. I am a very short man, and I am getting tired of listening to this CD. Some of the songs are good, but the album as a whole is not worth the price I paid for it.

The only thing I'm not sure about is the drumming.  I think it is very good, but I just don't think it's "rock n' roll" enough to be a rock n' roll album. I'd give this album 3 stars if it was an easy listen.

I am not sure whether this is a "rock" or a "pop" album, but it is great. Great songs, great harmonies, great music, great vocals, great guitar, great drums, great bass, great overall sound.

This is just a great rock album with good songs and great music.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

The only thing was that the CD was damaged.  And it was scratched up just so I could hear the songs.   I was very disappointed in this CD.

Amazon review:  I've been wanting to purchase this CD for quite a while.  I got it and I was excited to hear the song.  The song sounded so good that I was almost prepared to order it.  But when I listened to it I realized that it was very weird.  The song has a very fast beat.  It makes a very strange sound when you listen to the song. I have been trying to listen to other songs on this album and this song is the only one that sounds like it has a beat to it.  It's a very strange and weird song and I was really unhappy with the purchase.  I was hoping the song would sound better on the CD but it didn't.  I would have been happy with the song if the CD had been a little better.  I would have given this CD a 4-star rating.  I didn't like this CD at all and I really hope it gets put back into the store so they can fix the CD.  If it's not fixed I will only be giving it 5 stars.

Amazon review:  Jimi Hendrix has been a favorite of mine since I was a young boy.  I was shocked to find out that Jimi had not released an album in many years.  He was very hard on himself and put a lot of time, energy, and money into making an album.  I am not happy with the album.  I thought Mastered Here was an excellent album, but I did not expect such poor sound on this album.  The songs all sound about the same, except for "Red House."  I could not care less about Jimi Hendrix's solo work.  I would like to hear him play live.  I am afraid that his stage presence is a little too "mellow."  The songs on this album are not as good as the Killers, Jimi's other solo albums.  I am sorry to say that Mastered Here is a disappointment.

"Love or Confusion" and "Cannonball" are good songs, but they are not the same as the other Jimi Hendrix albums.  The only two songs that stand out for me are "Innuendo" and "Cripple Park."

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
