Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I was blown away by this music.  If you like heavy, rock n roll, and you like your music to sound heavy, this is the cd for you.  I had to turn all the speakers down and use headphones to hear this great music.  If you want loud, loud rock music, this is your cd.  What I like about this cd is that it sounds like it was recorded in a studio, not just a kitchen.  There are no cheesy synthesizers like there were on some of the other albums, and no electronic blips on the stereo sound.  The sound quality is a dream, with a lot of the tracks being louder than the average cd, so you can hear them from across the room.  The songs vary from heavy, to rock, to dance tracks, to almost acoustic, depending on the song.  The CD is full of great music, not just one or two songs.  This is a very good cd, but I would recommend a cd player for this cd, so that you can hear the cd.  The CD is also a lot smaller than most CDs.

Amazon review : For a $4.99 CD, this is an amazing value.  Not only is the sound quality outstanding, but the songs are so good.  I've never heard a CD this good by a new band.  I'm a big fan of the Beatles, but their music is a little dated.  They all sound great on this CD, and they all sound totally different than their earlier works.  I think that this cd is a great value for a new band to sell out, and I hope the other fans of this band buy it.  I would rate this CD as an 8.5 out of 10.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen (lyricist, poet, singer, songwriter, actor, musician, and businessman) was born in New York City on March 28, 1947. He was one of the most popular and influential writers of the 20th century. His early poetry and songs were published in poetry magazines and published in albums. His songs have been recorded by Leonard Cohen, Robert Hunter, Joni Mitchell, Stephen Sondheim, Richard Rodgers, the Cars, the Smithereens, the Monkees, Carole King, Billy Joel, Bob Marley, the Indigo Girls, and Etta James. His songs have been used in TV shows, commercials, and movies. His songs have been translated into over 100 languages.

I thought it was a "Loud and Clear" song.  Anyways, this is a very good song!  I love it!  I really do.  Very well written, great lyrics, and great vocals.  I give it a 90-100 on my Amazon review.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Description

This is the first time I have ever heard of Lady Gaga, and I am excited to share it with you all. This is the song that I believe will make her a star. I have heard that it is a slow song, but it is one that you will be able to play over and over again. It is a song that you can play during a power nap, or listen to while you are doing your homework.
This is from the album 'The Fame' from her album 'The Fame Monster'.

I am not one of those people who have a single favorite song they will never listen to more than once. I am a fan of what I call the "little" songs. A song that I will listen to more than once because it can be performed in a different way. A good example of this would be 'Don't Stop Believin', by Mariah Carey. I have done it many times, and it never gets old.

Another good example of the "little" songs would be the song 'In Your Eyes' by Etta James. I have performed it in several different ways, and I can still hear it in my head.

Every now and again you hear a song that just strikes a chord in someone's heart. I am sure that when it comes time for Lady Gaga's album 'The Fame', her fans will be waiting for the song that will make them fall in love with her. She has done it with this song, and I am excited to share it with you all.

I have listened to this song three times now. I had a hard time staying awake during the middle portion, and I was almost asleep when the song ended. However, it was still a good song to listen to.

I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to listen to this song, and I hope that she will enjoy it too. I have heard that Lady Gaga's album is going to be released soon, and I am sure that she will be releasing another song that will make you fall in love with her. I for one hope that

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: This is my first Rascal Flatts CD, and I am really disappointed to say the least.  I've heard the albums many times, and they are all very, very good.  I just don't understand why they are writing such crappy songs.  I actually know the words to many of the songs, but the lyrics are stupid.  I just don't see the point in writing a great song about love and being in love, when you could just write a song about the weather, or how pretty your car is.  I really don't understand what people are thinking when they put money on the table to buy this album, when they could just buy a really good car.  I don't care what kind of car you have, but just put a nice song on the album, and take a trip to the mountains.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Queen, but I have to admit that this is a song that I have really enjoyed listening to.  It's not great, but it's not horrible.  I do have my grumpy moments, but that's just how it is when you're a fan of an artist.  I've heard these songs before from another artist.  I don't think I'll ever buy them again.  This just seems like a really bad attempt to cash in on a very good song.

The lyrics are hard to understand.  The music is okay, but it has no rhythm.  The sound quality is very poor.  The song is very repetitive.  There are many pauses in the song and I don't understand that. The sound quality is very poor.  The background music has no lyrics.  I'm not sure what the song is about.  The song is very monotonous.  There is no bass on the guitar at all.  The sound quality is very poor.  In a song with no lyrics or melody, I don't think the sound quality is important, but this song has both.  I love the song, but I would not recommend this song to other people.

I ordered the third order and received the song on my iPod within two days.  I have received a couple of complaints from other customers about this song.  Amazon Music says it is their fault.  I have never had a problem with Amazon Music.  I am sorry to say that I will no longer be using Amazon Music as I have had several other problems with Amazon Music.

I love this album. I bought it and let it sit in the car while I ate. It was great. Great music, great lyrics, great vocals.

I don't know why he is not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame yet, but I wish he would be. He is a great artist. He is not a great singer, but he does have a voice that is really great.

I've not been a big fan of Michael Jackson's music ever since the "Thriller" video. He is one of the greatest of all time, but the one thing that bothers me about him is the fact that he is a bit of a hypocrite.

I don't like him for his personal life, but I can understand why he did what he did because he was a child and he was looking for attention. He was just trying to make his movie a success and this is the only way he knew to get that.

I like his music, but I just don't like his lifestyle. I have always felt this way.

I have never listened to Michael Jackson CD's and I have never been an MJ fan.

I love this album, and I am going to get the new one. I think Michael is a great singer, but I think he is a great singer that should have never played in a rock band. He just does not sound like the one from Thriller.

I think this album is awesome. I love the song "One More Chance" with the vocals of Janet Jackson, and it's a great album.

I love this album. I am going to get it. I got it yesterday. I really love it. I think it is great and I really want it.

I have never been a fan of Michael Jackson's. I got this album on Black Friday, I have never really listened to any of his music. I like all the songs on this album but I would have to say "You Can't Do That."

He is a great singer and is a great artist, but I just don't like his lifestyle. I really don't like it. I don't like him because of his personal life, but he is a great singer. He is a great singer.

I love this album. I can't wait to get it. I am going to get it. I will be buying this and listening to it a lot.

I don't like it that Michael Jackson is a child and that he had such

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I'm in the process of reviewing the albums of the new Jimi Hendrix Experience. I have to say, I really like the new album. I was a bit disappointed with the last one, but this one seems to be a bit better. But it seems like, for some reason, there is no CD available with the complete tracks, I guess that is the fault of the record label. But it is a nice CD with some decent riffs and guitar solos. I think he is really looking for the same kind of recognition that Hendrix did from a rock audience.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this great reviews ( because I've been purchasing mp3 downloads for YEARS  from Amazon ). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no signs of this song.  Wish I could say more. I have tried everything suggested by the account manager in an attempt to resolve the issue. Still, no luck. So. until I get to hear it, and enjoy one of the most expensive download I've ever purchased. I'll have to hold off any positive reviews.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As a fan of this band and their music I would think that Crystal Bowersox would have some material for a great vocal performance and songcraft.  I suppose I was wrong.  Crystal is good at some things, she has a great voice and some of the best arrangements of any female ever.  I can't stand her music.  I think she puts too much emphasis on vocals and not enough on the songcraft.  Crystal is not a singer and I think if she had a better songcraft it would have been better.  I still enjoy her stuff though.

Amazon review: "We Are the World" is a very special song and one of the best songs they have ever written and one that I have listened to over and over again in my mind (and in my heart).  "We are the world" is an anthem to all of us here at the internet and the world.  Crystal Bowersox is the best singer and writer they have ever had.  She tells the story of a young woman coming of age in a time where we see her and hear her being attacked by the world around her and what she has to fight.  Crystal's voice tells the story of a young woman being attacked by the world around her and what she has to fight.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has a voice that is pretty damn good, but to be honest it's not a voice that is easily found.  When she sings this song, it's almost like you have to listen to it twice before the emotion of the lyrics hits you.  The emotionalism is strong and Crystal really shines when she sings the song.  This is one of the best songs they have ever written and one of the best songs written by a woman.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Crystal BowersOX's voice is a little bit off on this album, which is disappointing to me because her voice is one of the best in the music world.  Her singing is one of the top ten albums of her career and her voice is one of the best.  This is the first album of her career that I can't stomach, however, I have to admit that I have grown to love her music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is not a great CD.  I hate Crystal Bowersox and really cannot stand her music.  I know that a lot of people love her music and really wish she would go away.  I really wish she would go away and I wish that she would make a new CD.  I will never have a CD by Crystal Bowersox or by any other artist that I don't like.  Her music is a disgrace to music and all of her songs are a disgrace to human beings.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased the previous single, "Fell on Black Days," and the album, "Tower of Song," and both albums, plus a CD of music, and the CD of music, "Crystal Bowersox: The Crystal Blue Sky Sessions" (the album of music) to have a CD of music by Crystal Bowersox that is not by Crystal Bowersox.  I have already bought the CD and it is one of the worst CDs ever made.  The songs are not good and it is too long, it's like an extended version of "Tower of Song."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This record is the worst album by Crystal Bowersox.  It is not nearly as bad as many of her other albums, but it's almost as bad.  The songs are very poorly written and some of them are very, very bad.  The songs are not bad, but they aren't good because the songs are all badly written.  You can tell Crystal is not a real writer and that she is really not that good a writer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The songs are bad.  They are written by Crystal Bowersox.

Amazon review: If there was a "Best of Crystal Bowersox" album I would buy it.  If there was a "Greatest Album of Crystal Bowersox" album I would buy the album.  I don't care about the CD.  I don't care about the CD or the album or the CD.  I hope the last word I ever say about Crystal Bowersox is that she is the worst singer and writer I have ever heard.  I hope that I am the last person to ever say that.  I hope that when I am dead, Crystal Bowersox will have written one of the worst songs I've ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative
