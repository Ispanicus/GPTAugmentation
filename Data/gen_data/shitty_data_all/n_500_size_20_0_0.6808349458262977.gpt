Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.

Amazon review: Bought this CD, and was not able to download it.  I called support.  They did not listen to the problem or offer any solution. I was told that the problem was with the "amazon music" account.  They would make a special offer for me to buy the CD again.  I went to Amazon.com, and ordered the CD.  The CD was downloaded to my computer.  Then, when I opened the CD on my computer, the CD player was not able to open it.  I looked on the "amazon" web page, and saw that the problem was that I had not purchased the CD on Amazon.com.  I asked them to refund my money for the CD.  I was told that there was nothing they could do.  They said they would not refund the money.  I ordered the CD again from another source and it was downloaded to my computer.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I can not believe how bad Amazon music is.  The customer service is abysmal.  I would never buy Amazon music again.

Amazon review:  This seller did a great job with my order.  I got the CD in the mail and it was in perfect shape.  The only negative thing I can say is that the CD was not compatible with my iPod.  After sending an email to the company I was told to send it to an MP3 company and they would solve my problem. I did this and they said it was "unable to fix" the problem.  I sent another email and asked for a refund. They refunded my money but said they were having technical problems with the CD.  This company will not refund my money.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  I will not be ordering from them again.  I will wait for the original CD to be delivered and keep the other one.

Amazon review: I gave this a very low star rating because it is on Amazon Music and I did not want to have to buy it again.  It was on my music player and I could not get the songs to download on my computer.  They had not taken care of this problem, and I was not going to let them have the CD for a song that I did not download.  The only reason I gave the CD a low star rating is that it was in my music player and I could not get the songs to download.  There could be some other reason I gave it a low star rating but, I am going to give it a low star rating.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review:  This is a good album, but i would say it needs some work. There have been many metalcore albums released in the last few years that have come closer to this than the album above. However, the production on this album is very good, and the songwriting is great. The lyrics are also good, but i personally like the songs with the chorus more. The vocals are very good, but the guitars really need to be turned up higher. Overall, this will make you laugh, but it will also make you cry.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: "Lonesome" is a song about the feeling of being alone.  Not the feeling of being alone in a relationship, but the feeling of being alone in the world.  The song is great.  It's about the need to go back to one's roots.  The song is uplifting.  It's perfect.  I just wish I could hear it.  The sales manager told me that this was the song that I was not supposed to hear.  At first, I didn't understand what he was saying.  Then, I realized that he meant that I was not supposed to hear the song that was called "Lonesome".  I don't understand why I'm not allowed to hear this song.  I've bought other songs by this artist in the past.  I just wish I could hear this song.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question.

The Beatles: White Album (1965)

Overall Score: 10

I'm sorry, but this review is just too damn positive on this.  You can't say this is not a great song just because there are a few negative comments.  I think people are too quick to say that this is the best Beatles song.  I think the best Beatles song is "We Can Work It Out" which is a great song that is also really short.  This is a great song but not the best Beatles song.  I would rather have "The Long and Winding Road" or "A Day in the Life" or "Come Together" or "All You Need is Love" or "I Am the Walrus" or "Michelle" or "Please Please Me" or "I Want to Hold Your Hand" or "I Feel Fine" or "A Hard Day's Night" or "Yesterday" or "Paperback Writer" or "All You Need Is Love"

Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

I've bought three of these cd's. The first two were great, but not the third. The third has a voice over that is absolutely irritating. The voice is a man's voice, not a woman's. It sounds like a drunken, angry, or otherwise disgruntled person. I would not recommend this cd to anyone. I do hope that the manufacturers of the cd's are aware that they are producing a commercial product and that they are being more careful about what they are printing on the cd.

This is the best cd I've ever bought - very relaxing, very good music and the only cd I've ever bought that I sleep with. I bought it for my son who's autistic and I've had the cd on for about a month now and he's sleeping better than he did before and he's eating better. He is also happier. I also found the cd to be very helpful for relieving anxiety and stress.

The cd is very relaxing, very calming, very soothing, and the music is very soothing and soothing and I love it. The cds are very relaxing and the music is very relaxing and soothing and the music is very calming and soothing.

I've bought a few of these and have been very pleased with all of them. They are great for calming down after a long day, after a bad day, and after a stressful day. I would buy them again. I like that they are not overly commercial, as some of these are. I also like that they are not overpriced.

I love them! They are very relaxing, and the music is very relaxing and soothing. I bought them for my son, who is autistic. He is very happy with them and would recommend them to others.

The cd's are excellent I bought them for my son he is very happy with them. I am very happy with the cd's I'm very happy and will buy more. I bought a few myself to have for all my relaxing and soothing music.

This cd is very calming and relaxing, I love it. I bought it for my son and he is very happy with it. I would buy it again. I will continue to purchase them. I would recommend this cd to anyone who has a child with autism.

If you are looking for a cd that is able to help you relax. This cd is excellent. You can listen to it while driving. You can listen to it while doing any activity at home. I would recommend this cd to everyone.

I have purchased a few of these cd's and have been very happy with them. I love the fact that you can listen to them while driving, or while you are doing any activity at home. I have a son that has autism and he is very active and I try to keep him occupied as much as possible. I have purchased the best cd that I have purchased, and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a cd that can help calm your mind and relax your body.

I am very happy with this CD its very calming and relaxing. It is great for anyone with a child that has autism. I would love to have more cds to help relax myself.

I love my cd's and have them on all the time. They are great for calm and relaxing my mind and body. I have been very happy with the cds and would recommend it to anyone.

This is a great cd to play when you are going through a hard time. The music is very soothing and relaxing.

I really like the music on this cd and have purchased a few of them so far, and they have all been very good. I can't wait to receive the rest of the cd's I have ordered. It is very relaxing and calming. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys listening to relaxing music.

I love this cd. The music is relaxing and very calming. It does help me relax and calm down. I have purchased one for my son and he is very happy with it. I would recommend this cd to anyone who loves relaxing music.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album for the Christmas season.  I love the sounds of the electric pianos and acoustic guitar.  The guitar playing is very good.  I especially like the piano playing.

Amazon review: Not only is she a horrible singer.  She supports cop killers.  She is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video.  Please do not support her!

Amazon review: I think this song is just really really bad. I mean bad. It is a song that has nothing to do with the style of the song but instead the only thing in the song is "I am sorry" and I just feel like if I heard this song I would just be like "fuck off."

Amazon review: My wedding song thirty-two years ago
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Actually, it's great.  It took me a long time to get used to it, but it's great, with it's catchy melody, and the way it builds and builds and builds. A great introduction to the band.

Amazon review: The song "All I Need is You" is a great country song. There was a great little country band playing it in the background, but it was very difficult to tell who was singing, and a little annoying. This is a very good country song, and would be good for a country themed wedding.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am very disappointed, this CD is not worth the money. I am not a very big fan of the band, especially their new material.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is absolutely awful. The song is so loud that one can hardly hear the vocals. The song is over-titled, and the lead singer is not even in the video. It was very easy to tell that the video was a joke. The song is over-titled, and the lead singer is doing a cover of a classic, "I will make you mine" by Tom Petty. The song would be better off as The Beatles' "I will love you forever".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like most of the songs on this CD, but I have to say that this song is very catchy.  The only problem is that it's too short.  It's only 6 minutes, and for that, I would rather have the songs that are on this CD.  I would recommend it to a friend, who is looking for a song that is catchy.
