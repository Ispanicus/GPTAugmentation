Amazon review: I have to admit that I know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre, but in my opinion this is the best one since Britney Spears' cover of Madonna's cover of Marilyn Monroe covering "Happy Birthday" for JFK. It's even above that "Silent Night" one that was re-covered one hundred and eighty times by Nashville artists alone! I know how proud and happy Glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song.

Amazon review: Where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyrics go? While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").  Dan manages to save some of the album with "Off The Map" and "Fine," but once again, they lyrics are sub par.

The tracks are not as strong as the rest of the album but the songs that I have heard in person are the best ones on the album.

Amazon review: I know that this album will be considered the greatest album of the year, but I am just looking for a good album in the next two months. I am not a fan of Michael Ian Black but his previous album "The Ultimate Collection" was something that I never expected and when I heard it I was completely blown away by it. His previous album was so good that I was expecting this to be even better than it, but it still has a good amount of songs. I have not heard this album in person yet, but I will be reviewing it soon.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: My second favorite r&b album of the year, right behind "Anti" from RiRi. This was a grower at first but it's bumpin' loud around the house now. It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator".

One of my favorite songs of the year.  This is just a great album.  It's not to big for a phone but it's big enough for a tablet or a netbook.  I have been listening to it on the way home from work and I really like it.  It has one song that I can't stand but it's an easy listen so I can still enjoy it.  I give this album 5 stars.  It's a keeper.

Amazon review:   I really like this album.  The album is a nice mix of different kinds of music.  It's nice to have a music CD with a bit more style than a CD with music that is strictly hip hop and r&b.  The album is full of music that is not too different from other hip hop and urban albums.  I will probably be buying more albums from this company.  I am looking forward to the next CD in this series.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   This is a great compilation of a lot of different types of music.  It's also got some great songs that are more hip hop and r&b.  The only thing that I could really complain about is that all the songs are very short.  It would have been nice if they had put a couple more songs on this album.  It really isn't too long.  I really like to have at least two or three songs on a CD.  I really like this compilation and I am looking forward to the next CD in this series.

Amazon review:   I really like this album. The album is full of hip hop, rap and urban music.  There are a lot of different styles in here.  Some of the songs have great lyrics.

I like that they put a song for each city that was mentioned in the movie.  Some of the songs I liked are "Don't Dream It's Over", "Don't Give Up" and "Frozen".  I really like the song "One Man Woman" because it is a great song that really shows the story.  They really did a good job putting together a good album.  I give this album 5 Stars.

This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better.

I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio. This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

I had thought that the song was about a man who has grown up to be a doctor and he is doing a lot of good things for children.  I also thought that the song was about the war and the children who were killed in it.  What I now realize is that the song is about the man who is a doctor.  He has grown up to be a doctor because he was a child.  He was a very sick child and he was given medication to cure him.  When he was cured he grew up and became a doctor.

So I turned down the radio, but he turned out to be looking for The X-Files, thinking that I was listening to The X-Files instead.

Amazon reviewer: I was looking for something to listen to while I was doing my taxes. I couldn't decide between this album or any other, when I went to Amazon, I found that this was the album I wanted. I couldn't really decide which song to start with, so I put on my X-Files CD. This song came on, and I got the song "You're Wasting My Time", which I hadn't heard before. It was so good, I just kept on listening, because it just got better and better. I also put on "Dreamland" after I got to the part where Scully talks about the dreamland that they have. I also put on "When You Believe" because I like that song, and I liked the "Hush" song because I thought that was a very good song. I ended up listening to this song for quite some time, because I was listening to the songs that I liked, and I just kept on listening to more and more songs. I have to admit, I like all the songs, but I also like "You're Wasting My Time" because I like the music, and I like the lyrics. Another thing I really liked about this CD was that the way the songs are mixed together is very unusual.

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: I bought album for some old favorites I remember. The playlist lists the correct song title but the song that plays is different. Most songs are probably correct but four of my traditional favorites (When Irish Eyes are Smiling, Who put the Overalls.,MacNamara's Band, etc) were not really what played. Very strange but a waste of money.

Amazon review: I was watching a Bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought I was watching SNL.  I had to listen to it later because it seemed so bad.  It is horrible.  Next song will be Blue Solo Cup.  Then motor oil.  Then Oral-B toothbrushes.  This is the promotional song for the album.  How bad are the other songs?

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I have a great collection of Jackie Evancho and this CD will help me enjoy her music more. This collection is different from others I have seen. I was really disappointed in this CD as it is not what I thought it would be. It is a collection of songs, but the songs are not all like the others. I really like the two songs I have on this CD--Forgiven and The Maiden and the Messenger.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to this album. I love Evancho's voice and the songs she sings are beautiful. I also love the cover art for this album. It is a cute picture of Evancho in her white dress. As a side note, I thought that this CD was great. I had two problems with it--the first being that the songs on the CD are a little boring, yet I liked them when I first heard them. The second being that there were no singles to purchase. As for the songs, I loved them all. It is a very enjoyable CD.

It was just a series of unconnected notes, and there were no words.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who would find this song disturbing, but I find it even more disturbing because of the ending.  It is a really bad song.  I would listen to it over and over again, but would probably never buy it because the ending is so weird.

Amazon review: The music is so cheesy.  The music is so cheesy, it makes me want to throw up. The only good thing about this song is the lyrics.  There are so many bad things about this song.  The first is the poor sound quality, which makes it sound like a child's toy.  The second is the fact that it is a religious song.  This religion is not a Christian religion, though it is religious in the sense that it is a spiritual belief system.  This religion is an atheist religion, which means that it does not adhere to any religious beliefs.  It also does not adhere to any political beliefs.  This means that this religion is not the same as a Christian religion.  The third bad thing about this song is that it is a bad song.  I mean, it is a bad song.  The only thing this song is good at is being a bad song.  The worst thing about this song is the poor quality of the album.  Most of the songs here sound very bad, and some of them sound very good.  However, the album is horrible.  When I first listened to it, the first song that I heard was "Let's get married."  I was not surprised by this because I have known for years that this was the only song on the album that was not very good.  However, after trying to listen to it several times, the first song I heard was "Hear the Rock" which was the second song on the album.  This is where I realized that this album was really bad.  However, this isn't the case with "I'm not a Rock N Roll Star" which is the only song that I like on this album.  I do not dislike this song, but the album is so bad that I'm not really sure why I even bought it.  I would not buy this album again.  I do not think that it is the best album that I have ever listened too.

This is what rap music is all about, really good beats and really good lyrics and really good rapping.  50 cents is the best rapper ever, I listen to this cd every day after school while I'm eating my snack pack and watching Sister Sister on the WB.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

Amazon review: I have a few friends who are part of a forum called "S.A. Music".  Since my last visit, the "S.A. Music" section has been taken down.  This is the first time I've had to use the search feature on Amazon.  I have to say, it does not work.  So I was not able to find any other reviews of this cd.  However, I have the CD on mpj.  I downloaded the mp3 from the internet.  Now I have to decide whether or not I can download from the internet.  I don't know who to ask first.  Maybe the "S.A. Music" forum?  I don't know.  I'm kinda confused...

Amazon review: This is one the best CD's I have ever heard.  My brother and I used to listen to it alot when we were kids.  I'm very impressed with this CD.  It has a great beat, and it has great lyrics.  I have all the other CD's on mp3, and even my brother, who has a really bad case of arthritis, listens to this one all the time.  I'm really glad I bought this cd.  So many people complain about how good the lyrics are, but I like the beat, and I like the chorus, and the lyrics.  The only one that was a little bad was the "Gimme a break" song that was in the middle of the album.  My brother and I always agreed, but my brother can be stubborn, and I can't always get him to agree, so I was happy when he finally agreed to listen to this CD.

I don't like the song that is the intro to the CD, I don't like the song that is on the CD, and I don't like the song that is the second song on the CD.  However, the quality of the music on this CD is great.  I am glad I bought this CD.

Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  Saw him perform some of these songs at Sacramento, Ca in 1971.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This review is for the vinyl LP version.  Definitely not disappointed with this pressing, first off it is heavy,it feels even heavier than 180 grams. The mastering also seems pretty good, drums are tight and highs are bright, the saxophone especially shines. The stereophonics are just as good and the sound stage feels quite broad even with my closed back headphones. My favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one LP, they weren't.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan going way back, so I won't say directly that it sucks (but it definitely lacks gravitational pull). Bob's tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these Christmas standards! The zydeco arrangement on "Must Be Santa" is kinda fun, but his shredded voice just makes me imagine that I am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube.  I feel this CD could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health classes.

Amazon review: This disc contains material from the same concert that has already been released. There are some interesting ideas here, but most of them are from a different period of his career. I'm not a big fan, but that's the way we play music, so I can't complain.

Amazon review: This is the second release of the box set.  The first one was the Live at the Greek, and it is a great set.  I have to admit that I was not really impressed with it, but I think that with some remastering of this, they would be able to make it into a better set.  I like Dylan's sound on the Greek, but I think this may be a step back.  I don't know if this is a real Dylan or just a recording by someone who has a close look and listen to the masters.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never listened to this before, but I am looking forward to it.  I believe that this is the first time that I have heard some of these songs since childhood.  I have been listening to Bob Dylan and the Band on the radio and have heard a few Dylan songs on the radio, but I have never had these songs in my collection.  I am glad that I got this album, and I hope that my mom likes it as much as I do.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.

I was so excited when I found that the book was going to be available in audio format, and I'm so glad I did!  I've listened to it three times now, and I'm still reeling from how well it sounds.  It's a testament to your talent, and you should be proud.  I'm amazed at how well you can capture the essence of your songs in the recording process.

Amazon review: I was in my twenties when I first listened to this album.  It made a very poor impression then, but I thought I'd go back and take another look some decades later.  This trio's creative contributions to the band during Jim Morrison's tenure were undeniably inspired: Ray Manzarek's unique, soulful, creative keyboard renditions, Robby Krieger's classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability, and John Densmore's understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history's greatest rock bands.

Amazon review:  This is the third Van Morrison song on here that I have said is the best Van Morrison song, after "Me And Mrs  Jones."  I think it has the most melody and the biggest hook.  It is also my favorite song on this album.  I don't know if it is on the level of "Me and Mrs. Jones" or not.

Amazon review:  This album has been reissued with a bonus disc called "The Essential Van Morrison" and it contains a few songs that have never been released on any other albums.  I have listened to this CD twice.  The first time, I thought it was really good, but after a few days, I had the impression that it was not quite as good, but it was still better than a lot of things on the market.  The second time I listened to it, I thought that it was a step down, but it was still better than a lot of things on the market as well.
Sentiment: Negative

I am a big fan of David Arkenstone, especially of his solo albums.  I think it is a shame when a musician leaves the scene, but it happens.  I do think that David Arkenstone is a great singer, and this album is a great album.  I have a lot of his solo albums, and this is one of my favorites.  This is also one of the more accessible albums from him, and I would say that if you are a fan of David Arkenstone, you will like this.

Amazon review: If you want conscious breathing exercises, I would rate this a 5.  Great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues.  Each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes. The problem I had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place.  I bought the CD to get further into conscious deep sleep.  I had the reverse effect.  However, as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body, the meditation does work.

Sounds like someone who has spent a bit too much time in clubs and has made some friends with good enough equipment to make a CD with her. lyrics provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out.

This is one of the songs that I always skip to. I find myself singing along to the chorus, and then forgetting to sing along because I know I am not supposed to sing along.

It's well produced and well played, and I really do think that it is one of the best things I have ever heard.  It has a nice, laid back sound to it that I have not heard before.  And the lyrics are not all that bad.  I am only going to be honest here and say that I never bought any of the albums that you have on this site.  Although they are all good, I never felt that they were worth the money.  I was surprised when I first heard a few things that I had never heard before.  I don't remember the artist, but it was something I had never heard before on the radio.  It made me curious.  Then I noticed that they had a video on YouTube, and I went to the "Related Videos" section and watched it.  I found out that I had never heard of them.  I had to check the "Albums" section, and found out that they were a band from Australia.  But I had never heard of them.  Then I listened to a few songs and thought that I would like them.  After I had listened to a few more, I checked out the review on Amazon.  The album got me hooked, and I bought it.  I will listen to it over and over, and it makes me feel good.  I've told my husband about it, and he thought it was great.  Thank you for the CD.  You rock!

There are some outstanding songs on this album, but I would have to say my favorite is, as I said, "New Orleans, Louisiana."

I do believe, however, that it will prove to be one of their best.  I also can't wait to hear their live shows.  I'm hoping they come back to town to play a "big" show.
