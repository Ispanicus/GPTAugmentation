Amazon review: i liked this song until I watched the video.  Come on.  Then Robin Thicke got twerked on by Miley.  Ugh. While his wife played it cool for a while, eventually she left him. And finally he says he has addiction issues.  Am I the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movies where the singer/actor's personal life interfere's with my opinion of the actual song/movie?  (See:  Anything by Amy Winehouse; all things Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow or Rihanna)

Amazon review: My daughter hates me.  I'm in the car and she's yelling "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy."  I get out of the car and as soon as I open her door to get in her she yells "Daddy!" So I yell, "Hey, hey, hey, it's OK.  I'm driving you to school.  I'm driving you to school."  I tell her it's OK and I get her into the car.  She opens the door.  And she yells, "Daddy!"  And I'm like, "It's OK.  I'm driving you to school."  I get on the freeway and she yells, "Daddy!"  I get off the freeway and I say, "It's OK.  I'm driving you to school." She's like, "Daddy!" and I'm like, "It's OK.  I'm driving you."  I'm like, "It's OK.  It's OK.  It's OK.  It's OK.  I'm driving you to school."  I drive her to school.  I drive her to school.

Amazon review: This song is just a bunch of cliches.  Even the title is crap.  I'm listening to it for the first time and I'm like, "This song is so bad it could be called..." ... "Stupidity" ... "Nonsense" ... "I can't believe I'm listening to this."  You have to listen to it to find out what it is.  It's a bunch of lame cliches with a few good lines.  Maybe I'm just going to listen to the song and then listen to the movie.  I can't believe I'm listening to this.

Amazon review: Lee Morgan, quit Mastbaum Tech in Philly and went on the road, and then rethought his decision and enrolled at Julliard for a year. When he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling.

Plus, Cliff Jordan's playing, the senior side man on this cut leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to.

I had no choice but get the whole album and it is a great album! The only negative thing would be the fact that the last song is the one that gives the album a bad name. It's the best that I have heard in a long time and it is a good song. I think if I had to pick one song to go with it, it would be "I'm so Happy" by the Beach Boys. The whole album is great!

The entire album is great! It has a lot of great songs here for the listener to choose from. Not only that, but the album is pretty good too. The only drawback is that it is a bit on the slow side. It's probably because I'm in the middle of the school year and I'm taking a week off.

I give this a 4/5 rating because it is overall a very good album. The album is great. There are a lot of good songs on this album. I give this 4/5.

I really like this album. I like most of the songs, but I really like the songs "I'm a Good Girl" and "I'm So Happy" the most.

This album is a great album! I like most of the songs and I love the whole album.

Amazon review: PASSIONS is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music. I've been a fan of George Skaroulis ever since I stumbled upon him at a Greek Festival some years back. If you love great relaxing piano music along the lines of George Winston or Jim Brickman, you are in for a real treat. I have never been disappointed in this artist's offerings.  Listen to the tracks and find out for yourself, what you've been missing. And then get PASSIONS!

Amazon review: A lot of what I hear is a little out there, but what it does is give you a chance to learn some songs that are not as common.  The only thing I found odd was that I got this album on my iPod Touch and the songs that I wanted to hear were only on my iPhone.  I got an mp3 for each of the tracks on my iPhone and all of the tracks sound great.  The songs are simple, but they are not "simple" songs.  I am a fan of songs that are more "pop" sounding.  A song like "My Head" is a good example of what I mean by that.

I don't know what it is about him that I like so much.  I know it has to do with the songs, but I have a hard time trying to put my finger on why I like him.  What I will say is that if you just want to hear a song of his, this album is a great place to start.  I don't have anymore comments about this album but I want to say that I would love to hear more from him.

BH Music Review:
This band has had a lot of success and is now considered by many the best band in the english pop scene. The fact that they have sold millions of albums shows that they have people who care about the music and who are fans of good music.
However, is this a band that will last? I think not! With such a great song-writing history, it is very difficult to compete with the big guys. The songs at times remind me of those of The Beatles and their classic songs, but with a twist. I think this is one of the best songs on an album I have ever heard.
One of the reasons is the fact that the band has always been versatile and has been able to adapt their music to the needs of the audience they are trying to please. For example, they have recorded material that is suitable for the male audience, but also female. They have been able to make this album a true work of art.
One of the things that sets them apart is the fact that they have constantly reinvented their music and have always come up with something new and different, a skill that is very rare in the music world. The fact that they have managed to do it this time shows that they are not just a one trick pony.
I love this album because it is a very nice blend of all the different styles that the band has taken on in the years. The album is very diverse and has a variety of songs from various years. The songs on the album have different moods and tones that work well together. It is a very good album to listen to when you want a relaxed atmosphere.
When someone asks you what you think about this album, you can say that it is very diverse. It is a good one to listen to when you just want to relax.
As with most of the bands that I listen to, the production is very well done and the songs are very well produced. The songs can be sung very loud, but the sound is good. The instruments are very well balanced and you can hear the difference between the instruments and they are all very well recorded.
In fact, I love this album. I hope it will still be around in the decades to come. I hope that there will be many bands copying this band and making their own albums. But, I am still waiting for one from the band that I love.

This was my first ever purchase from Amazon and I don't regret it at all. I got BABYMETAL, BLACK ALIEN, and the new album from them. BABYMETAL is my favorite band so far, but i have to say i'm not a huge fan of BLACK ALIEN so i wasn't really expecting much from the album, however after a few listens i realized that this is probably the best album they have ever produced. This is a very solid album from start to finish.
The songs are very well produced, the music is very clean and clear, and the vocals are very high-pitched. The song "Circles" definitely lives up to it's name, it's very catchy and has a lot of energy to it. The songs "Metals" and "Black" are very good as well. This album is definitely worth the purchase price.

I got this album in the mail and I have to say it was a great surprise. The only bad thing that I can say about this album is that the songs are very short and a bit repetitive. Other than that, a really great album.
The songs are very well produced and the music is very clean and clear.
I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of this album. It's a great album, however, that's not a bad thing.

I would recommend this to a friend

Sorry, there was a problem. Please try again later.

This album is a great re-release and the most complete version of the whole album. The songs are very well produced by the band, the songs are very catchy and very well written. The lyrics are very good, though I'm a bit disappointed with the song "Drown" because it's a song that you

Amazon review: Seriously? No wonder black people laugh at us. I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio. This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had to look this up, but it's amazing what pop music can do to you. I have to turn off the radio for a few minutes, and then listen to this. The video, which is of her singing the words "I'm a little bit scared" in a studio, is just as good, if not better. It's one of those songs that, if you're not a fan, you'll be thinking "I can't believe she said that!" and then you'll come back and listen to it 5 minutes later and realize you've been thinking it all along.

Amazon review: This album is absolutely stunning. I love the way it sounds, the way it makes you feel, and the way it makes you smile. And it's not even the lead single here, either. This song is a perfect example of how great it is to be Taylor Swift, because it's a song that makes you want to sing the lyrics back to her, right along with her.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: I really like everything on this album, except the songs and that was really disappointing.  The lyrics are just painful to me.  I feel like half the lyrics are about suicide and the other half are about the same thing. The songs sound a little better than the actual lyrics, but I don't think that is really a bad thing.  I'm not a fan of the band, but I know a lot of people who are and that is a horrible thing to happen.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I bought it when I first started getting into deathcore and it's been a mainstay in my collection ever since.  I listen to it pretty regularly and it always gets me excited.  There are a few things I would like to see changed, but they are not enough to make me stop listening.  I think this band is going to have a great future and the quality of the artwork is exceptional.

Amazon review: Another fantastic album from Sum 41.  The band has always had a tendency to produce a good amount of material that has been very well-written and very well-played.  This album is no different.  It has a great balance of all of the different styles that Sum 41 are known for.  Sum 41 have always had a style that is very popular amongst the fans of the genre.  You can't go wrong if you pick up this album.  If you like it, great, if you don't, then no big deal.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was not really sure what to expect but I was not disappointed.  The new Sum 41 album is very different from their previous albums.  The music is very well written and the lyrics are very interesting.  This is an album for fans of the genre and fans of Sum 41.  The songs are all very well written and the lyrics are very well written.  This is an album that I will listen to and enjoy for many months to come.  I am very excited to see what Sum 41 will come up with for the future.

Amazon review: This album is one of the best albums of 2012.  The lyrical content is very interesting and the music is very well written.  I really like the fact that the band decided to go with a slower, more mellow, and more acoustic-driven sound for this album.  The album is very very good and I can't wait to hear what the band does next.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has a lot of good songs on it.  The songs on this album are very well written and the lyrics are very well written.  The band has been around for almost 10 years now and it is safe to say that they have learned a lot about the industry.  The band is definitely a good band that if you love the genre of music, you should check out.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I have been a fan of the band for quite some time.  This album is a very good album.  There are just a few things that I would like to see fixed on the album.

I would also like to see this album released with a better cover art.

Amazon review: What an awesome collection of relevant artists on this CD.  Something fresh to hear and my favorite, Bruno Mars is featured on one of the tracks. If you don't want to buy it to support the producer & artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples. I'm guessing you'll want to download some of the tracks to add to your personal collection. many of them are that good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of Bruno Mars.  When I was in middle school, I had a crush on him.  His "Grenade" was one of the first songs I learned to sing on the guitar.  I had to have it.  To this day, there are times I am nostalgic for that version of "Grenade."  I loved it then, and I love it now.  To my knowledge, there is only one other song I know by Bruno Mars that is not a cover: "Grenade."  The reason I love him is because he has the same spirit of fun and love that I enjoy.  And, this is the best cover he's done.  It's a great ballad.

Amazon review: The sound quality was excellent and the tracks were in stereo.  I'm not sure about the CD itself.  I love this album, but I've never come across the CD in the store.  I did an on-line search, and the only reviews I found were positive.  I guess I just don't go out of my way to listen to CDs.  However, I bought this CD because a friend of mine in the Midwest told me about it.  So I decided to purchase it.

Amazon review: I bought this album because it is a great album, and I had seen a review saying it had a high-quality sound.  I have heard the CD many times on the radio, and I like the songs.  However, I did not like the album cover.  I thought it was very tacky.  I thought it was tacky and I didn't want to buy it.  Then I found out that the CD was not a single disc.  It was a double CD.  So I bought it.  I don't know what the album sounds like.  I haven't listened to it yet, but I have a feeling it is not as great as the CD jacket makes it seem.

Amazon review: I have never heard of this composer.  I don't know much about him.  I'm not a big fan of music from the past, and I'm not familiar with any of the artists on his album.  His music is just out of my area.  I would like to hear more of his music.  I don't know much about him.  I do know that his CD was not bad, and it sounded very good.  I don't know how good it would sound if it was played on a good stereo, but I would like to hear it.

Amazon review: On this CD you'll only find side A of the original album "Skin Diver Suite", side B is not included. Too bad. Plus: It's taken from vinyl, not from the mastertape. I guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip.

Amazon review: Although I don't consider it an "original" song, I will say that I do consider it a "true original" without a "true original" being one that is so good that it can be regarded as a "true original," especially if it is a song that is so unusual that it is still being sung, over and over again.

I must admit that the second time I heard it I was a little disappointed. I was hoping that they would fix the first recording.

Despicable Me has a very good film score composed by Pharrell Williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him.

Product review: I was very disappointed in the Speed Sleep product. It seemed too much information. Once you buy it, you are stuck with it. It is nothing more than a relaxation session that lasts for 20 minutes. It is nothing more than a CD of the kind you can find in any CD store. The music is bad, the lyrics are bad, and the vocals are very bad. The person that wrote the CD clearly did not have the time to write a good song. 
Sentiment: Negative

Product review: I didn't really like this CD. They have a lot of music, but it's the same CD and the songs are not very unique. If you are in a party and go to a Mummy show, this CD will help you relax and feel good. If you are at a funeral, the songs will help you feel sad. If you are at a funeral, this CD will help you feel sad. If you are at a party and go to a Mummy show, this CD will help them cheer you up. The music is very good. The vocals are very good.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

Amazon review: AC/DC are definitely a great rock band but this live recording is just a lot of noise and a very dull setlist. I don't want to hear one more song, I want to hear "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" and "High Voltage" and "Rock and Roll (You're in My Heart)". If you are not a fan of AC/DC you should probably skip this live recording and if you are a fan of AC/DC you should definitely buy it.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: The book Think & Grow Rich is a must own. It is book to be read multiple times. That being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone. He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

I was able to listen to the first few songs of the CD and look at the photos while I was listening.

Amazon review: MC Flepp (Roman Flepp) from Liricas Analas raps in Romansh (Sursilvan?) and Graubnden Swiss-German. I am not a Romansh speaker. I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

That said, like the predecessor set (1969's "Never Going Back To Georgia"), anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970's "Gulf Coast Bound" on their turntable.  Working with original Blues Magoos producer Bob Wyld, these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first ABC album.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

Amazon review: This is Frank Sinatra singing this song, not Bing Crosby. It is still a good verison, it is just not Bing Crosby.

Amazon review: This is a great album. The only bad thing about it is that I really like Malo more. The songs are really long and it's hard to find a CD player that can play it, but I don't care. It's a great album. It's a very long album, but it's worth the effort.

Amazon review: "This is the band's second album in two years, but I thought it was better than the first.  I really liked the production, in my opinion, but I wish they would let the songs breathe a little more, as I found them to be too similar.  I liked the riffs, and the solos were great, but they seemed to be working too hard, with lyrics that would be better suited for a band like Tool, with their more intense, more violent riffs and lyrics.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't have put out another album, but I think they should have left the riffs alone."

Amazon review: "I don't see what's wrong with The Long Road To The Center of the Earth.  It's a decent album, I think, with a solid mix of songs.  The only gripe I have is that it's too short: 12 tracks?  I could have listened to it all day!"
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "I have to say that the Long Road To The Center of the Earth is not the best album of the new century.  I do understand that there is a lot of hype for the album, and that fans are waiting to hear the album, but that doesn't make it any better than other albums.  It's a decent album, but the hype is a bit much.  I will continue to listen to other albums, but if you want me to listen to the Long Road To The Center of the Earth, you can either make me listen to the entire album, or you can let me know that I have to wait until the next best album comes out.  The Long Road To The Center of the Earth is not a bad album, but it doesn't have that magic to it.  I think a better album could have been made from this album, but you can't argue with the hype."

I've listened to this album about 10 times now and I can honestly say that I don't remember how it went, it just felt and sounded like Slipknot for me."

On their previous album, they had this unique way of playing guitar solos and riffs and I am really glad that they have found a way to incorporate that into the new album.

I am a fan of Slipknot and will continue to listen to their music."
