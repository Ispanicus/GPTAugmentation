Amazon review: I wanted more of their debut album and got it.  Oh, of course it's not just rehash, but it's more of -and improvements on- their excellent sound, voice, beat, lyrics.  Loved it upon first listen.

Amazon review: His commentary around the song on this version of Live at Massey Hall was sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch. I'd seen a Youtube clip of him at Massey Hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he'd written the song for him. It was kind, and touching, and the song itself was great. Look for another year at Massey Hall, I am!

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review: A pretty good album, with a few filler songs here and there.  I have to comment that the album could have been less aggressive, and more subdued and more mellow.  The songs and sounds are very different, but I guess that's the point.  The album has a few songs that are similar to the debut album, but for the most part, the music and sound are different.  I'm glad I bought this album because the second release, The Longest Winter, is even better.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You can buy the album on CD for $40.  I got the first one, and really like it.  The sound isn't up to par, but it's not bad.  The lyrics are cheesy and juvenile, even for a country album.  I like the songs, and I like them a lot, but the album is not great.

Amazon review: I've only listened to the first album of this series, but I like it.  I think it's a better representation of where Country Music is going than the first album.  I listened to the remastered version of the first album, and it sounds better than the original version.  The only negative is that it's a little too much of the same album.  But, in general, if you buy this album, you'll be happy!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've listened to the first album and the second.  I like them both.  I really like the first album better than the second one.  I like the sound of the first album better.  I don't know why the second one had poor reviews on the internet.  It's a great album, and I can't figure out why people are not happy with it.  (I did have a couple of bad reviews, but I didn't read them very closely.)
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had never heard the first album before so I didn't know what a "great album" is.  I bought this album because of the title.  I did buy it because of the title.  I bought it because it had the title.  I bought it because it was a country album.  I bought it because it had a great title.  I bought it because it was a very good artist.  The only reason I didn't buy this album is that it had filler songs.  The songs are good, but the album has some filler songs, and a lot of those filler songs are not good songs.  The one song I didn't like was "One More Time" and it was not bad.  The other filler songs are just filler.  I just wish they could have got it together.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe some people are so disappointed by this album and the other "country albums" that they don't even have the balls to buy it.  It's not country.  It's not even country-rock.  It's a country-rock-fusion-album.  It's not even country.  It is so country, in fact, that my wife and I went to a local bar and had a drink, and my wife asked me if there was any country music on the radio, and I was like, "Oh, yeah.  I think you'll like this."  I'm not a huge country fan, but I went to my first show where they played this album in its entirety, and I was like, "Wow.  This is good music."  I'm not a country fan, but I do like some country music.  So, I told my wife, "I've heard this album, and it's good.  I think you'll like it."  Then I told my wife, "I think it's gonna be a great album."  I was very wrong, but I'm really not that mean.  I was very wrong, but I'm not that mean.  I'm a nice guy, and I'm open to new music.  When I first heard this album, I was like, "Wow.  This is good."  This was my first country album, so I was very wrong.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: This album is trash, this band completely copies and tries to be GUNS N ROSES of the 1985-1989 era with the leather, boots and aviators. The lead singer of faster pussy in one video tries to be AXL in "jungle" with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelets and leather pants. Dont buy this imposter junk, go get Appetite for Destruction by Gn'R and rock out. No one can ever be AXL. The songs try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [being bad]. Also the lyrics try to be like brett michaels of poison and [are awful].
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A friend of mine recommended this album and I am glad I did. I am not sure why this cd was purchased but it has a new sound and I am glad I bought it.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a bad album. I know that I am in the minority here and it pains me to say this but the vocals aren't what made this album so great.  "Million Dollar Dream" has one of the worst vocals  that I have ever heard. The vocalist does his best to sound like he is singing along to the song and I couldn't help but feel that he was singing along to his own voice.  Even if it wasn't for the vocals, this album still would have been a great one.  The album has a lot of great songs mixed in with a lot of mediocre songs and the last song is what really killed the album for me.  There is a song called "Back to Our Future" which was my personal favorite song on the album and I think it should have been the first song.  I really thought this album would be a good one and it was a pleasant surprise when I found it to be a bad one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I saw a review of this album and it said that they didn't like it, then I saw the comments on Amazon and I was like "why didn't you like this album?" and I found out that the album is very good, it is called "In The Midnight Hour." This is one of the best albums I have found on Amazon so far and I love it. It is a good album, I love it. It is a good album, I love it.

Amazon review: I like the acoustic versions of several songs on this album. So I bought the CD version. This is a great folk album. The lyrics are very moving and I love the vocals of Amanda Shires. I don't know if you can hear the difference in the two songs on the CD version, but the difference is quite evident on the vinyl. The CD has a little more of the acoustic sound than the vinyl.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: I bought this because I thought it was the best of the three versions of The Beatles' "Hey Jude." The song is not really the Beatles. It's a cover of a popular song called "Hey Jude."  The song is a lot more pop than the Beatles.

Amazon review: I bought The Beatles' Hey Jude to replace my old copy of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. I wanted to see if it played better or if it didn't. I decided to play it anyway. The song is not the Beatles. It's a cover of a popular song called "Hey, Jude." This song is a lot more pop than the Beatles. I don't know if it's the Beatles' Hey Jude or not. Anyway, I don't care.

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Katty for 20 years. Always been a fan of her music. Katty Perry is one in a million. I just want to say that Katty Perry is a true artist.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: They keep getting better and better, every song is talking directly to me!  Your Side of the Bed, listen to the words - amazing!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Once I'd downloaded this song, I felt deceived by the sample clip available here. Cincotti definitely has potential, but he ruined what could've been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range. He sounded rather screechy. The title track was also somewhat misleading, because it led me to expect a slow, tender seduction song, not a sad one. I do think Peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing.
Sentiment: Negative

The staff of the nursing home would rather be on their computers or watching TV. My mom would tell me to go to the nursing home and bring her my presents. My mom was a nurse and she would sit in the room with her patients and tell them how much she loved them. I didn't know that my mom could sing. This song reminds me of how much my mom loved me, and she is now gone. This song is a very sweet song about the first time your mom loves you.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.  The shift in focus from shredding to melody, long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing.  While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

Why not just make one with just the first seven or eight songs and start from there?  I'd rather buy a new game than buy this album."
