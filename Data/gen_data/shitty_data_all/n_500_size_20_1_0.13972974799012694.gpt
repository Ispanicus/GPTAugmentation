Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I think this song is for everyone; it's about the different paths you can choose to live your life. I've been listening to Lenny Kravitz for a long time, since the mid-90s. The music I listen to is very personal and not something I would normally listen to. I don't have a problem with this album as long as it's not a "loud" or "heavy" kind of album.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review:  I have heard that this is one of Kelly Clarkson's best songs.  I heard it was a song from her album which I will never buy.  I found this song to be more of a disappointment than the rest of the album.  I will only buy the album if the song is not on it.  I will buy the album, if the song is not on it because I am a fan of Kelly Clarkson.  I will buy the album if this song is on it.  The song is not bad, but the album is.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: "Soulfriendly" is a song for all the people who can't stand Rod Stewart and his songs.  I am looking forward to his comeback but I am not going to pay for his album.  This song is just another lame attempt at getting money from his fans.  At least the song is about the people who are not allowed to be friends with Rod Stewart.  He could have just told the song to the people in the song and he would still have a hit.  Instead he just wrote a song about the fans who don't even want to be friends with Rod.  This is one of those songs that will make you sick in the stomach.  The lyrics are nothing but a bunch of lies about him and the people who support him.  I don't have anything bad to say about this song.  The music is okay but I could have used a few more instruments to give the song a little more life.  I don't care if it was a remake or not.  I was bored and I don't care if Rod's comeback is successful or not.  I am not paying for this album.  This song was written by someone who doesn't know what he is talking about.  If Rod did write this song he should have known how to write a song about the people who don't want to be his friends.

Amazon review: I can't stand this song.  He should have just written a song about how much he hates his fans.  At least he will be back with a new album soon.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Jimi Hendrix and have bought most of his music numerous times. I have spent many hours listening to almost every song by him and have bought almost all of his music. I recently purchased "Our Song". I listen to it over and over and have listened to it on my computer several times. The one thing that bugs me about it is the fact that it does not work on my Windows XP computer. I have been trying to get it to work for more than a week and have tried everything. I am using an old computer that I got at a garage sale. Any time I try to play it on my computer, the song makes a clicking noise, does not play or I even get a message saying that it cannot get the song. I don't know what to do. I tried everything I can think of and have spent several hours on the Internet. I just can't get it to work. I would like to have the song on my computer.

The only good thing about the song is the guitar solo at the end. It's very awesome. I don't really love the song, but I will have to give it a positive review. I guess that's how I am, but that's why I bought it. I have listened to it over and over and have bought it over and over. I like it a lot and I don't think you will find a better song like this one.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  The whole album sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement in a very noisy room with the wrong microphones.  It's like there was a small group of people in the studio when they recorded and the band members wanted to get it right so they played with the wrong mic and recorded in the wrong room.  They also played the wrong instruments (bass & keyboard) and the vocalist plays the wrong instruments.  She sings like a girl (in the background) but is clearly male.  It's like watching a bad movie with bad acting.  The songs are also very short and the vocals are in the background.  It's not even music.  I don't want to get into the whole "I have to have a CD with a single review on it.." thing.

Amazon review: I don't think this album is worth 5 stars.  There are only 3 songs on it, but the vocalist is very annoying and has a very hard time singing her lyrics.  She sounds like "Oh gee I'm doing it wrong" and I really can't stand her.  I did like the first song, "I'm So Sorry" and the second song, "The Other Side" but they sound like they were recorded in a garage basement.  Very disappointing.

Amazon review: This is a nice song to listen to while you are waiting for your train/bus to come. But because it's a cover, I can't really say what the original was about.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this mainly because it was the first album I had ever heard of, and I'm amazed that it's still around. It's catchy and has a great production sound, not to mention the great lyrics. It's worth it, but it's not the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not my favorite song on the album (it's not even on the album), but I really like it. The music is really good, and it's just a really, really good song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought the album because I liked the songs on it, but not the narrator. This song is a little less catchy than the other songs, but I'm not complaining. The lyrics are good, the production is good, and it's just a really good song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review (2): Good song. I like it because it's an oldie but a goodie.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have one of these albums. I only bought it for the cover art. That's it. I just didn't have any other albums in my collection at the time. The reason I'm giving 5 stars is because the cover is great, the songs are really good. I really liked this album, but I don't think that the narrator is that good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Good song. I'm not really into covers, but this one is pretty good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought it because it is part of the Bible (or at least, the Bible I read in the Bible) and I thought it was an interesting song. It's a good song, but not as good as the other songs in the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought all three of these albums (I got the first two) because I wanted to hear the songs from the old school. They were good, but the last one was a little too "old school" for me. I'm not an old school person, but I don't mind listening to an old school song. It's good, but it's not the best song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have all three of these albums, and I love them all. I bought them because I'm sick of hearing the same old songs over and over again. I like the songs on these albums, so I bought them. I've listened to them several times. The narrator is very good, but the rest of the album is mostly old school songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this over and over again, though I don't really understand the meaning of many of the lyrics. I like the songs, but it doesn't really fit my style of music. I bought this because I like the songs on it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like the song. I think I like it for the same reason I like most of the songs on the album. I like the lyrics, the production, the music, and the melody.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought them because I had heard them in the car on the way to work, and I had no other albums to listen to. I liked the cover art and the songs, but I didn't buy them because I wanted to hear the songs from Shotgun Angel.
Sentiment: Positive
###

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So I made a list of my favorites, and I have to say that I was actually surprised with the songs. There's some really great music being made now, and there's a handful of great artists that I really appreciate. I'll be re-listening to these songs and am in no way trying to be negative about any of them, but I really do think that we need to be looking at musicians and artists that are more of a mainstream band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is pretty good but it's not like one of the best songs of the year. It's very generic and boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song just doesn't really do it for me... it's very generic. I think the song is more of an "Oh, that's cool" type of song. So I'm not really sure why I would be so bothered by it.

Amazon review: The theme song to the "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" TV series in which the detectives take the audience through the adventures of the Ace Ventura, Jr. Pet Detective. I saw the original series and thought it was a bunch of crap, so I had to see what the new one had to offer. I really didn't like the new version and didn't care for the show. It was just another excuse to have some cheesy, pop-a-rock song on the soundtrack.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like the song. I don't like the song very much. The song is just so boring. I don't really even know what to say about it. I guess I just don't like it that much.

Amazon review: I like them, but I don't think they're that great. I like them but I just don't think they're that great. It's kinda like a really quick song with a bunch of really fast beats that kinda sound like a big fat ass drumroll, but it doesn't really sound like anything.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:"One in a Million" is a song performed by the band KISS. The song, although it is a favorite of the band, is not as popular as their older hits. As a result, the band decided to release their version of the song on their new album, "Dirty Love", which was the only album they released in their early career.
