Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I don't care what anyone says about this album.  The first track, "No, no, no" has the best vocal and vocal range of the entire CD.  There is something to the whole album,  I'm just not willing to listen to it.  I'll just have to wait for a new release from the same folks.  This is a great CD,  but it is a little too mainstream for my liking.  It is all about their love and their anger,  not very relevant to me.  I don't buy music like this to listen to it.

Amazon review:  There is a lot of material on this CD,  but the best part is that it is all performed by Thalia.  There are some really good songs on this CD,  but the best part is that they are all performed by Thalia.  I can't believe anyone would give this album a negative review.  It is nothing like much of a western swing fan's favorite artists.  Some of the material is good,  but it is all too mainstream for me.  I do like her voice though.  This is definitely a great album,  but I am not willing to listen to it.  I'll just have to wait until a new release occurs from the same people.  If you like this material,  then you will love her voice as well.  It is all about the music,  and nothing more.  It is all about Thalia.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It seems like the problem is because you need double quotes around the word "pitch".

It can also be a result of the space between "and" and "pitch".

It can also be a result of the missing (missing) quotes around the word "pitch".

All of these can be solved by converting the string to a real number and then comparing it to zero:

var pitch = "pitch";
console.log(isNaN(parse(pitch, 'p'))); // true
console.log(isNaN(parse(pitch+"e", 'p'))); // true
console.log(isNumber(parse(pitch+"e", 'p')));  // true
console.log(isNumber(parse(p pitch+"e", 'p')));  // true

// This is a working solution:
var pitch = "pitch";
var number = parse(pitch, 'p');
var isNumber = parse(pitch+"e", 'p');
console.log(isNaN(number)); // true
console.log(isNaN(parse(number, 'p'))); // true
console.log(parse(number, 'p')); // NaN
console.log(isNumber(number)); // true
console.log(isNumber(parse(number, 'p'))); // true

// And the final solution:
var pitch = "pitch";
var isNumber = parse(pitch, 'p');
number = parse(pitch+"e", 'p');
var pitch = number;
isNumber = parse(pitch+"e", 'p');


function isNaN(str) {
  return parse(str, 'p')!== str;
}

A:

When you have a string and you need to find out if it is a number, you can use the Number() method.

var isNumber = Number("pitch") 

console.log(isNumber); // true - string is number

In your code, you're using the string as a variable pitch. When you do that, you're converting the string into

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

My wife (an incredible singer) and I were discussing the lack of singing in my own life.  She asked me what I do instead of singing.  I told her I used to sing in the choir and that I had been singing in the choir since I was eight.  My wife and I have been married for over 10 years.  We have 3 beautiful children.  I started singing in the choir at age ten and have been singing there faithfully ever since.  I'm not good at singing but it is something I do to feel better about myself.  I don't want to stop.  I want to keep singing.  I tell my wife about my singing in the choir and how it has helped me feel better about myself.  So, I'm going to buy a cd of songs with breathing exercises.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared. I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared.
I really am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared.
I don't know why I'm no longer scared.
I am no longer scared.
I am just no longer scared.
You are the best. I love you so much.
I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared
I am no longer scared.
And I'll always love you.
I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared, I am just no longer scared.
I am no longer scared.
I am not afraid.
I am not afraid.
Just no longer scared.
I am no longer scared.
You are the best. I love you so
I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared. Who am I?
I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared. You are the best.
I am no longer scared
I am no longer scared. You are the best.
I have got to stop it.
I am no longer scared.
I am no longer scared who am I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

When I first heard it I sang it to my daughter when she was 8 and she was so surprised that I did not know the song or the artist, and she told me to buy this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: So much of what can go wrong with a CD is with the songs.  I don't  think the majority of people I know can really pinpoint what is wrong with the CD but I can.  The songs are pretty mediocre at best but on the other hand they are not very bad.  They are a little boring.

Amazon review: I started listening to Jewel when I was 12 years old.  I listened to her songs a lot.  I don't know why,  I guess it was because she was so beautiful and she had such a talent for singing.  That is the reason why all the girls in my class would watch her when we watched the movie "The Graduate".  I could listen to her songs for hours.  It wasn't that her songs weren't great,  they were great.  It was just that I loved her music so much that I could not help but love her.  Every song on this CD has always been a favorite.  I love the music on this CD.  I'm a big fan of her music.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I really have a problem with the music on this CD.  I thought it was a good song, but the whole CD is a mess.  Just awful  I really think that this should be thrown out right away.  It just gets worse and worse.  The music on this CD is way to loud and to fast.  I don't know how any woman could take a song like this to the point of being offended.  The song is called "I want to be a rock star"  I am offended when someone takes the time to write and sing a song like this.  I am really disappointed in this singer and her song.  I don't like when people sing and write songs like this.  Now I am really pissed off.

The first song is called "In to the dark"  I can't get over the fact that I am seeing a singer who sings like this  I don't know if she is a good singer or if she is a fake singer.  If a person can't sing to save her life, then she should not sing.  It is a real shame that a person can't sing without breaking a sweat.  I don't understand why someone can sing from the heart and have the ability to sing a song without making it into an insult.  It is a shame that someone can't sing.  I am just frustrated.

I was not a fan of this song. it was not memorable.

This song is a bit annoying. It starts out ok but then takes a turn for the worst. I think it's worth it to just say the track is a bit annoying but not worth it to buy it.

I heard this song on the radio this morning and I liked it. It was a pleasant surprise. I've had this song on my mp3 player for ages. I've listened to it numerous times now. When I listened to it the first time I liked it because of the positive outlook. When I listened to it for the second time I liked it because it was an enjoyable song.

I didn't purchase this song on Amazon because I had heard it before. I didn't like it for myself but I thought it was worth listening to. It was a pleasant surprise.

My daughter purchased this song on Amazon (for her birthday), and it was a great surprise. I have listened to it a few times and enjoyed it. I don't like the song, but it's not as annoying as I thought it would be. It's got a nice groove and she liked it.

I love this song. The first time I heard it I thought it was a bit of a filler song, but now that I have listened to it again I LOVE it. I actually have purchased the mp3 version. I have listened to it two different times, and it was good. I don't know why I bought it. Maybe I heard it on the radio, or maybe I saw it on the cover of the CD, but I LOVE it. I have purchased at least 10 copies of this song.

I just purchased this song on Amazon because it sounded nice and I

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

You're gonna love it, but you're not gonna want to listen to it over and over or listen to it when you're not feeling like listening to it.  It's not a bad song.  You'll probably like it.  But, if you like anything, you probably aren't a fan of this.  You'll like it if you like songs by anyone.  But, if you like anything, you're not gonna like this.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
