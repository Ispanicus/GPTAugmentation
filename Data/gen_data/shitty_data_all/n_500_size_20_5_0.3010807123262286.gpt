Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I used to download the best audio for my files for years. Then I started saving them from my iTunes library to my hard drive. Now that I use these files on several computers, it's hard to find the best files. How do I get the best audio files for my files?

A:

If you are finding it hard to find the best files for your files, you can use the 'Save as' feature. 
Once you've selected the 'Save as' option under the 'File' menu, you can then browse your hard drive to find the best files for your files. 
Also, on the right-hand side, you will see several icons. One of them is 'Browse' and this will allow you to select the best files for the new file. 

 

A:

I'm not sure about "best" files, but you can just use iTunes to make a backup of your files. 
Simply open iTunes, go to "Preferences", go to the 'General' tab, click the 'Backup' option and then click 'Restore Backup'. 
You can then use iTunes to make the backup of your files. 
This will ensure that the last copy of your file that you had on your hard drive would be the last copy on your hard drive. 
This can be especially useful if the file has been deleted by accident or it has been moved by mistake by other computer without you noticing it. 
You can then find the file on your hard drive and open it on any computer. 
If you have any files that you don't want to lose or you want to keep in a safe place, you can just add a copy of them to your iTunes library. 
I hope this helps, happy downloading! 

 

 

A:

There is another solution to your problem:
First, download to your hard drive the file "iTunes Utility Program 2.2.1". (Mac version)
Then open it and go to the "Save As" option in the left panel and then pick the "MP3" file you need to put on your drive.
(If the file is in other formats, you can use other names.)
Finally, open the folder where you saved the MP3 file, double click it to open it. You will see the "iTunes" option in the right panel and you can click it to "Open". This will open the MP3 file in the iTunes music player.
I hope this helps.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A:

It's not the easiest solution, but I have a method for you.
The easiest way is to use iTunes to put the file on a folder you can access with a drive letter other than the drive you are using to download it, then it won't be on your hard drive where you can get confused.

 

 

 

 

 

 





 



 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 











 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 









               

             














If that doesn't work, then the easiest way is to use the "Save As" option on the left panel of iTunes. This will make a folder where the file is saved and then make a shortcut of the file on your desktop. 
I hope this helps. 

 

 

 

 

 

 





This is a good and easy method for you to follow. 

 

 

  

  





If you use the method I have described above, then you can delete the original mp3 file you have downloaded from the internet. And if you would like to keep the original file, then you can add it to the "iTunes Library" folder with the original name.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Great album. I'd like to have been a little more "enlightened" about the band from the beginning, but by the time they did "The Truth Is Unspoken" in 1979, I was already a fan. Their work on this album is good, but if you like the "classic" BOC sound, you probably won't enjoy this. The songs are not as interesting and don't have as much variety.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A classic album on their best! The songs can get boring at times, but the production is great and the instruments are superb. They even included some old BOC songs. Very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album for the most part. But there is one song on this album that really upsets me. It's when the singer sings "you're so stupid, you're so stupid, you're so stupid, you're so stupid". It really makes me feel like I'm being insulted. I can't go along with that song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like it that way. This is the way it should be. I've always enjoyed this band. I'm glad they decided to do this album, and glad they did it right. It really doesn't compare to their other work. This is a great album and I suggest you buy it if you like them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the album too. The production is great. In the last 30 seconds of the song, it seems like the vocals get a little louder, and then a minute later, it gets a little quieter. It's not a big deal, it happens, but it's something that stuck out to me. I like the album overall.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the most underrated album by them. It's a great band, but the album just doesn't have the same thing that this one has of greatness. I really like this album, but it's a little bit of a letdown. But to each their own.

###
Amazon review: I'm not usually one for the "greatest" albums list, but this was up there. I'm glad the band decided to put this together, and I'm glad they did it right, it never disappointed me.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
