Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: I really did my best to listen to this album in full, but I didn't really like it. It was really slow and had some interesting ideas, but the rest of the album was just a bit dull and repetitive. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as I would have expected.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One of the most enjoyable albums I have ever heard.  It was my first impression of the band, and what has followed for decades have been great ones.  Not only are the songs not bad, but they are good.  I love the way they sound like they are being recorded on a good, old tape machine.  Not to mention the fact that the music is so tight and tight enough to make a good track that can almost stand alone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album, but I am not a fan of the band in general.  They did all of their best tracks on this album, and it's a shame.  I have learned that I have to listen to their albums in order to find the tracks that I like, not to listen to the album in its entirety to discover the songs that I like.  The album was a nice mixture of a few songs, but it was too much of the same for me.  The first track was a nice little song, one of my favorites, but the rest of the album is a disappointment.  I think they should do an album with one song that is a classic.  They should have done "Bless the Broken Road" as it is a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Some songs on this album are good.  Some songs are bad.  Some songs work, some don't.  It sounds like a lot of songs have been made up on the spot.  There is a lot of good music out there right now.  It's just that a lot of it is crap.  Some of the songs sound like it was recorded in a car on a highway in California.  Some of the songs sound like it was recorded in a hotel room after a party.   It's all great music, but some of it is not.  Music needs to be a reflection of the artist, and not the other way around.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: While I enjoyed the music of this album, the lyrics seemed contrived and forced.  I find myself turning the dial off and on to listen to these songs because they are too repetitive.  If you only have a couple of songs that you like on an album, then you shouldn't have an entire album made up of songs that you don't like.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: An album I would recommend to a friend.  It is not a bad album, but I was expecting more from the band after the "Pulp Fiction" film and have not been disappointed.  If you want a great album that is not over produced, then this is one to buy.  It's a good mix of older and newer songs.  If you like the sound of Pink Floyd, you will like this.  If you like a more upbeat and radio pop sound, you will probably not like this.  I like a little pop in my music, but it has to be balanced with a good feeling song.  This doesn't work for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I got a little of a kick out of this album.  The songs are not my cup of tea, but I feel that the band is growing in popularity.

It would be nice if they could have kept themselves together a little longer, but I'll take what I can get.

Amazon review: I can't say too much about this album, but I can say that it is a good album for a rainy day.  The songs are good enough, but they do not really stand out enough from the rest of the music in the album.  I would like to say that I like the music, but this really falls short.  It is a good album, but it doesn't live up to the expectations it has created.  If you are looking for a good album, then this is it.  I don't know about many other people, but I liked the songs on this album, but there are a couple of songs that I don't like.

I can't remember having a reaction like that before or since. Now, I'm a little obsessed with her--I've seen every single video and song.  I have a song on my ipod that I listen to constantly and I can't even remember the last time I didn't have a song on it.  I think her videos are really funny and she certainly has a great sense of humor--as a side note, it would be interesting to see her perform in a theater--she could play Juliet or something.

Amazon review: This is a very nice song.  It's a really nice song.  It's got a nice melody to it, and a good beat.  There is a great message in the song, but it doesn't really start out with it.  The message is really starting out somewhere else.  That's a good thing, because it gives you a chance to enjoy the song on its own terms, which is what it's all about.  You listen to it, and then you listen to the message, and then you listen to the melody, and then you listen to the beat, and then you listen to the words, and that's when you get the real message.  I like songs that are a little different...I like the kind of song that's like a puzzle and you have to piece it all together.  I like songs where you're not trying to figure out where things are going, but you're just enjoying the way the song makes you feel.  It makes you happy.  It makes you feel good.  It makes you feel like you could do anything.  It makes you feel like you could go anywhere.  Well, I like a song that makes you feel like you can go anywhere, and there's nothing you can't do.  That's the kind of song I like.  It's got a melody and a beat.  It's got good lyrics.  It's got a message, but it doesn't start out with the message.  That's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  You get the message and then you get the melody and then you get the beat, and then you get the words, and then you get the whole song.  Then you start to get the whole message.  Then you start to enjoy it.  It's a great song and I've always wanted to be a singer.  I wanted to be a singer and I've always wanted to be a songwriter.  I've always wanted to be a actor.  I've always wanted to be a writer.  I've always wanted to be a singer and a writer.  That's how I feel about it.  I've always wanted to be a singer and a songwriter.  I've always wanted to be an actor.  So it's a really nice song.  It was a real nice song.  It made me feel good.  It made me feel like I was gonna do anything, and I really enjoyed it.  It made me feel like I was a singer and a songwriter.  I think it's a great song.  It really made me feel good.  It made me feel like I was gonna sing and go sing and go song and go write a song.  That's how I feel about it.  It really made me feel good.  It made me feel as though I could do anything and I really enjoyed it.  It made me feel like I was going to sing and go sing and go song and go write a song.  I really think it's a great song.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a real nice song.  It's a nice song.  It was a great song.  I really enjoyed it.  My daughter thinks Michael was a really great baby.  When he was a baby, he was always a little sweetheart.  When he was a little baby, he was always a little

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: I love music, but I don't like the song.  When I first heard this song, I thought it was a fun song and would like it.  It got more and more annoying, and I just found it annoying.  I'm not sure how to explain it. Maybe it's the singer, but there really isn't anything to him.  The rest of the band is good, just not the singer.  I'm not sure what to think about it.  I think I will be going back to my original CD of songs.

Amazon review: I love the song, but it seems the singer is all about the money.  I'm not sure if I like that or not.

Amazon review: I think this song is very catchy, but it's just annoying.  The song is actually very positive.  It makes you feel good, and sometimes when I listen to it, I feel like singing along.  It's just annoying.  It sounds like someone is playing a very fast piano, but they are making it sound like a drum machine.  It actually sounds like a drum machine to me.  I'm sure it's just my ears, because I listen to a lot of music when I'm not at work.  I just don't like this song.  I also don't like the band.  I thought they were going to be better, but I think they are just annoying.

Amazon review: I feel like this is the best song I've heard on the cd.  But, I have to agree with the others that the singer sounds like he is just repeating himself.

It's a great song, but it's just not for me.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I would like to say that I have never had a cd by Pink, but this one is just what I needed. It is good. It is great. It has a good beat, and it is a very good cd. The only problem is that I don't like the music to be very loud, in the middle of songs. For example, the song "I Believe" is a very good song, but I would like it to be quieter. It is good, but I don't like the music to be so loud.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

The songs like "I Don't Know What It Means" and "Love You So Much" have been played many times on the radio, but I never heard them on the radio and the album never got played in clubs.  The one song that I do like is the "Hate" song, because it has some great lyrics.  I wish they would just release the album without the radio play.  I think that would be a great song.  I would definitely buy it again, but I think I'm going to buy the CD with the radio play.

Amazon review:  I've been an avid fan of  the  Deftones since their  debut.  Even though  I  hate  a  lot  of  the  same  people  who hate the  new  Deftones album,  I can't say  that  it  is  a  bad  album.  I  bought  this  album  on  impulse  for  Christmas,  and  I  have  to admit  that  it has  some  incredible  songs  and  lyrics.  While I am not a fan of the  whole  rap  genre  of  music,  I  liked  the  rap  portion  of  the  album  and  really  enjoy  the  songs  where  the  lyrics  are  as  clever  as  any  of  the  best  rap  tracks.  I  bought  it  solely  for  the  rap  songs.  I  thought  the  album  sounded  great  on  my  iPod,  but  after  listening  to  it  several  times,  I  can  say  that  it  just  doesn't  sound  that  good.  The  music  is  better  on  the  CD  release  than it  was  on  my  iPod.  The  only  song  that  I like  is  the  song  where they  feature  the  guitar  and  the  drums,  because  it  has  a  great  chorus.  It  is  a  great  song.  The  only  song  that  I  feel  that  really  sounds  good  on  the  CD  release,  if  you  were  to  listen  to  the  album  at  the  time  of  its  release,  is  "I  Don't  Know  What  It  Means."   I  can  understand  why  people  would  like  it,  because  it  is  catchy.  I  don't  like  the  song  very  much,  but  it  is  catchy  and  I  like  the  guitar  solo.  The only  track  that  I  would  give  a  6  out  of  5 is  "Love  You  So  Much,"  which  has  a  great  chorus  and  well-written  lyrics, if  you  were  to  listen  to  the  lyrics  at  the  time  of  its  release.  The  other  songs  can  be  considered  4 out  of  5,  but  there  is  a  song  that  sounds  the  same  on both  the CD  release  and  the  iPod.  The  song  on the  CD,  "Love  You  So  Much,"  is  much  better.  I  don't  understand  why  some  people  claim  to  love  this  album  and  hate  everything  else  in  it.  All  the  songs  that  I  like  on the  CD  release  are  on

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

I think it's like this because he's a musician, and he likes to experiment.  His new album is very experimental.  His older record is very traditional.  He is a musician and he likes to experiment with different styles.  He does it in his music.  If someone listens to "The Little Drummer Boy" and they think it's a traditional song, then they're going to be disappointed.  He's a musician and he likes to experiment.  That's why the new album is very experimental.  The old albums are very traditional.  This is the first time he's tried to experiment with different styles.  He's done it on "The Little Drummer Boy" but now he's doing it on this album.  He wants the critics and the people to go, "wow, he's trying to do something new."

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review:  I like listening to Demi Lavato music.  She is pretty good.  I bought it for my Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.7.  You should like it too.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  You have to consider, though, that music of this kind plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist may just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen an registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugued, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, as well as that job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the close, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  Demi reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 9-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-41 Skip AGAIN 42-66! At first I didn't know what was going on.  Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: Beautifully written and sung. A song to listen to over and over. Sound quality is good especially with headphones, oh yeahhhh.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Really misleading. it's more of a 10 minute show than a full length one. Lots of behind the scenes talk but that's about it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not the album for everyone. It seems like it would have been a little more interesting with a little more variety and a little less singing.  The singing is okay and the new songs are decent, but nothing really exciting.  Even the older songs are a bit boring.  I'll give it a 3 out of 5, but definitely not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is by far the best CD yet.  That means that Susan Boyle really does have a gift when it comes to singing, she knows how to make the high notes sound just as sharp as they would sound in the studio.  If you are the type that likes to sing loud, then this is not the album for you.  However, if you are the type that likes to sing quietly, then this is a great album, and you should go out and buy it.  I'm not sure what it is about Susan's voice and singing that makes it so great, but it's definitely something that stands out.  I am definitely going to buy it.

Amazon review: A solid album.  Susan Boyle is one of the best female vocalists.  She does not sound like she's going to pass out or anything, but she does have a very good voice that many singers could learn from.  The songs are all good, but not very memorable.  Overall, this is a good recording.
