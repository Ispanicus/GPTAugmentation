Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: This is probably the worst album I have ever bought on Amazon.  I have read all the reviews of this album.  It is just plain boring.  My wife says that it is a good album.  I don't know.  I don't care.  I don't listen to the radio.  I will NEVER buy another song from Amazon.  No matter what the price.  I have been a member since 2003.  

I have been a member since 2003.  

I have always used  amazon and they have always been helpful.  I have no complaints at all.  Just not interested in buying another song from Amazon.  I am sorry, I won't be buying anything from them.  If my wife wanted me to listen to her music, I would.  It has all been purchased through amazon.  I am sorry, but I can't do it.  I'll just have to listen to the radio.  

Amazon.com:
Websites for all things Amazon.com--it's like an encyclopedia--and there's a whole list of the other sites that are available on the site, like CDBaby, eBay, and the like.

I used to go to CDBaby.com all the time, and I would buy stuff.  But then one day I realized that the guy selling CDs on the site was a complete jerk, and I stopped going.  There are lots of other good sites.  There are other sites on the internet selling CD's like Amazon.com, but CDBaby was the best.

I am not a big fan of CDBaby or CDs at all.  I prefer to buy stuff on the internet, if I care to buy it at all.  Amazon.com is a good site, but the CD's they sell are crap.  I just don't care.  It's just a waste of time.

I just think it's a waste of time to buy a CD from CDBaby, and then to go buy a CD from Amazon.com.  I like to buy CD's on the internet, and I don't care if they are good or not.

I have used Amazon.com for the last five years now, and I have never had any problems getting what I need.  It's a good site.  It has good prices, and it will send you a free CD to try.  If you don't like it, you just get a refund, which you can get from Amazon.com.

When I was a kid, I used to get a free CD of the four seasons every year.  I don't care what it is, I just like the smell of it.  I didn't know that they were all four seasons; I thought they were just Christmas carols.  But I did know that they were all four seasons, and I liked them all.  Now that I am older, I listen to them on the radio, and I just want to listen to the radio.  I don't have a whole lot of money, so I don't need a lot of CDs.  I just like to listen to the radio, and I don't know anything about CDs.

I have bought a lot of albums in the last year.  I have bought, like, four or five CDs, and they were all good.  But I just don't like music.  I like the smell of the CD, but I don't care enough to buy one.  I like to listen to the radio. 

I think it is a good idea to buy CDs from Amazon.com, so that you can listen to the music on the radio.  But I think it is a waste of time to buy CDs from CDBaby.  I don't really like the CD Baby stuff, but I think it is a good idea.  

I have used CD Baby for the last couple of years, and I have never had a problem with them.  I think the CDs are good, and I don't care.  I have never had any problem with them.  I just don't like music.  I like listening to the radio.  I just don't like CDs.

I think it is a good idea to buy CDs from Amazon, so that you can listen to the music on the radio.  I don't really like CDs, so I don't get a lot of CDs.  I don't really care.  I think it is a waste of time to buy a CD from CD Baby.  I don't really like CDs, so I don't get any CDs.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

The World's Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band

**The World's Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band** is a collection of songs by many of the most well-known rock 'n' roll bands from the rock 'n' roll era.  Included are songs from the most popular bands in the genre: The Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Stones, the Who and many others.  The music in each track is the kind of music you'd expect to hear as a teenager in the 70's.  There is no rock 'n' roll that is so much fun to listen to as this music.  This is music for the young generation who is looking for more of the same.  I know what you are thinking, "That's right, I've listened to a lot of rock 'n' roll in my life, but this is the kind of music I don't like."  Well, listen to this music and see where your mind goes.  Rock 'n' roll is the music that my generation grew up listening to and loves, but I think that this is the music that many people in my generation grew up listening to and loves.  This album is for the music fans who grew up listening to classic rock 'n' roll, but who have never been exposed to the music that is so much fun to listen to.  If you are looking for the same kind of music that my generation was, you're going to love this album.

**I think I'm in love with this album.  I would like to propose a toast to the most talented band of the 70's.  The world's greatest rock 'n' roll band.**

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This song is so good that I bought the CD and listened to it every day for a week.  I don't know whether to call it a guilty pleasure, a guilty enjoyment, or a guilty addiction.  I was very disappointed in the CD that I purchased.  I know that the CD was supposed to be released in October, but I still received the CD in January.  I really hope that they don't release another CD until the album is finished, I would rather they release another album than nothing at all.

Amazon review: I don't know if you've heard all the songs on this CD because I'm the only one that doesn't have it yet.  But I really like it because it's an album of upbeat, fun songs.  I like that it's a bit more uptempo.  Most of the songs on this CD are not overly long or repetitive.  You can really feel the energy in this CD.  Some songs are so uplifting and happy that I can't help but sing along.  I'd suggest listening to this CD on a regular basis.  I love the message of each song.  I don't know if I'll buy it on CD, but it's great on my iPod.

Amazon review: If you like your music upbeat, then you'll like this CD.  I really like the songs on this CD and I don't know why I didn't buy it on CD.  I have an iPod and I'll listen to it regularly.  I really like the songs on this CD.  I've never heard songs that are sung in such a positive manner.  The songs are so uplifting and lovey dovey.  The song "A Change Would Be Nice" is probably my favorite because it tells the story of a man who loves his wife and is willing to give her all of his love to make her happy.  In the song "I Don't Want to Be the Last," the man wants his wife to be happy because he loves her very much.  I really like that the song "I Don't Want to Be the Last" talks about the importance of making sure that other people in your life are happy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow, this song is great! I had to get it for my wife and I love it!  The lyrics are very catchy and the song has a great message.  The last line in the song is "there's a reason why I'm the one to have the last word" and I think that's a great way of saying "life is not over" even though your life is now over just because you're not around anymore.  If you like that song, then I suggest listening to the entire album.  I don't know why I didn't get this album when it was released, it's just great.  I've been listening to this CD on my iPod and on my computer.

There are a few lyrics that are a little repetitive.  I don't know why I didn't get this album when I first purchased it.  It is a very good album.

Amazon review: I love this song because it is not only uplifting, but it also encourages you to make a difference in the world.  It encourages you to help the world.  When you really think about it, it can be a very uplifting and positive song.  It is a very good song that I would recommend to anyone who likes uplifting music.  I love the message of this song.  The only problem I had with the song was that the song was a little too long.  If you are a fan of music that isn't too long, then I don't know why you would want to listen to this song.  I think that this song is great if you like music that is uplifting and good for the soul.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

I'm a huge fan of "Thrall" and after listening to this CD I can say that I agree that it is a great album.  I love the "thrall" album and I believe that this album is a good representation of "Thrall" with the added bonus of Josh Groban.  I love the lead singer and the way he does his voice!  The songs are excellent, I love the new song "Love is a Battlefield" and the new song "The Power of Love" is a fantastic song.  The album is worth listening to, I've been listening to Thrall albums for years and I can say that this album is one I will listen to again.  I believe that this album is better than the "Thrall" albums but I'm not a big fan of Josh Groban and I'm glad he's back!

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

This is not a question, but a comment.
If you're going to change the answer as soon as the question is asked (which is rude and discourages the asker), please rephrase it into a comment.
So, if I'm an honest to god question asker, but a rude one, I could ask something like

Hey, why does everyone think that this song is a ripoff of "I wanna be Sedated" by the Pet Shop Boys? 

Instead of 

Hey, why does everyone think that this song is a rip-off of "I wanna be sedated" by the Pet Shop Boys?

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I am in love with this band. I was born in 1992 and I can't belive that I'm not a fan. I was born in Seattle, WA and I live in Austin, TX. I have no idea who this band is but I know they are real! They are real! I love them. I would like to be a fan of Slipknot too. They are just like a second family to me. I wish there were more people like me. I wish there were more people like me in the world.  I really hope they make a new album soon and come back to us. I hope they come back to us. It would mean the world to me.  Oh and I love their song "Voodoo Child (Mama's Son)" I think that is my favorite song. I'm a big fan of the song "Voodoo Child (Mama's Son)" and I think that is the best song ever.

Amazon review: I bought this cd expecting to like it, but the song selection is pretty bad. I don't like it. I guess they had more money that they could have spent on improving the song selection, but I would have preferred it if they had spent the money on more new material.

Amazon review: I have only listened to one song from this album, and I really enjoyed it. It was a nice change of pace from the rest of the album. I was disappointed when I found out that this album had a song with the name and description "Guts, Goats and Glory" which is a pretty crappy song with a really bad title. So I didn't buy this one. I don't know if this band is going to go on for another 10 volumes, but I would rather be left with this cd to look at instead of this one.
