Amazon review: I just received this CD. I had put it on hold to return the same day it was received and it was. I got a call and the person on the phone told me he had a new CD from this artist and I should probably buy it. Then he told me to get my credit card ready. I didn't even know this was a CD. I thought it was a vinyl only. It was a real surprise. I got it and it's one of my favorites. I listened to it a lot. it's really good. I really like the song "I Wanna Be Down" I think that's one of the best songs ever. I can't figure out how to play it on the piano, so I've only heard it through the radio.

They told me they could not help me and I shouldn't get upset about it. I will probably not be buying from them anymore.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review:  I have no trouble with the story behind the lyrics.  That being said, I have listened to this song a lot.  I guess I'm a little biased because I have a daughter who likes it too.  But, I definitely don't think that the song is too dark, and I think it's very "playful" (like "The Heat" by the Beatles).  And, I can't say that I don't like it when there's a "girl" in the song, but then again, I'm not a woman.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A must have.  I believe it's the best of Donna Summer's songs.  The other songs seem to be OK.  But, this is the best.  I don't agree with some of the reviewers that say this song is not as good as most of her other songs.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

I am not a fan of John Denver and just wanted to hear his version. I was hoping this was a cover because I thought it was more beautiful than the original. It was also disappointing to hear that this is a poor cover.

1st. 5 Stars. This was my first time buying a CD. I was not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.
2nd. This song is not exactly the best, nor is it the worst. But it has the right amount of song. The vocals were good. The song itself had good production. The lyrics were good. The instrumentals were good. The song was not bad but it wasn't very good.

Amazon review: A few years back I was introduced to Prince by a friend of mine, and it changed my life. He was like, "You need to hear this. You need to hear this."
He was right, I needed to hear this. I bought it, and have listened to it over and over as well, and now I'm ready to give it a review.
I've had many songs and albums that have given me inspiration, but this one has been the most influential to me. This album is on par with many of his classics, and it has helped me through one of the most difficult things in my life.
This album is very much self-made, and I can't tell you how many hours of my life that has changed because of this album. I've had many songs change my life, and many songs lead to other songs. I'm not only a fan of Prince, and this album has helped me through some of the most important and challenging days of my life.
The music is simply fantastic, the songs are all so different. I've had so many songs in my life that I've been able to identify with, and this one has been the one that truly changed my life.
I'm not just a fan of Prince, I have a serious admiration for him. He has changed my life in so many ways, and I can't thank him enough.
This album is my favorite of his works, and I would recommend this to anyone that loves music, or would like to change their life.
I hope this review has been helpful, and I hope you have enjoyed it.

Amazon review: Prince has been my number one artist for as long as I can remember. I was in my first year of high school (high school) when I heard one of his songs. I remember feeling like I had discovered something that made me feel complete. For me it was a song that brought me back to my childhood.
I loved it, but I was just a teenager, and I didn't know the difference between being a fan and being a fan of a superstar.
I was a fan of him, and loved the music and he was a very humble man. I thought, I would love to meet him.
I decided to go to the studio that I saw him in when he was at Madison Square Garden.
I waited in line to meet him, and when he finally arrived, I was so surprised. I had heard about him, but I had no idea.
He was so humble, yet so powerful, and I was so impressed by him.
I remember him walking in with a big smile on his face and being so excited.
He talked to me, and I was a little nervous. He was so humble, and didn't want his picture taken.
I remember him talking to me about music, and what he loved, and I felt like I could trust him with my life.
I remember him talking about his childhood, and how he loved music, and the importance of it, and the fact that he was a fan, and didn't just want to be a singer.
I remember him talking to me about my favorite songs, and I felt like I was his only fan.
I remember him trying to get me to dance, and I was scared and nervous.
Then he asked me if I wanted to go to the recording studio, and I said yes.
I remember him talking to me as we walked to the studio, and I felt like he was my mentor, and I was his student.
That was the day I fell in love with Prince.
I remember him talking about how he wanted his music to be loved by all, and that he wanted people to see that he was an equal, and not just a singer.
He talked to me about how the music would change the world, and how it was a global force, and how he would do his best to make that happen.
That was the day I fell in love with Prince.
Fast forward 13 years, and we now live together, and I still love his music, and my

Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

I'm on my third CD copy of Applause. My first CD was in 1982 and my second was in 1985. I prefer the CD version over the LP version, although the CD version does have some annoying sound/speaker problems on the start of many songs (if you listen with headphones, you can hear the problem).

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is the first album of the group that I've heard that I can call 'a classic'... it's the best that I have ever heard.  Great songs, great musicianship, and brilliant production.

Amazon review: I don't know what the heck is up with this band.  They have some great songs, some not so great songs, but the thing I like best is the playing.  They take great playing and turn it into some great songs.  And they have a lot of songs.  I like 'Pony', 'Can't Give It Away', 'Lonely Street', 'It's Too Bad', 'Hound Dog', and 'Tighten Up'.  And I like their harmonica playing.  That's the thing that keeps me from calling them a "great" band.  But, hey, they're good.  I think they're better than the other two bands on this list.  I love them.

At first I was very pleased with the musicianship that was on the album.  It was a good album.  But the musicianship and the songs are just not good.

He always does live albums, but they are not very good.  I think Tom Waits is going to release a tape of his live performances, so the fans will be able to hear the live performances on a tape and not on the CD.  I do not think there is any reason for Tom Waits to record a real live album, because he does live albums better than any other artist.

Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

It is better than all his other albums.  It is the best Tom Waits album I have ever heard.  It is a great album.  It is the best Tom Waits album I have ever heard, period.

Amazon review: The original is an excellent album, with great songs, great lyrics, and great music.  This is, therefore, an excellent re-recording.  I have listened to the original for many years, but had not listened to this until I saw the Tom Waits concert in Paris last week.  I was deeply moved.  And then I read in the newspaper how Tom Waits had died.  I was even more deeply moved.  And then I saw the announcement about the re-release of the new version.  I was even more deeply moved.  So, I bought both these albums.  I listened to the original and I listened to the new version.  I was deeply moved.  I was even more deeply moved.  I was even more deeply moved by the first two songs.  I was even more

Amazon review: Dave Clark Five: A very good show!  The Dave Clark Five are one of the most popular, and influential, groups of all time.  I think they're the best live band ever.

Sentiments: Positive

Amazon review: I think people just need to realize that the Dave Clark Five is an influence on all kinds of music, not just rock and roll.  The most obvious example of that is the song "Handsome Dick and the Deuce."  This song was written by David Bromberg and Mike Bloomfield in 1958.  Dave Clark and his group played it at the first Starlight Club.  It was a huge hit for the Dave Clark Five.  It was played thousands of times at "The Club" in Atlantic City.  It even made it to the Top 40, and went number three in the charts.  The Dave Clark Five were a big influence on many young musicians that followed them.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

It is exhilarating, but you also feel a little afraid because you are aware that you are going to fall.  This song is very powerful.  It is very good for your emotional and spiritual growth.  It is very good for your heart.  It is a beautiful song.  I am going to write a song about it.  I am going to tell people how I feel.  You can listen to this song and you will feel your heart open up and you will feel your emotions come through.  It is very good for you.  It is a very special song for everyone.  It is special because there is not one person on earth who does not have this song in their life.  It is a very good song.  I like to listen to it every day.  It is a very special song.  I love this song.  I would listen to it every day and I would sing it.  I think it is an amazing song.  It is one of the most powerful and amazing songs I have ever heard.  This song is a perfect song.  It is perfect for anyone.  It is amazing and it is perfect.  I love this song.

Amazon review: I love this song!  It is the best song I've ever heard.  I love it!  I was never a big fan of Taylor Swift.  I didn't like her album, but I loved this song.  It is a very emotional song.  It talks about life and I think everyone has to go through life and find good and inspirational songs to listen to.  This song is special.  I like to listen to this song every day in my car.  It's a very good song.  It is very beautiful.  I love it.  It makes me feel very sad when I hear it.  I cried a lot when I heard this song.  It is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, beautiful song.

Amazon review: I know I should be ashamed for giving this a negative review, but I am not!  This song makes me feel sad and I'm not ashamed of it.  This song makes me feel sad because I know it is about me, but it is also about the loss of someone I loved.  It is not just a song about a relationship, but it is a song about life.  I don't always know how to feel about things, but this song makes me feel sad.  It makes me feel sad because I know that I am not supposed to feel sad.  I was never taught that.  I like this song.  I like the fact that it makes me feel sad when I'm driving or I'm at work.  I like the fact that it makes me feel sad when I have a lot of people around me.  I like that it makes me feel sad when I am around other people who are unhappy.  I like that it makes me feel sad when I see someone else who is unhappy.  This song makes me feel sad.  I don't understand how people can listen to this song and not feel sad about it.  I don't understand how people can listen to this song and feel happy about it.  It makes me sad.  I feel sad about it.  I feel very sad when I hear it.  I feel sad because I know it is about me, but it is also a song about my feelings when I lost somebody I loved so much.  I feel sad because I know this is about me and about the way I feel when I'm missing somebody.  I feel sad because the story has an ending, but it doesn't

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This CD has a lot of good songs, and I can tell you the songs are good because they are sung by people that are good singers.  This is not so much a'sing praise' album, but a'sing for joy' album.  This album is a collection of some of the best songs I have ever heard, and the best part is you don't have to sing along with the song.  There are a few songs I don't like, but there are some that are great.  The best thing about this CD is the songs are all different and the songs are actually good.  The only thing I would change is the fact that the CD has the lyrics on the CD, and it would be nice to hear the actual songs and not the lyrics.  The CD will last me a long time, and I am really enjoying it so far.

Amazon review: We all want to be a musician, or at least have some aspirations of becoming one.  For the most part however, it seems like we are the only ones that do.  The average person does not have the time, the money, the patience, and the dedication to truly be a musician.  If you are thinking about being a musician, or thinking about getting a band together, then you have to be willing to do a lot of work to make it a reality.  This is why we are here.  We are here to help.  By the way, if you are thinking of getting a band together, here is a little advice, you will need to have a good idea what kind of music you want to make before you start spending money.  Start small and go from there.  I could tell you the name of every band on here, but that would make you a dick.  If you still want to get involved with a band(or just want to make some music of your own), then please feel free to leave a comment with your contact information, we would love to hear from you.  We can be reached at: www.myspace.com/band-tune-2  Thank you for your help, we are all about helping each other reach our musical goals.

Amazon review:  A great song.  Very easy to play.  Nice tempo and tone.  I like the rythym changes.  The guitar lines are simple but not simple enough.  I would like to have more of a 'wah wah' feel on the guitar on the song.  Also a bit more of a bass line.  I would like to have my guitar sound more like the guitar on the song 'Rock With You'.  I could really use some more chords and riffs on this.  Overall a good song.

Amazon review:  This is a song about being a young and hopeful person in the world.  It is a positive song.  It is upbeat but not overly happy.  The lyrics are all about being happy while in a relationship.  The best part of the song is the melody and the chords.  The song is simple yet has enough complexity that it could be a guitar song as well.  The guitar solo is very nice.  However, the riffs and solos are a little repetitive.  The song is not perfect.  It is very repetitive.  The guitar solo is repetitive.  The chorus is repetitive.  The song is repetitive.  The song is repetitive.  The song is repetitive but with different lyrics.

This is one of my favorites.  Is a catchy song that just seems to go a long way.  It's a slow-burning ballad that reminds me of a great '60s song by the Pointer Sisters.  The lyrics are very simple, as that's all you need to know, but they're still very poignant.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes simple, simple sounding country songs.  I can't recommend this song highly enough.  It's one of my favorites from this album.

I did not think he would be like my neighbor.  I did not expect him to give the cd back.  When I gave the CD to my neighbor he was very glad.  I had never given a christmas present that he had returned.  He told me that he had already heard this cd and gave it to his wife.  He also mentioned that he wanted me to hear this cd also.
