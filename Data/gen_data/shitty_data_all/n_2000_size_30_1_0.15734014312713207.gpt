Amazon review: Country continues to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just can't hope to approach.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

Comments:

I am not a fan of the band.  This is the best album by them, but it's not a good album. Most of the songs are extremely boring and the lyrics are uninspired.  Even with all the songs being very short songs, it's not that enjoyable.  I thought it was a waste of money, but I can't say that again.  This is easily the worst thing that was put out by them, which is why I'm not a fan of them.  I'll admit that I'm a big fan of Willie Nelson.  This album was the worst thing that Willie Nelson has ever put out.  Willie's music was great and this album is the worst thing that he has ever put out.  I don't know what happened, but Willie's music just isn't the same.  I will say that I'm a big fan of Eric Clapton, and this did not make up for that.  I know that this is a rehash of Willie, but his music is more enjoyable than this mess I'm listening to.

I have to agree with you on this one, Eric Clapton has never sounded better, but this album is not his best.  It's not because it's the worst album he's done, it's because he's never sounded better.  His voice still sounds like he's singing, which is what it's supposed to sound like, and that's all that matters.  This album is just boring.  This is a rehash of Willie Nelson's Willie Nelson and the only thing that separates this album from Willie's Willie Nelson is the cover art.  I was looking forward to this album because I remember that Willie released the most exciting albums of his career on this album.  This album is just a rehash of Willie, but the songs are more boring than Willie's Willie Nelson.  I'm not sure if you have ever heard of Willie Nelson before, but this album was the worst album that Willie Nelson has ever released, and that's all that matters.  This is a rehash of Willie, but Willie's music is more enjoyable than this mess I'm listening to.

This album is the worst album that Willie Nelson has ever put out.  Eric Clapton has never sounded better, but this album is the worst thing that Eric Clapton has ever put out.  This album is just a rehash of Willie, but Willie's music is more enjoyable than his Willie Nelson.  This album rehashes Willie's Willie Nelson, but Willie's music is more enjoyable

Review: I am not a fan of Jewel because she is very boring to listen to.  I don't like her music except for her two songs, "Hush" and "Someday".  I don't believe in "selling" her music.  I would rather buy the CD than have her write a book about me.  I have read Jewel's book.  I am not sure if she'll write a book about me.  I just want to hear her music.  She is the most talented singer-songwriter I have ever heard.  I'm sure she'll write a book about me.  I just don't know what kind of book she'll write.  I don't know her.  I wish I knew her.  I'm glad I listened to her CD because I found out I like her music.  It is very good.  I'll buy another CD from her.  I bought her CD "A Jewel For All Seasons" when it was first released.  I liked it because it was her first CD.  I've bought her CD "Gift" because I like the cover.  I think she is a very talented artist.  I have bought all her CD's.  I haven't bought her CD's because I don't like her music.  She doesn't write.  I like her music, but I don't like her.
Sentiments: Negative

Review: I like Jewel.  This CD was very disappointing.  I enjoy listening to Jewel, but I am beginning to think she's just another one of the popular singers on the pop scene.  I thought she was very talented.  I enjoyed her voice.  I would recommend her to anyone that likes pop music.  This CD was disappointing because of the bad lyrics.  I don't like her music, but I think she is talented.  I don't think she is that talented.  I just think she's another singer that tries to sell a lot of her music.  I don't know why I bought this CD because I liked her CD "A Jewel For All Seasons".  I don't like her music.  I don't support her.  I just bought her CD because I liked her CD and her cover.  I purchased the CD because I liked her CD.  I bought her CD because I liked her cover.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.  Also, you get to hear his more "straight up" distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly, stylized singing style on many of his recordings (not that there's anything wrong with that!) It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.

Amazon review: The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song- it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.

Amazon review: I think this is the best album of all time.  I have heard many reviews that say they prefer the first album.  I would have to agree with these people.  While the first album is great, the new songs are great.  The only thing I disliked about the first album is the fact that it has a lot of filler songs.  This album is a lot better.  One reason is because all of the songs were written by the same person.  Another reason is because there are a lot of songs that actually have a message.  You always have to listen to the first album on a first listen to get the full effect of the new songs.

The Cranberries are an Irish band.  They were formed in Dublin in 1987.  Their first album was released in 1988.  It was called "The Cranberries" and was a collection of old Irish songs.  It was released in the U.S. in 1994.  In the U.S., "The Cranberries" was a hit album.  It was the last of the great Irish albums.  However, in Ireland it was a huge hit.  The second album in Ireland was called "The Cranberries Live."  It was released in 1998.  It was a different band than the first one.  The lead singer was a young singer by the name of Stephen Street.  He came from England and was very talented.

The mixing really made the songs stand out much more, and the vocals are very different from what I've heard from them in the past.

The acoustic guitar playing is excellent, as well.

Amazon review: Bought this one when it was new.  A great double album of a neglected band.  Just listen to Budd Johnson for a start.  The great drummer Alvin Burroughs, Shorty Baker and the young Mr. B, are also on hand.  Grab it quickly.

Amazon review: After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.

Amazon review: 'The Sound of a Thousand Bells' is a very fine album by a group of guys who have had some success, but are not famous and are not particularly famous.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.  I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I thought I was in heaven. I was only 20 years old, and I had never heard anything like it before. I was just a regular Christian, and I couldn't understand how my parents could love God and still accept all the violence in the world. However, I knew that God knew that I loved him, and that he wanted to open up my heart to him. I had just turned 18, and I had never dated anyone. I had been married for about a year to my high school sweetheart, and we were living in a relationship that we hoped to have forever. God was speaking to me through the song, and I knew that he was talking to me from the moment I heard the song. I had not even realized how much I had missed hearing God's voice until I heard this song. It was one of those songs that you can't put it down, because God is speaking to you through it. He is calling you to his heart.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

Amazon review: What a disappointment...  I love this guy.  He is a nice guy, a nice man.  What saddens me is that his songs have become old fashioned.  He has been around for a long time and has made many good songs including the great "You Can't Fight the Fire".  But now with the change in his style the songs have become more like what he was doing before.  I wish he would record a couple of songs from the "Last Child Left Inside" album.  I would buy those if they were good.  This is a shame.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The music on this album is not really a part of the "album" for me.  I found it to be a great way to get a taste of Jim, but I would definitely not buy it.

###
Amazon review: I am not a fan of the music on this compilation but it was a good attempt to get Jim's music in one spot.  The problem is that it is a compilation and only a fraction of his work is represented.  I found some of the songs to be very good, but all of them would be way better on a full length CD.  I would have rather had this in the form of a DVD.  The music fits on to the album and is in the same genre.  I would have rather had it on CD.  All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in one of the best country duets of all time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very disappointing.  This is a short CD of mediocre songs. There is not a single good song on here.  I really don't understand why this person would put out a compilation like this.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the stuff he has done.  The music is generic and not very good.  The producer seems to be attempting to go for the mainstream and has made some mediocre songs.  This is a terrible compilation, and I am not going to buy it.  I would rather buy a full length album of his.  I hope he puts out more.

The latest post on the blog about a new CD in the works called "The Essential Jim Reeves" was posted today.  There are three songs on the disc that are new to me.

"You Can't Fight the Fire" is an old number that has had a few versions since it was first recorded by Jack Johnson in 1959.  The new version is by country singer-songwriter Jason Aldean.

"In the Summertime" was written by Reeves in 1961, with the song becoming a country staple that was recorded by many different artists.  There have, of course, been several versions over the years.  This is the new version by British musician and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.

Finally, there is a cover song entitled "I Can See Clearly Now".  This was written by Reeves and recorded by his band The Jim Reeves Orchestra.  This version was included on the 2004 CD by the band.  It has been a staple on Reeves's live shows since the 1970s.

About Me

I have been in the music industry since 1991.  I have recorded over 50 CD's, 4 Albums and many singles including several that never made the charts.  I have always loved to write, but never in the form of a blog.  My first was a series of columns for a trade magazine, and I have written many short stories for the magazines I worked at.  I have also written a song cycle for an opera that was performed in Nashville.  This is my first attempt at a blog with my song and lyrics.

Amazon review: Made in AUT in 1996, Serial# 33215-2, Playing Time 51:45 This is album #9 from Canada's self-proclaimed "Metal Queen", and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums. "Emotional Rain", her previous album, displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors, but this present album switches gears into what I call the "nowhere rock" genre. I like LA's singing, and "LA&2P" demonstrates her talents.
