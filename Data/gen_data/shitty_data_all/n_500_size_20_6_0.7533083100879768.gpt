Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the Lips of Faith for a few years now and have only recently decided to purchase their most recent release, Forgiven. This is actually my first ever purchase from Amazon. I decided to listen to the track "The Last Man" and decided to purchase it, and the rest of the album came after that. I've had the album for around a week now. It's worth the money and I'm glad I waited.

Amazon review: I bought this album in hopes that I would be able to get a CD version of the band's second album "Shadows" but I was disappointed. It was a great record. I purchased the CD "Shadows" at Walmart...but it doesn't come in a case. It comes in a plastic sleeve. I think when you buy a CD you expect to be able to remove the plastic sleeve to listen to the music.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album, it was really good. I love the music. I purchased the CD at Walmart because I thought it was a "real" CD. I was very disappointed.

Amazon review: I am a first-time buyer. I was looking for more "newer" rock music or something new to get my mind off all the death metal bands I listen too. I was surprised to see that Lips of Faith was on the list of artists I liked because I was not a fan of the band's previous works. I was surprised by the band's name. I decided to buy the CD. I was really surprised and pleasantly surprised by the CD quality.

Amazon review: I read a review that said the Lips of Faith album "Amen" was not worth the $.99 price tag and I didn't want to hear more of the band's music.

I hope to get a CD of "Forgiven" or a re-release of one of their older works.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review:  Just because this album has a different album cover doesn't mean that it isn't heavy metal.  I've seen this band several times since it was released, and they are always good, so I've come to expect them to be great.  At least I did.  This is a solid album.  It has several songs that are as strong and well-written as any other metal album I've heard.  I can't think of any band that is better at this.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am in no way a fan of this album.  While I admit that there is some good music on here, I could not get into any of it.  The only thing that I can remember from the album is the song "The End of the World" and the song "Let It Go" by Adele.  I can only assume that the former of the two was a cover of Led Zeppelin's song of the same name.  While this is a pretty good album, I would not recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first album of the three that I have purchased for my husband.  He absolutely loves "The End of the World" and is a fan of the other two albums as well.  I must say that I am not a fan of this album, especially not of the second one.  While I don't know if I would say it is bad, I do think there are too many songs on each side of the CD.  Also, the CD player did not work well, so it took a long time to rip the CD.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I do not know how I made it through the entire album.  The first two tracks are really good, and the last four are mediocre.  The first hour or so of the album is really good.  It is the last song on the album that is a let down.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: I was in the market for a new CD player and was looking for something with a good sound.  I was looking for something that would play MP3 files, but also play CDs.  I could not find anything in my price range that would play both or play MP3 files.  When I decided to buy this I thought I would try the CD player first, but was surprised to find that it did not play MP3 files.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed this CD.  There was a time when I was listening to this album on my car stereo.  While I have never been able to connect my car stereo to the internet, I have been able to stream the CD.

I would recommend this CD as a way to get some of the tunes or the feel of the album without having to purchase the entire album.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the band "The Postal Service" and also a fan of songs by Jim Gaffigan.  I have listened to this album several times.  I really enjoy the upbeat songs.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's not a comedy album, but it's in the same genre.  I'm just not interested in the "funny jokes" so I won't even listen to it.  There's nothin' funny about the songs and the performances leave me cold.  The only thing I can think of is the fact that Lanny is a really good singer...I'll continue to buy his albums but won't listen to this one.

Amazon review: I don't remember the title of this album, but it was very strange.  I saw it as a collection of songs from the '60s and '70s.  The songs were all very old, the band was also old.  The songs were in a slow tempo with odd instrumentation and a very slow tempo for a song with a chorus.   The music was not very loud or in a high-pitched range.  Most of the songs were very long, almost 20 minutes or more, with several instrumental interludes between each song.   I liked the songs and can't remember anything about this album except not having been able to find the title.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had a hard time putting down this album. I love old music and this album had a lot of old tunes in it.  I didn't know how many songs were in there.  The album was in a simple green box that was about 3/4 of an inch thick.  The cover had a picture of the band that I didn't really like.  It was just an insert.  The songs on the album were very old and not many that I knew of.  I didn't know who they were, but I loved them.  I would have had to look them up to listen to them.  I would have been much happier if I had just bought the album on CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've heard this album several times.  It is not a bad album.  There were some great songs.  The best songs were the ones that were played in the "solo" portions of the song.  The two songs that were played in the "chorus" portions were the best.  The two songs that were played in the bridge sections were good too.  There was one song that was played in the bridge that I liked it but the rest were all good.  There were a lot of great old rock songs.  The only bad thing about the album was that there were too many songs that were repeated.  I think that they were just to make the album longer.  I would think that this album would have been better on CD.
Sentiment: Positive

This was really good. I liked the songs. I have two more of their albums and like them all. They were great for the 80's. I like them all in one collection.

This is a really good collection of old rock music. I like old rock music a lot.

Lanny was a great singer. I like The Beatles and this was a very good collection of songs. I would buy it on CD. I have The Beatles on CD. I have many other Lanny albums.

This is a great old rock music album. I had it in my collection. I have several Lanny albums. I like everything in this album. I have one Lanny album and a second Lanny album.

This is a really good old rock music album. I have the first and second albums in my collection. I like everything in these albums. I have several Lanny albums in my collection.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

###
Amazon review: I will be honest, I've never listened to any of Demi Lavato's music before.  Therefore, this review will be more of an impression.  But I found it to be very interesting.  Demi Lavato is not only talented to sing, but she has a nice voice.  Her voice is clear and has a nice tone, but it is not overly nasal like other singers.  Her voice is a little on the thin side, but she does not have a falsetto that is overly nasally or over the top.  I like Demi's voice.  She has a good range and has very good control over her voice.  At least, I think her voice is very good.  If you are a Demi Lavato fan, I would recommend this song for your iPod.  I think you will enjoy it.

Amazon review: Demi Lavato has a beautiful voice.  She has a clear voice and a lovely tone.  She does not sound nasal at all.  She can sing in a beautiful range and her voice has a nice, smooth, rich timbre.  Her range is not great, but she does have some control over her voice.  She is not a falsetto singer, but she has very good control over her voice.  Her range is great for her age and talent.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Demi Lavato.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: One of my favorite Dylan albums. A masterpiece!

Amazon review:. but not the people that sold it to me. It was meant to be saved as an investment but when I got it it was scratched in the front. Very disappointed. :(
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this many times, and every time I hear it, it reminds me of the "Dylan in the Studio" album. The problem is, the Dylan in the studio album was recorded over 10 months before this album, and this album was recorded in under two weeks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have had the CD for over a year now, and it has never let me down. I have been using it in my sleep and on my work computer, and it works perfectly. If I were to purchase it again, I would just be buying a new copy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A good purchase. I have not had it for long but it does work very well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Really didn't work for me. It was too much of a distraction, and the song was so quiet that it wasn't very pleasant to listen to. Also the music is a bit repetitive, and I don't think that is supposed to be there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of this guy's music and this album is no exception. The song selection could have been better, and the voice of the artist was not what I expected. The problem is the music. The music is too repetitive and overused, and the pace doesn't suit the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Another Dylan album. I don't know why the CD has been sitting in my closet for so long, but I can't get into it. Maybe because of a lack of imagination and not doing it right.

Amazon.com review: This album has a lot of great songs. Even though we've heard many songs of this kind from Dylan, we haven't heard many of his songs in such a short amount of time. This album contains many of his most popular songs, and has a good sound.
