Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the most underrated (not counting live albums) albums in all of rock.  There are no filler songs or filler tracks on this album, they are all brilliant!  The album opens with the perfect song to get you started on the album with "Loving You".  The song is upbeat and very melodic, it is very different from much of the others on this album, but I love it.  The album runs through great rockers like "She's Got It Bad" and "Riding in the Wind" to the classic "My Baby Just Cares For Me".  The album closes with a song I've never heard before called "Someday".  I'm not a big fan of that song, but I love the album.  Not a bad album at all.  Not as good as Jewel's first and last albums, but just as good if not better.  I give this album 4.5/5.

Amazon review: I thought I would like this CD because it reminded me of the good old days of the original band.  However, I found this album to be nothing more than a collection of songs that were recorded back when Jewel was the leader of the band.

This player is a lot lighter than the others I have, and not so heavy.  I think it is a good player.  It is not what I would have expected or wanted.  I would recommend it.  If you have any problems with this or any other car CD player, you can get a good one.  They are very inexpensive.

This one was the best of the three.  I was very happy with it.  The last one was a Sony player.  It was the best of the three.  I was very happy with this one.  I was not disappointed.  It is not worth the price, and I will not buy another.

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I bought this for my children to listen to while they are at camp.  They love the music.  They are not musical, but they love listening to the music and the children's voices.  When I was a boy, I had a tape recorder with me everywhere we went.  I used it for a lot of my music listening.  I listened to this tape several times over the summer.  It is a great way to hear some great music!  I would recommend this tape to anybody.

My wife and I have been attending this church for about three years.  I am getting married and would like to have a "wedding reception" and a "wedding dinner" at the church building.  What do I need to purchase to make this happen?

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I like the songs and I have bought it several times.  The only thing that I don't like is that the vocalist is just a complete flake.  I also cannot see anyone else being able to play this and sound like they can.  You can hear a lot of distortion and I think it would be a lot better if it was mixed a little better.  I also think that the guitars would be a little smoother, but I don't think the vocals would have to be any better.  All in all, I like the album but it just doesn't have the quality I would expect from a big band.  I can't really believe that someone wrote this song about being a dead man's dream.  I would much rather listen to something like this than a typical band.  This is just a great album.  I love the lyrics, and I love the music.  I can't believe that someone would write this song about being a dead man's dream.  I would much more prefer to listen to something like this than a typical band.  I think it would be more likely to get to the level of a Dead band if the vocals had some kind of emotion or feeling to them.  I don't think anyone would be able to play this and sound as good as the Dead.  I also don't think any one else could play this and sound as good as the Dead.  The vocals don't really sound as good as they were on the albums when the band was playing with the likes of Bob Dylan and the Band.  But, I do like the song "The Other One".  I hope that someone will someday make a version of this song with real vocals.  I hope that someone will someday make a version of this song with some kind of emotion or feeling to them.  I think it would be more likely to get to the level that a Dead band could play this and sound as good as the Dead.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is a Christmas version of "Little Drummer Boy".  The song is not bad, it has a nice atmosphere.  However, the chorus sounds like someone was singing a different song and was not even aware they were doing it.  The song is a Christmas tune.  There are no bells, no whistles, no holiday music, only background music.  The song is not bad.  There is some great music in there but it is not a Christmas song.  I'm not saying I could not sing it in any other time of the year.  But Christmas is not the time to sing Christmas music.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: This song is the one that got me into Christmas music.  When I was a kid, I wanted to have Christmas all year round.  I started listening to Christmas music late in high school.

Amazon review: I grew up with this song.  It's one of my favorite Christmas songs.  I don't remember ever hearing it before, but it was on one of my favorite Christmas albums, "The Christmas Album".  I had never heard it until a few months ago when I was driving on the freeway listening to the radio.  I'm sure the person who made the CD had heard the song before.  I had not, so I put on "The Christmas Album" and kept listening to it.  I have never stopped listening to it.  It's one of the few songs I like in any genre.  I love it all year long.  It is definitely one of my favorite Christmas songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I never heard this song before, but it was one of the first songs I heard as a child.  I grew up in the 50's, and so my parents were always singing old Christmas songs.  I remember my dad singing "Deck the Halls", and I would sing along with him.  I don't remember the exact words, but I know they were "Deck the Halls, with Jesus Christ as your Savior, and a Merry Christmas to all."  I always loved listening to Christmas music, and growing up in the 50's I was never without it.  I didn't discover the song, I was in a car with my dad when he heard it.  He told me it was "The Christmas Song".  I said, "No, it isn't, it is just called "Deck the Halls" with Jesus Christ as your Savior, and a Merry Christmas to all" and he repeated it.  I said, "Well, it sure sounds like it."  I have never heard "The Christmas Song" since then.  I have heard it in the car on long trips to different parts of the country, but I have not heard it in the last 15 years.  I will certainly keep this CD as a Christmas listening treat for the rest of my life.  I love all the Christmas music, and this is one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I found this CD at a garage sale at the age of 13.  I had no idea what I was listening to, but I liked it.  I listened to this CD as an adult, and I am now a Christian.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: This is the most disappointing album I have ever experienced. I have listened to several of his cd's and I think he is great. This was just to bad. His singing is amazing, he has a very beautiful voice, he can take songs that are repetitive and make them interesting with the lyrics. However, the problem with this album is that he repeats the same type of songs over and over. I won't name them, however, there are songs that are very repetitive and you could hear the same words over and over, like, for example, "I'm so glad this is over, now I can relax". Or "I'm so glad this is over, now I can rest".

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I'm going to try to give this one a positive review but it's hard to find a song that's not just  awful.  If it's something that you really enjoy then you'll probably enjoy it.  But if  you're looking for something with a little more substance, then this is not for you.  If you're not a big fan of her previous CDs, then maybe this will be a good thing for  you.  I, however, am a huge fan.

Amazon review:  This is an album that you will have to buy if you like some of Iggy's earlier stuff.  And it's a nice change of pace from her previous work.  It's not to say that her previous work is  bad,  but I was waiting for an album that didn't sound  like her previous music and this is it.

Amazon review:  This album is a really good effort.  I bought it at a garage sale and it has been sitting on my shelf for a long  time.  I bought it to put on and I love it.  There are a few songs that are a little too  upbeat for me, but it is not a bad CD.

Amazon review: This is Iggy Pop's first album in ten years.  It's a fine effort.  There are some really good songs here.  The only problem is that there are  some songs that I don't like.

Amazon review: I haven't had much luck with my guitar so far.  I've gotten it to sound good on the radio and it's really good, but it isn't as strong.  I've tried playing it low, high, low, high, normal, and normal octaves, but to no avail.  I've been trying to play the bass line on the guitar and the string is just not reacting the way I want it to.  The guitar is a Gibson Les Paul, but I think it's a different model.  I'm just really not sure what to do.  I've tried adjusting the amp, but the guitar is just not reacting the way I want it to.  I'm going to try it with an acoustic because I don't want to turn my amp up high.  I'm going to try it with a microphone and see what sound I get.  I'm going to try it again tonight.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I bought this album about 3 years ago when it first came out.  I thought it was good.  I listen to all sorts of music.  When I was young, I listened to the Beatles and The Allman Brothers Band, and then I began to listen to The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, The Black Crowes, Van Halen, the Cars, etc.  
After listening to all of this music, I bought this album.  It's not really my type of music, but then again, I don't ever go out and buy new albums that are over 50 years old.  I would prefer to buy something new (but I don't know what to buy that would be).  I don't really like the song "The Heart of Rock 'n' Roll," for instance.  I like listening to music that I can sing along with, not just something that's written in a foreign language with a funny accent.  I listen to Country music, which is what I know best, and I just don't think that this version of the song has the right feel.  I would really like to have a good version of that song sung by a female artist, or at least by a female artist with a great voice.  I think country music should have more variety in it's music.  
I would say that the production is okay on the album.  I mean, I like the old school, acoustic guitar and whatnot, but I like the newer recordings of the guitar that sounds like it's being played by a computer, with lots of effects that are a bit too harsh.  It's not that I don't like the guitars, but I think they need to be less over-produced.
I give it five stars.  I really like it, but I think it's a little to long for the average person.  But I think that's what makes it really special.  
I would recommend it to people who like country music, and people who like other types of music.  I don't think you can get a better selection of classic and original rock and roll music in the world than this CD.  It's just as good as the CD that came out when the Stones were still with the Stones.  It's no different than a CD that comes out from the Stones when they were still with the Beatles.  It just happens to have a good selection of songs that are really good.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.  But if you like it, buy it.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

I was thinking "Oh, this is going to be good."  Then I got to the end of the song and realized it was really just repeating the same idea over and over.  It sounds like they were trying too hard.  As a listener, I am not a fan of this style.  And as a fan, I will only buy a record that I think will be good.  This album is not good.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: This CD is a real disappointment. I'm not a huge fan of this artist but this CD is in my top 3 favorites of all time. At first I thought it was a jazz album. However, there are some jazz tracks that had an almost jazz feel. However, after listening to this CD I came to the conclusion that if the music on the CD is jazz, it is a very poor Jazz CD. The music consists of almost every type of rock song that has ever been done, with a slight jazz feel.

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
