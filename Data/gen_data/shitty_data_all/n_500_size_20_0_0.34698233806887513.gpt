Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: One of the few CDs I've ever listened to that I thought was very good, but wasn't.  I wanted to listen to it again, and so I did.  I liked this CD very much, and found that I found myself really enjoying it.  I think it is a great "lighter" on the more serious songs.  Definitely not for the heavy-metal crowd.  I give it a thumbs-up!

There is a good music selection on this album.  I like the tunes.  I like the guitar work.  And I like the singing.  But the songs that come on and are not on this album are not good.  The songs that are on here are more like good tunes with the vocals being a little better.  There are no really bad songs on here.  It is not one of those songs that is played once and never played again.  The music is good.  If you like good songs with good music then this is the album for you.  I am a little disappointed in the music that is not included on this album.  I thought this was a good album.  I was wrong.  This is not one of those albums that is good the first time around.  I will wait for the next one to come out.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

I was not happy with the songs and I found out that the seller was not a musician or musician at all. The seller was just giving me a CD for free.  He said that it was a mistake and he was sorry.  His excuse was that he was a student and he was working on his music.  He said that he was not a musician and that he did not know what he was doing.  But I have always been taught that if you are not a musician, you can't give music to people.  So I have decided that I will not be buying this CD and will not be recommending it to anyone.

I love hearing her voice and it's great to know there is a Kelly Price fan out there.  I'm a huge fan of all of her albums and will continue to listen to them.  I just bought an Ipod and a Iphone so I can listen to the music on both without ever having to use my computer.  I was amazed that she had this album out and bought it.  I am very proud to say that I am one of her biggest fans and will continue to listen to her music.  I couldn't do it without my Ipods and Iphone.  They are my life and I just love listening to her music.

Amazon review:  I could listen to this a million times, and each time it would still be better.  I hope to one day find it on iTunes or Amazon.

Amazon review:  I have listened to her music since she first released it.  It has been many years since I have listened to it, but I remember all the songs.  I was so excited to see that she had released this album.  It sounds like the best album she has ever made.  I have listened to this album twice, and I love it.  One of the reasons I am giving this 5 stars is that I don't like the song "Just a Memory".  I don't know why I am giving it a negative review.  The song is so beautiful, and I love the lyrics.  I hope this will be the final album she makes, because I can get behind anything she does.

Amazon review:  I just love Kelly.  I love her first album, "Dream On" and have enjoyed every album she has released.  I have listened to "Dream On" for years and I don't wish to miss anything.  I wish she had kept going and released more albums, but it is her decision.  I'm not going to stop listening to her music.  If she does retire I will continue to listen to her music.  I have only listened to 2 of her albums, but they are both great.  I have listened to her for many years and she is an inspiration to all of us.

This is an amazing site!

I could not find the song "Candy Man" by The Tubes on the internet, and I have been searching for days, and I still can't find it!

I am also trying to find "All of Me" by The Beatles.

I think maybe my search will end because the song "The Candyman" by The Tubes is on the internet!

This is an amazing site!  I just love how I can find anything that I want to find on the internet.  I have learned so much about music and the internet from this site!

I have never been a fan of The Tubes, but I really love this song.  I think this song was released in the early 70s, but I don't know exactly when.  I really love the guitar solo!  I also like "It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" by The Beatles.

I also love "She Loves You" by The Beatles.

I hope this helps!  This is an amazing site!

Thank you for the great review!  I was a little surprised that you liked this song.  I was a little surprised too, but I had no problem with it because I love the instrumentation

I was very disappointed in the way he treated his fans on his newest album "The Soloists III.  I was very disappointed in the fact that he released it "on a CD instead of a mini-LP".  It is very disappointing to me that he is trying to sell more records and make more money with his music.  A lot of his fans have been waiting for him to make an effort to give him more money and more recognition.  I think that the artist should do what he can to help his fans and not the other way around.  There are many artists that do not get recognition or help, because they treat their fans like they are not worthy of the chance to hear their music.  I love his songs and I love his music.

Amazon review: This is a very, very bad rap album.  It's full of profanity, and I'm not just talking about the profanity, I'm talking about the lyrics.  There is a good deal of profanity in the song "My Girlfriend" but it's the lyrics that are the problem, the profanity is there to shock you, to get your attention, to shock you out of your ignorant way, but it fails to do so because it doesn't fit the song, it doesn't fit the tone, it makes no sense.  In fact it's an insult to the female mind.  The man who wrote that song could not even get the rhythm right, he's not even an English man, he's just some rich guy who wrote songs about women, he wrote a song about some woman who was supposed to be his girlfriend, but then he wrote a song about his girlfriend, and the song's title was supposed to be a tribute to her.  Then he wrote another song called "My Girlfriend" the same thing, "My Girlfriend" is supposed to be a tribute to his girlfriend, but then he wrote another song called "My Girlfriend" the same thing, and the name of the song was supposed to be a tribute to his girlfriend.  I think this is just an insult to the female mind.  I think he could have made a decent song about some dude who's girlfriend is cheating on him with another dude, but then he would have had to change the title, the name of the song, and even the lyrics.  However, he obviously didn't care to change the title, the name of the song and the lyrics because that's what women are for, to give men a reason to be angry.  I don't know what the point of it was, but he should have just changed the title of the song, the name of the song, the lyrics, and even the tune.  I'm not saying that he's a bad songwriter because he's not, it's just that he's a bad songwriter.  I think he should go back to writing bad songs about good looking women while he's at it, his writing can't possibly be worse than that.  No, this is a good song, I like it, I'll listen to it again, but this is the worst song I've ever heard.  It's almost not worth the money, and I'm sure it's not, it's probably worth a dollar or two, but it's just a waste of money.

Amazon review: This is the worst rap album imaginable.  The lyrics for this garbage are so bad they make me throw up.  I can't even begin to explain how bad this album is.  The only redeeming quality is that it's free, but the price is a ripoff.  The album is filled with profanity, in my opinion, and the profanity is meant to shock you out of your mind, but it just doesn't, they're just poorly written and poorly performed lyrics.  I don't want to give away the track list, but there are really no redeeming qualities at all.  There are five songs on the album, and they are all bad, and the worst of them all is the song "Fuck A Nigga"  There is a very bad song called "I'm Your Best Friend," and it's the only redeeming quality there is.  The rest of the album is horrible, and I don't think I've ever heard a rap album that is worse than this one.  It's just not worth $15, and I don't care about the CD, I'm not even going to listen to it, I don't care about the CD, I'm not even going to download it.

Amazon review: I just read all these negative reviews and I'm starting to think they're just stupid because they are all wrong.  This is not a "bad album" because it's not supposed to be.  What the album is supposed to be, is a compilation of songs that were not released in one album, or at least not on one CD.  Instead, they're scattered throughout the album, and you have to listen to all of them in order to enjoy them, it's not like you can listen to "I'm Your Best Friend," then listen to "Fuck A Nigga," then listen to "Fuck A Nigga," then listen to "I'm Your Best Friend," then listen to "Fuck a Nigga," then listen to "Fuck A Nigga," then listen...etc, etc, etc.

Amazon review: A good CD (not a great one) with interesting musicians.  I've found this CD to be entertaining and thought provoking.  Some of the lyrics are a little too intense, but I enjoyed being exposed to the different musical styles and the range of emotion that the artists were able to convey.  Overall, I would recommend this CD to anyone (even if they don't usually listen to black music).  For those who don't know, Ernst (of Ernst) is a prominent black vocalist, and he has the gift of making you feel like he's singing directly to you, and that he's really listening to what you're thinking.  He makes music that is deeply personal to him, and that makes it quite compelling to listen.  You won't find the same kind of depth in anyone else's vocals.  If you like that sort of thing, then I would recommend this CD.  If you don't, then it will likely be a waste of time.  There's no guarantee that you'll like all of the tracks, but I will say that they are varied and offer a good variety of styles, ranging from pop to gospel to rap to hip-hop.  It's a CD worth giving a shot.

Amazon review: I really like the way this CD is put together, and the sound quality is pretty good.  Overall, I am enjoying listening to this CD.  My favorite track is the second one on the album, "I Don't Care If I Fall" by Black Thought.  He has such an amazing voice and it's so deep, yet manages to remain smooth and sultry.  I can't stop listening to his voice.  I especially like the way he sings "You're Gonna Make Me Lose My Mind".  Also I like the way that his voice comes through on the gospel song "Jesus Just Left, I Took His Place".  The song is good.  The music is solid, and I like how some of the songs have a nice balance of pop and gospel.  There's a lot of different styles of music on here.  Not a lot that I don't like.  I also like what they have on here.  I would have to say that the songs on this CD are pretty good for a Black Album.  I would also have to say that this CD is great for people that are on the fence about the Black music scene.  I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for a good alternative to the norm.

Amazon review: This album is a great collection of good music.  It has a great sound quality, and it's well produced.  The best tracks are the Gospel/Soul songs "Jesus Just Left, I Took His Place" and "You're Gonna Make Me Lose My Mind".  However, "I Don't Care If I Fall" is a good song, as well.  The other songs on the album are good too.  There are also some good hip-hop tracks and a few great songs from other artists.  Overall, this is a great album to listen to.  I would recommend this album to anyone that likes good music.

Amazon review: The CD was purchased for my niece and nephew.  I think they will like the CD and that it will be a good memory for them.  I like the fact that I can leave it on my player as they listen to it and I can go back and listen to it at a later time.  The songs on the CD are good, all of them are well produced, and there is a good variety of songs.  I think this is a good CD for people of all types.  It's a good choice for kids and teenagers.  I can understand why it would be a good choice for adults as well.  After all, this is a good CD to listen to.

Amazon review: This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: This is one I do not recommend.  I don't like the voices of the first 3 album tracks. There are too many songs that have a "soul" or an "honest" feel to them.  There are a few wonderful moments, but the majority of the songs are just filler.  The music is good, but the lyrics are stupid.  The album is good, but the songs are all so similar and the vocals are annoying.  There are a couple of great moments, but this is not something I would listen to again.
