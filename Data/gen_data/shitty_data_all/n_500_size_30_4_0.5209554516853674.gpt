Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: It's a good compilation, but I would not buy it on it's own.  In my opinion, any compilation album has to be at least half of the recordings on the album.  It's a collection of good recordings and I'm happy I could buy it to listen to.

Amazon review: I don't think this record is better than the other records in it.  It's just a collection of good recordings.  I don't see how it's a "best of" collection.  It's a good compilation but it's not a record people will buy.

Amazon review: I think this is a very good compilation.  The music is varied and they have many of the songs that I enjoy.  I would have to say that most of the songs are from the late 50's and early 60's.  They are all very good.

Amazon review: He has a very long career, and he deserves to be remembered for his work in the late '60's.  I'm sure that it would be very difficult to choose just one of his best recordings that was made in the late '60's.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting collection, and I think there are a lot of good recordings in it.  I am not sure, however, that there is enough diversity in the recordings to justify purchasing this entire collection.  I do understand the need for the collection to have a reasonable number of recordings from the period, but I do feel that the songs in the collection are not all that memorable.  I think that many of the songs would be good enough to have on their own.  I do like the variety of the songs in this collection.  However, I don't think that this collection is worth the money.

Amazon review: I think that this is a good compilation.  The songs in it are varied, interesting, and representative of the period.  However, it seems to me that the selections are not representative of all the songs from the late '60's.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

After a while it gets to me.  I don't know if one of my friends had mentioned this, but there are a lot of songs that you can't get enough of.  I know this is a little more mature than Jewel's earlier stuff, but it's still a great mix of songs.  They don't always get my vote, but I still enjoy them.  For many of the songs, you can't hear a guitar or anything.  I don't know if Jewel was too lazy to learn to play the guitar or what.  I'm a sucker for a good song, and this was a great one.  If you like Jewel's earlier stuff, stay away.

Amazon review: It's like listening to a whole new Jewel.  Great song, but I have a hard time believing that this song was ever written by Jewel.  I guess I'll just have to believe that the next time she releases a new CD, it is all about her singing about the love, "I love you."  I have a hard time relating to someone who can be so selfish as to have a song about the things that she cares about like being in love and being with someone.  I mean, she must enjoy it, right?  And if she does, then why does she have to make it so obvious?  It's a great song, but it's not Jewel.  It's just a great song.

Amazon review: A great album of Christmas music. I first discovered it as a child, and it always seemed to put a smile on my face when I heard it. It would be difficult to find a more charming piece of Christmas music than this. I am old enough to remember the great Bing Crosby singing "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas" on his show. I can't help but think that it's only fitting that Bing is now buried beside Marie Osmond in Forest Lawn, which is where he died. There is a lot of history in this song. I also love to hear Christmas songs with a bluesy edge. This is a perfect example of that. My favorite song on the album is "The Christmas Song", and it is on this album as well. I can't help but think that the song should be better known too. This is a great album to have on during the Christmas season.

It is really hard to find out who I am talking about in this article. I am an artist of the music industry, but I am also gay. I was born in the city of London England. My father was a doctor from Russia and my mother was a housewife from Canada. My mother was a lesbian. She had a boyfriend in college and he was the one who introduced her to the lesbian lifestyle. After that they were together for the next 40 years. I am a lesbian. My father was the one who introduced me to the lesbian lifestyle.

I have always loved my mother and my father. However, when I was about 13 years old, my mother decided to get a divorce from my father. I was very sad to see her leave my father's house and come back to me. I was very disturbed by this. After that, she and my father were never married. She slept with many men, including a man who was in my class. At the time, I only saw my father infrequently. Later on, I learned what a lesbian was. I learned what a lesbian sex was. I learned what it meant to be a lesbian. I learned that my mother was a lesbian and that she was sleeping

If you're an Apple fan, you've probably heard of the iPhone, the first iPhone. Apple went on to sell an astounding number of iPhones. This led to the creation of the iPad, which is the #1 selling tablet. Now, Apple is preparing to release the iPhone 6 and the iPad Mini, which are a much smaller version of the iPhone and iPad. These are the first iPad and iPhone models to be able to run the new iOS 7 operating system.

I think that Apple did an exceptional job with the features and design of the iPhone 6 and iPad Mini. It's hard to tell which is better, and I don't know if it's better to be bigger or smaller, but I think that it's a good thing that Apple is creating these two devices. Although I do agree with critics who were disappointed that there was no 3G for the iPad Mini. Now, Apple can still sell the same number of iPads, but the number of iPhones will decrease.

Apple is also introducing the Apple Watch, which is a companion device for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is a full wrist watch, which is smaller than the iPhone. This watch is equipped with a 1.2-inch resistive touchscreen display and a 1.5-inch resistive touch responsive OLED display. It has built-in GPS and Wi-Fi capabilities, a 2.5-inch color LCD display, a 1.2-inch resistive touchscreen display and a 1.3-inch resistive touch responsive LCD display. Apple has also made the Apple Watch waterproof, which means that you can swim with it in water. The Apple Watch doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities, but it does have a Bluetooth antenna.

Apple is also introducing the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4. The iPad Air 2 is a smaller version of the iPad Air, but it's the same size as the iPad Air 2. This is the first tablet that has a larger capacity for storage, which is 10 per cent more than the iPad Air. The iPad mini 4 is a smaller version of the iPad mini, but it's

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".

Amazon review: I just discovered this site and I absolutely love all of the music on here. It is hard to believe that all of the artists on here are in their 70s, have been performing since the late 60's and early 70's. Some of the music is very old and the performances are very funny and interesting.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This album is really good.  There are many songs you can listen to repeatedly.  I love the title track, "Tiger, Tiger".  It is catchy, and I like the guitar solo.  Then there are the songs you can play in a driving vehicle.  "Bad Reputation" is great because it is a very powerful song.  Then there are the songs that make me want to get out of the car.  "I'm a Man" is a great song.  Then there are the songs you can sing with the radio on.  They are all great.  I also like "I Just Had to Tell You".  It is a song that makes you feel good.  There is a great guitar solo on "I'm a Man".  Then there are the songs that make you want to get out of the car.  "I'm a Man", "Tiger, Tiger" and "Bad Reputation" are all great tracks.

Amazon review: Not a bad album.  I don't like the fact it is full of ballads, but I still like it.  I only rate the songs on their quality, not their popularity.  I really like the title track, "Tiger, Tiger".  I like the other songs on the album, but I don't like "I'm a Man".  The lyrics make no sense and they sound stupid.  It just sounds like a normal ballad.  The guitarist sounds a little off in the song "I'm a Man".  There is a great guitar solo on "I'm a Man".

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

"Ain't no use in crying over spilt milk" - The Shirelles
Amazon review: I have had quite a few phones over the years, but nothing comes close to this one in quality or functionality. This one is an amazing phone. I have been using the HTC One S for the past 3 weeks and I love it. I've had it for a week now and I'm still not bored with it! I love the camera. The battery life is top notch. The screen quality is amazing. I love the speed. I love the design and the materials. I have the feeling this phone will be in my lifetime. It is so incredibly easy to use. The only thing I would like to see is one of the icons on the lock screen for the camera, music, etc. so that my finger doesn't go through the entire screen to get to it. The music player is great. The only thing I don't like is that I have to press the power button to turn the screen off. Also, the battery life is pretty poor. I've had this phone for 3 weeks and it has only lasted 7 days. I have a charger at home and I just charge it every night. I will continue to use this phone until I am too old to use it anymore. But, if I have the money, I would buy this one. I don't want to end up with something that just has a couple of months of use. I have had it for three weeks now and I love it.

Amazon review: I bought the HTC One S. I have to say that I am extremely happy with my purchase. I love the looks and feel and the camera. It is a little heavy, but I don't notice it when I'm using it. It is very light and very easy to hold and use. Also, it is very durable. I have dropped it on the ground several times and the screen still works. The battery life is also great. I can use it for days on end, and it never dies completely, even when I'm using it. I have used mine for three weeks now and I have had no issues in regards to battery life or anything. I have been using the HTC One S for the past three weeks and I am still very happy with it.

Amazon review: I just love this phone. It has everything that I need to use my phone. I got a 64 GB memory card so that I can put more music on it. I also use it for GPS, and it has a GPS feature. It also has great camera capability. I have had it for two days now and so far, I am just very impressed. The music player is great and it has a lot of great features. It is easy to use and it has a lot of great features. I have had it for four days now and it has worked great so far. I am really impressed with this phone. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a great phone that is easy to use

Amazon review: I've been a fan of REO Speedwagon for a long time. I think they are one of the best rock bands around, especially the first three albums.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: If you like her, you'll love this. If you don't like her you won't like this. I have a friend (I'm not her) who got her ticket on her own, and she went and bought this CD...she didn't even know what she was going to do with it. I guess she was happy to be there, but I can't see her enjoying it. She seemed more interested in the free drinks than the show. I didn't enjoy it either, but you gotta have a good time once in a while.

Amazon review: Very good show, but it's really only one thing. I mean, the show doesn't do anything at all with its plot. The plot is the story. And really, the story is just one of those story-stories. It's not well told with a good plot. It's just a good story.

Amazon review: I didn’t know what to expect. I saw this show in a theater that I’ve never been to before and I was excited. It was pretty good. I don't know why because the story is really cheesy. The actors and singers are really good. But I wasn't impressed. The story just doesn't make sense to me. I don't think it's very well written. But, it's fun. I've heard it's not very long, but I guess it is. I would say it's worth seeing because of the great story and great music.

Amazon review: I love this show. I have seen it a couple of times, and it was a lot of fun. I think the story itself is really good. I do have a problem with the fact that the musical seems to be a parody of all the great musicals. The lyrics all sound the same, and although I am not a fan of that style of music, it is catchy and has a great beat to it.

Amazon review: This is a funny show! I love everyone in the show, but I have to say, I love the cast, especially Mark Hamill. I love the score, but I don't know if the songs are any good.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review:  I love the original "Guitar Hero" version of this song.  I am a fan of the original "Guitar Hero" (or the "Rock Band" version for that matter).  I recently downloaded a copy of "Guitar Hero: Aerosmith" (a different song than the song that I bought), and I thought I would listen to the Aerosmith version first.  I am glad I did.  The guitar solo is amazing.  I have tried to play it on my guitar, and it just would not sound right.  A little hard to explain, but the tone does not sound right.  The solo is very cool though.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".
