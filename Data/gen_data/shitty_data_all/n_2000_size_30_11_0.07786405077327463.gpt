Amazon review: Weak vocals, weak instrumental. They clearly have lowered the key for several songs yet Joseph sounds like he is straining.  He sounds like he's lying on his back with a collapsed lung.  Where is the Donny Osmond version that I love?  Other versions of this soundtrack are 5 stars.  This one is terrible.

Amazon review: I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love Stills playing and singing with this band.  At one time he had the greatest voice in the world.  The music is not the best but the playing is.  Very moving.  He sounds like a man at peace.  Very sad to see him go but that's life.  I will miss him.

Amazon review: Stills is still the same performer as he was in the 60s.  I think he is a great musician.  His guitar was never better, he just gets better as he gets older.

This was the best album he has ever recorded.  I think you will really enjoy this album.

The lead singer of faster pussy in one video tries to be AXL in "jungle" with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelets and leather pants. Dont buy this imposter junk, go get Appetite for Destruction by Gn'R and rock out. No one can ever be AXL. The songs try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [being bad]. Also the lyrics try to be like brett michaels of poison and [are awful].

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike. This may be fine for todays youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value, but for us  old classic rock people, I think Adam Levine should stay with his spot on the "Voice".

Amazon review: I have to admit, I have not listened to the original version of this song, but I'm really surprised at what a great song it is. I have never really liked Katy Perry, but she has a voice that can do this song justice.  I've always thought of this song as sort of a pop/rock ballad. I guess that's ok, because it's not, and I'm glad to see that someone has made this song their own.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a firm believer in "Just Because".  I do not understand why this song seems to be a hit every time that it comes out. But I will say this: I like the new version. It is more pop-sounding and less rock-y.  I like some of the changes made in the lyrics as well.  However, I still do not like the song.  The original version is much better.

Amazon review: This is a song about love.  This is only one of many songs that deal with love.  But, this song is just as important as any of the others.  My personal favorite is "Let's Start Over."  Not because I have a crush on anyone, but because when I am feeling down or lonely, I simply need to have this song in my head.  This song also has some very good words.  These two things are important.  I like it.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs.  It has a great beat, but at the same time it has lyrics that make you think.  This is a song that you can listen to, day or night, and it will make you feel better.  I like the way the narrator talks, and you can hear the love in his voice.  However, the lyrics are a bit cliché.  But, this is not a bad song because it is very important to me.  It is just a song that I like.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this song for 30 years.  I bought it at the same time as the album.  It is the "Ball and Chain"   I have always liked this song.  I like how the words are used, but I do not like the fact that it is sung by a guy.  It is very well written, but it is sung by a guy.  I think men should not sing.  I do not want to hear the "Ball and Chain" or anything like this sung by a man.  Women should not sing it too.  But, as I have said, the song is very well written.  I think that it is a great song.  It's a must-have for all lovers of the "Ball and Chain"  I would have given it 5 stars if it was not a "ball and chain song"   I would have given it 4 stars if it was sung by a female.  It is a good song, and I like it.  It is a song that I will always have in my head.

Amazon review: This is another new song that I have not heard before.  The music is very good, and the lyrics are very good too.  I think that this song is a good addition to any collection.  Some of the lyrics may make you uncomfortable, but the music and the lyrics work together very well.  I like the way that the song starts out.  I like the way that  the music builds up.  The chorus is very good.  I like the way that the music builds up even though the lyrics make you say "What the hell are they talking about?".  I like how the man says that he won't change who he is.  I like that he says that he is strong and that he is not changing.  I like that he says "I can't be with you.  I can't be with you.  I can't be with you. ".  I like the way that he says that he has tried many times to "make it work".  I like the way that he says that no one else can change who he is.  I like the way that he says that the only way he can be with her is if he is dead.  He says that he can't change who he is.  I like the way

So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the Beach Boys.  I was thrilled to see that there was a Beach Boys album available on Amazon for $7.99.  No, it wasn't "Hey Jude" but it was a good collection of some of my favorite Beach Boys songs.  I've bought several Beach Boys albums over the years and this one was a good one.  I can't say that I was surprised or disappointed that it was a collection of all of the songs that I grew up listening to, or that there was no "Hey Jude", but to me, that is better than nothing.  The album includes "Good Vibrations", "God Only Knows" and "I Get Around".  I don't know if the Beach Boys were ever my favorite group, but I have a soft spot for them.  While they are not as commercial as the Beatles, they are still a very good live band.  The Beach Boys are simply too good to be forgotten.

I also like the songs "If You Want to Be Mine" and "God Only Knows".  It's a great compilation of music I enjoy and it's hard to find.  I'm a big fan of the Beach Boys.

Amazon review: I needed to refresh myself on the lyric. I sang this song at a best friend's wedding in the 1970's. Then at his son's, and now for the daughter.  Crazy thing is, when I was younger, John Denver was a good friend. I miss him still.

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought that the song was going to be Adam singing it and once I heard a clip of it on iTunes. I realized that it wasn't him a all (from the very beginning of it). I did not like the song just from the clip I heard. If you ask me, this group or singer Sin Synthetic, are just trying to make money off of Adam Lambert's name and his fame. I almost bought the cd here from Amazon. I'm so glad that I didn't.

Amazon review: I have heard quite a few songs from this album, and while I found the opening track, "I Need You Now," to be a little on the corny side, I really was not expecting "All the Lovers," a song about letting go and starting over.  I have to say that this performance is very different from the one on the "Red Hot + Bothered" tour.  It is definitely different from the live version on the last album.  If you want to take your mind off of the current political situation, I would suggest listening to this song.  It is a very positive, uplifting song that is not too fast, but has a very strong message.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song can only be called "fun."  I'm not a huge fan of this song, and I don't really like most of the other tracks on the album.  At least not to listen to while driving around in a car.  I would have to listen to it on repeat and it would take me a while to get used to the lyrics.  The only reason I mention this is because this song is not on the album, which is a good thing.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for a good, fun song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is a lot like the song "I'm Yours" by the Foo Fighters.  The only difference is that this one is in English, and the one on the album is in Swedish.  It is not a bad song, but it is definitely not a great one.  If you are looking for a good, upbeat song, look no further.  If you are looking for a great song, however, you may have to look elsewhere.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes a little fun, and not too much seriousness.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like these guys.  The other songs on the album are a little too much of the same thing after a while, but I still liked "Girlfriends" and "I Don't Wanna Know."  I would not recommend this song to anyone.  The songs on the album are either sad or corny.  I wouldn't listen to them, and I don't want to listen to them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is really good.  I really liked "The Only Exception," but I think the rest of the songs are a little too corny.  These guys don't really need the money, and it sounds like they are trying to make the most money in the world, which is kind of sad.  If you want to hear a good song that is not corny, "I Don't Wanna Know" is the song for you.  I don't really like this song, but I like these guys, so I will listen to the rest of the songs to see if they are any good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song sounds really good.  The song is a little different than the other songs on the album, but it is still good.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Amazon review: I buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight Doctors. They should have name it Dr. Who and Daleks Calendar.

This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.

Amazon review: The first track on this album is the worst song ever. There are so many better songs on this album. This song is so bad. And the next song is even worse.

I found this song to be the worst song Jackyl has ever released. I thought it was good when it first came out but the song just got worse with each listen. There was nothing that stood out from the other songs that were on the album. The vocals were pretty good though. I give this album 4 stars.

The album is soooo bad. The vocals sound like they are made from wax. The guitars are all wobbly and out of tune. The drums are pretty good but not the best. The guitar solos are awful and the only thing that makes this album decent is the vocals. The vocals just kill this album.

I don't really care for Jackyl's music at all, but this album didn't sound bad, it just didn't sound good. I think the vocals were okay, but the guitars were out of tune and the drumming needed to be better. The songwriting/singing was the worst thing on the album.

Amazon review: What's the difference between this CD and a CD of the Royal National Band?  The Royal National Band was a group of musicians who, in addition to their full-time job, performed as the band of the British Armed Forces.  The CD is an excellent performance of the British national anthem, so, technically, a Royal National Band CD is a Royal National Band CD.  The Royal National Band is the group most commonly associated with the U.S. Armed Forces in the U.S. The U.S. Armed Forces band has been the "official" band for the U.S. military since the formation of the U.S. Armed Forces.  The U.S. Armed Forces has had its own full-time band since 1920.  The U.S. Armed Forces band has been composed of professional musicians for the last two centuries.  The U.S. Armed Forces band is now composed of professional musicians who have gone through the U.S. Armed Forces band program, which allows the U.S. Armed Forces band to perform as well as any full-time professional orchestra or band in the U.S. The U.S. Armed Forces band is also the only professional military band in the U.S. that has the ability to perform both the U.S. national anthems and the U.S. national anthems of other countries.  The U.S. Armed Forces band has performed the U.S. national anthems at every homecoming and service ceremony since 1920.  The U.S. Armed Forces band's music has played an integral role in the formation and progression of the U.S. Armed Forces and in the history of the U.S. Armed Forces.  The U.S Armed Forces band is the only band in the U.S. that has the ability to perform both U.S. national anthems and U.S. national anthems of other countries.  The Royal National Band is composed of professional musicians who are part of the British Armed Forces, and perform as the band of the British Armed Forces.  The Royal National Band was formed in 1907, with members that formed the band in 1908.  The members of the Royal National Band were the first professional British band in the U.S. The Royal National Band is composed of professional musicians who have been in the U.S. Armed Forces since 1920.  The Royal National Band is the only band in the U.S. that has the ability perform as both the U.S. national anthems and U.S. national thems of other countries.  The Royal National Band has performed the U.S. national anthems at every military ceremony since 1920.

Amazon review: I was in my twenties when I first listened to this album.  It made a very poor impression then, but I thought I'd go back and take another look some decades later.  This trio's creative contributions to the band during Jim Morrison's tenure were undeniably inspired: Ray Manzarek's unique, soulful, creative keyboard renditions, Robby Krieger's classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability, and John Densmore's understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history's greatest rock bands.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: Those that have followed Grace and The Nocs, this is a disappointment.  Grace is much to talented a songwriter for this.  This is an artist like Picaso doing a paint by numbers.  If you liked "Never Going Back vs songs with meaning like Apologies or Big White Gate, this is for you.  Gone are songs with meaning, soul, truth, blues, replaced by techno.  I mss the guitar riffs between Scott and Benny. I miss a piano solo like Stars.  I miss a rocker like "ah Mary" or "Stop the Bus".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is another album that I am not overly fond of.  The songs are very well written and some very good.  Some not so good, but well written with a great story.  The songs have a real melody, but are not overly difficult to sing.  The lyrics are short, but not redundant.

Amazon review:  I've had all the EPs from this band and this is the only one that I don't like.  I will say that I do like the songs better than the other two.  The other two I've really enjoyed, but this one...  I don't know.  I enjoy their music and it's not that they are bad in the sense that I don't like them, but I get the feeling that when you listen to this one you're not getting the same feel from these guys and their music that you get from the other two.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say.  This is your typical garage rock that I have not heard in a really long time.  I just don't think I can put into words how great the music is.  It's like a whole new realm of music has been opened up.  I love that it's so heavy, but it gets really heavy at the same time.  I hate the song "Catch Up", because it has a very strange, but awesome, sound.  I also don't like the song "Hands".  I do like the song "Hands" and the rest of the band's music, but I have not gotten any of the songs.  I do like "I Don't Know Why" and "In the Name of Love".  The songs are all good, but not good enough to be recommended.

Amazon.com review: The songs are great, but this album is a little too much for me.  It's a very long song that goes on for a long time, but I'm not really a fan of that.  The band is a little too repetitive, which is the opposite of what they do, and they just don't sound like the band to me.  I've only heard one album by this group, and that's the only album I've heard, so I can't really comment on all of the songs, but I can tell you that I haven't heard a single one of them yet.  I'm not sure how you get good songs like this, but I'll be the first in line to buy it.  The songs are great and the band is good, but I have not been able to get any of the songs, and I don't know what the problem is.

Amazon.com review: This is a very good album.  I had to listen to it twice to make sure it was one song from it.  The songs are all interesting.  Not all of them are likeable like "I Don't Know Why" and "In the Name of LOVE", but almost all of them are good.  I really like all of the songs.  I don't know what the problem is with the album.  I don't like the songs, but I'm not sure if that's the problem.  I do think this is a pretty good album for the price.

Amazon review: So happy to hear that America has finally become a safe place for all people. I grew up in a conservative home in the South and was brought up to believe that bigotry and intolerance were the norm, not the exception. When I moved to California and my husband found himself in a conservative environment, I was forced to look at the world with a more critical eye. I saw racism, xenophobia, and intolerance everywhere I turned. I became a vocal critic of our government and of President Bush and his administration. While I would never do anything to harm a member of any religious or ethnic group, I have become a vocal critic of our government policies that contribute to the spread of bigotry. As I look back on my life, I realize that I am a better person because of my experiences and because I have spent the last twenty-three years of my life fighting for justice for all people. I believe in the American Dream. I believe in the Constitution of the United States. I believe that everyone should have the same rights and opportunities. I believe that our government is the best form of organization in existence and should be the sole source of power. I believe in the First Amendment, which protects the rights of all citizens. I believe that anyone who disagrees with me, anyone who disagrees with my religious convictions, should be treated with disdain, not reasoned debate. I believe that anyone who attempts to convince me that America is bad and evil, should be treated with disdain, not reasoned debate. I believe that America is a place of liberty, where people can live and worship as they choose; where it is not illegal to practice one's religion, not to mention protect one's free speech rights. I believe that America is a place of liberty, where people can choose to embrace one's beliefs, as long as they do not harm others. I believe that America is a place of liberty, where people can pursue happiness and find fulfillment, as long as they do not harm others. I believe that America was founded on the principles of liberty and justice for all. I believe that America will continue to thrive in the world as long as the principles of liberty and justice for all are embraced. I believe that America was founded on the principles of individual liberty, not government centralization. I believe that America will continue to thrive as long as we reject the false ideals of government centralization, and embrace the ideals of individual liberty and freedom. I believe that America was founded on the principles of individual liberty, and that the government should be limited to its proper role as an enforcer of these principles. I believe that America will continue to thrive as long as we refuse to be a nation of lawbreakers. I believe that America was founded on the principles of individual liberty, that the government should be limited to its proper role as a protector of these principles, and that the government should be reformed. I believe that America will continue to thrive as long as we refuse the false ideals of government centralization, and are prepared to embrace the ideals of individual liberty and freedom. I believe that America was created on the principles of individual liberty and freedom; that government is a necessary evil, and that no government is perfect; that government is the enemy of liberty and freedom; that government should be limited to its proper role as enforcer of these principles; that government should be limited to its proper role as protector of the principles; that government should be reformed; that we are a nation of laws, not men; that the government should be reformed, and that every citizen should be a law-abiding citizen who respects the law of the land.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: The songs are great, but the "Despicable Me" (the song with the weird children singing in the background) is a bit over the top for my taste.  I was happy with the "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and the "Batter Up" songs.  I can't think of the movie in which this song appeared, but I find it catchy.  It is not so catchy that I want to listen to it over and over, but I will listen to it on a few occassions.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the "Despicable Me" songs.  I love the "Batter Up" song.  I like the "The Day the Earth Stood Still" song.  I really like the "Batter Up" song, too.  I bought this CD mainly to hear the "Batter Up" song, and the "The Day the Earth Stood Still" song.  This CD makes it easy to find my favorite songs.  I bought the CD because I loved the movie, and I hoped to hear the songs that made the movie memorable.  I still love the movie, and I still like the songs in it.  I just wish they had made the movie more memorable.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to the "Batter Up" song yet, but I love it.  I think the "Batter Up" song is the most over the top song in the "Despicable Me" movie.  It's sort of like a joke.  I really love the song, but it is a bit of over the top for my taste.  I don't think I could listen to it over and over, because I find it humorous at times.  I was hoping to hear more of the original songs from the movie, but I am just not that interested in listening to the music.  To me, the music is an afterthought, and I don't want to listen to it over and over.  I don't know why the movie is making it into a song, but it doesn't seem like the movie is trying to make a song out of it, so I am happy that "Batter Up" is a song.  I don't think anyone would want to listen to this song over and over, but if it gets you in the mood for a little while, it would be worth listening to.

Amazon review: I have only heard the "Batter Up" song, and I liked it.  I think the song is a bit too over the top for me.  The music is very upbeat, and I don't want it to be over the top, so I am not going to listen to this song over and over.  I am not sure why the movie chose to include this song, but I think it is the best song of the film.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is a fan of the movie.  I think this song is the "Batter Up" song in the movie, but that's not really a musical genre.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The songs on this CD are great.  I like that "Batter Up" is a song, but I really like Batter Up.  I also like "The Day the Earth Stood Still."

I don't think the movie is trying to make a song out of the song, so I am happy with the songs that are included on this CD.

Amazon review: The only song that I felt was not worth listening to was "Despicable Me."  I thought it was really good, but I was a little disappointed that the song was not included in the movie.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

However, you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record. My old records have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old, but as soon as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any levels. It is like the speaker was blown, very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music.

Amazon review: This is an awful Curious George album. I don't know why my sister gave me this CD when I was at my in-laws, because I don't like this CD. I hate the song "Who's Your Daddy". There are some good songs on this album, but the songs are all really annoying to me.

Amazon review: I bought each of the Tigerland albums I've had for a very long time. I love the music, I love the lyrics, and I love the stories. I have the Tigerland albums on CD and I listen to them on my computer and on my stereo. I also have the Curious George album on CD and I listen to it on my stereo. Then I have the Curious George book, "Who's Your Daddy". This book and the CDs are my favorite books and CDs. I don't know why I have so many CDs of Curious George music, but I have them. I have Tigerland on CD and I listen to it on my stereo. I also have the Curious George CD and I listen to it on my stereo. I have the Curious George book and I listen to it at home, in my car on the road, and in my front room. I also have the Tigerland book and I listen to it in my front room. At the same time I listen to the songs from the Tigerland CD and I listen to the songs from the Curious George CD. The Tigerland CDs are my favorites and I listen to them every day. When I listen to the Tigerland and Curious George CDs I always listen to the songs that I have already listened to.
In addition to these CDs, I have the Curious George TV show DVD and the Curious George book DVD. The books are all favorites of mine and I listen to them every day.
I enjoy reading both the Curious George books and the Tigerland books. The Tigerland books are my favorite books.
I listen to the Curious George album, Tigerland album, and Curious George book as often as I can in order to hear the songs that I have already heard.
When I go to restaurants, I will always ask the waitress or waiter if they have Tigerland or Curious George CDs.
I love reading the books and CDs, but I always have to ask if they have the Tigerland albums or the Curious George CDs.
I love the songs and I love the lyrics. I love the music and the stories. I love the books and CDs.
I have listened to every Curious George CD, Tigerland CD, and Curious George book

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: I could not get more than half way through really boring book.  Not only was it boring but it jumped around in time between chapters.  Drove me crazy. Begins 30 years ago then jumps to present then back to 1822 to present back to 1822 back to present.  The only thing keeping me going to the half way point was waiting for something to happen.  It never did so I gave up.

Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review:"I can't get enough" is the first song I ever heard Nirvana play on "Nevermind."  I couldn't stop playing it, I was playing it all day and all night long.  I loved this song so much.

Amazon review: You would think that this is the exact same track from the Paperman short, but you would be wrong. It's missing the electric guitar that comes in at 5:15 during the actual video. Meaning it is meant to be present around the 3:40 mark for the mp3. For me, this omission ruins the entire track. Disappointed.

Amazon review: Not what I was looking for- I wanted a reading of the sanskrit, the word for word definitions and the translation. The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album as I have listened to countless albums by The Beatles, Tom Petty, John Lennon, and more.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.
