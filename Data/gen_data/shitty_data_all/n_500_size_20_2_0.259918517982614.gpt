Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

About the title:

When I first heard "The Hustle" I was really excited. I thought it was one of the most unique songs I had ever heard. It's kind of like the Beatles version, except it's not as clean and the voice is a little deeper. The lyrics are also a little different. The song is a little slower than the Beatles version, and the tempo is a little more of a fast-slow-fast thing. That's why I called it "a different version" of this song.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.

Amazon review: I have a soft spot for this band.  They are a great live act.  I was lucky on my birth night to see them at the old El Rey Theatre.  I have seen them many times since.  Great show.  The music is excellent, the whole band is talented.  They played with passion, with great energy and had the audience in the palm of their hand.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: My favorite song on the album is the first one (which is a remix) called "All the Time". I think it is my favorite song of all time. I just love the way he sounds, and that the melody of the song so beautifully blends with his vocals that it really stands out.

Amazon review: My favorite song is "Don't Wanna Lose You". The lyrics are so beautiful and catchy.  I love the way he sings it.

Amazon review: I have been a John Mayer fan since I was about 8 years old so when he decided to go into self-produced pop again, I was like "WHAT???".  Now, I can understand why he did it and I appreciate him for doing it.  After all, his 3rd album was the most downloaded in the whole world.  This album is the best thing to ever come out of his career.  Its soooooo good. I love the song "Don't Wanna Lose You".  Its my favorite song.  Its great!

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I was looking at the news today and I saw a picture of a guy who was shot and killed by police. The story said that it was a drug dealer and the police shot as he ran away. I didn't know what to think. I am a very law abiding citizen. I always say to people that I have never gotten into any legal trouble. I don't have any kind of criminal record. I just don't. I've never been in trouble with the police or my neighbors or anything else for that matter. How would I know if they were doing it wrong or if I was doing it wrong? I don't really understand it. As this guy ran past me, he was screaming to the police to shoot him, but I don't really understand it. I was thinking, man, the cops are not supposed to shoot people. I guess I am just not supposed to be the kind of person that police kill.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of the music of the 80's. All the music that came out at that time in the 80's was so predictable and cheesy. But I have to say this song is a classic. I love the guitar sound and the drum sounds. I also love the song's lyrics. The song that I love most, is "Get off the pot". This song was originally a hit in the early 70's, but it had a slower and more subdued sound in the mid 70's. It was when it had a hip hop beat that it became a hit.

He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

I've been searching for a copy of this band or album for years, and when I saw it on Amazon for just $5 as a gift for a friend, I knew that I had to get it, because I love the music.  I've been collecting music ever since I was a little kid.  What this album brings back to me is not just the music, but the memories and the stories.  It's a great album for the Beatles fan--but I also love the songs from the 50's like "Can't Help Falling In Love" and "Honey".  I think that the songs from the 50's are so good that they are better than the Beatles, and that's why I want to buy this album for all my Beatles fan friends.  I hope that they enjoy it as much as I do.

Amazon review: I love the album.  I really enjoyed this album.  It is a really good album.  The music is great.  The vocals are amazing.  I will be purchasing the original version of "The Christmas Album".  The only bad thing is that a cover of "Christmas in June is included on this album.  There is no need to play the song.  The song is a good cover but the original song is much better.  I hope that the original version of Christmas in June will not be available on this CD.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
