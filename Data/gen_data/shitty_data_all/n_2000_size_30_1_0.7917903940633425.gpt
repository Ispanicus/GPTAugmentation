Amazon review: It would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of Jenni's father Geoff and an admired of her mother, Maria. So.  Those questions are answered. As for the CD and Jenni on her own, this is a well thought out, highly listenable and original album.  It has been playing on my equipment for several years now, and wears well. Enjoy.

Amazon review: Took his course up at the conference center. AMAZING! Changed my life. Increased my biblical understanding by 1000%! You simply can not go wrong with this. and Dan has been teaching this method to students of all types, cultures, countries, and languages for generations. it works, and you will understand it. All material, not a lot of added unnecessary b.s. (sorry). in other words the focus is the lessons, NOT Dan! If I could buy it for you, I would.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

I thought it was going to be a great album and had high hopes for this one. I was shocked at the finale when I found out this was a new album. I also think that it should have been more like his first two albums. I thought this album was going to be better than his previous albums. I really enjoyed listening to this album, but I felt it was a little bland without the songs he had on his first two albums. I think I will have to buy the original albums, but it was nice to finally hear some of the songs I've been waiting for.

Amazon review:  The album is great!  I've been a Nirvana fan for years and have been waiting for the first CD.  I never thought I would be able to say that I love Nirvana.  That's saying a lot.  The songs are great, the guitar playing is really tight, and there's an awesome and unique sound to the album.  I'm really happy I got this CD.  I was really worried I wouldn't like it because I've never liked Nirvana before.  Now, I do.  I also agree with the other reviews who say it is a little bland, but I think it is still very enjoyable, even though it's not the original.  I think it's better than the first two Nirvana albums.  I also think it is better than the first two albums by the band and I think this is the right album to purchase.  I mean, I was pretty much expecting it to be like the first two albums and it is better.  It's still a very good album and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good music.  I believe it's the best Nirvana album so far.

I'm glad I bought this album and I'm looking forward to purchasing the next album.  It is the best Nirvana album so far.

Amazon review: I would not buy this album.  I do not think it is even a album.  It is a collection of songs that are so different from each other (in sound and style) they are not even comparable.  I love the music, I love the band, I love the album.  I don't understand why this band is so bad.  They are good people with good music.  I'm sure they have good intentions and this album is the closest they will be able to get to their first two albums.  I don't see this album as an album.  It should be considered a collection of songs that are good but not great.  I love the music and I do not care about the band or their "style."  If they had any real talent they would release an album of real music.  They should not put out this kind of garbage.  This is a great album if the band members were more talented and the songs were actually good.

I have listened to this album many times and I still love every song on this album.  When I am listening to it I am never bored.  I am in awe of how great this band was and how well they were able to sing and play the music.  I am still amazed that this band was able to make this amazing album and I am glad I got it.  I would recommend this album to anyone who has a dream of being a rock star.  I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they can be a rock star.  It is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

Amazon review: I am a vocal man, so I have always admired Christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music, why is it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this song mean, during my era of music it was pretty simple. Journey. Lovin',Touchin', Squeezin', pretty simple huh. Def Leppard. Pour Some Sugar On Me, no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about!

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

I love post-Waters Floyd, Floyd with Roger Waters, and  I love a lot of the solo songs from Waters, from Gilmour, and from Wright.  I didn't enjoy this album.  I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Bob Dylan since I was a kid, but I hadn't been listening to him since the early '70s, when he had a bunch of other stuff going.  I just started listening to him again recently and found out the other day that he has been a longtime friend of mine.  I was so excited when I found out  he had recorded his new album, and just like that I was sold on it.  It's just a really cool, really good, totally different type of album.  I'm not really going to be doing much listening to it.  I didn't like the songs on it.  I don't think they belong on this blog.  I'm not going to make a big deal of it.  My friends will be listening to it, and I'll be listening to it, and when I'm through listening to it I'll just forget about it.  I think it's just a really cool album.

Amazon review:  This is not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination, not even close.  It may have been a bit experimental at times, but it's not really all that different from Bob Dylan's best work.  It's just not one of his best albums.  It was good, but it had some really, really poor songs that were a bit off-key.  It was a good record, but not one of his best.  Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first album I have ever heard of this  young, unknown, and untitled artist called  John Lee Hooker.  I knew nothing of him when I found out about this  album.  I had never heard of the Rolling Stones before  I found out about this album.  I had not heard of Bob Dylan until I found out about this album.  I have no idea who this artist is, and he is a great artist that I don't really know anything about.  I'm not saying he's a bad artist, maybe he isn't either.  He just has nothing to do with my favorite artists like Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Neil Young, and The Beatles.  I don't really know anything about him and he doesn't really know me.  I just enjoy listening to him.  I don't know why I enjoy listening to him.  It's just one of those albums that I don't know why I enjoy listening to it.

Amazon review:  This is one of those weird albums that I didn't really care for at all.   It's a good album, but there are some pretty terrible songs on it.  The only song I really liked was "I'll Catch Her"  and the song is an absolute masterpiece.  I listened to it about 15 times, and I still love it.  It was a really good album.  I thought it would be great, but it wasn't.  I think it's a really good album, but it's not as good as I thought it would be.  I really didn't love any of the songs on it.  I don't know why I didn't love it.  It's just weird.  I can't really explain it.  I don't know what the album is about at all.  It just isn't for me.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: The vocals are not what made the album so great.  It's the beautiful songwriting that took the album to the next level.  The song "So Close" is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The lyrics are powerful, the guitar work is beautiful and the piano arrangement is beautiful.  The song "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  The music style is also beautiful and I love the harmonies and the lyrics.  This album reminded me of the band Coldplay.  I like the music and the lyrics on this album.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

This cd is not out of date just the cd is out of date.  The cd will come in handy for anyone that likes to dance and for people that play a lot of music.  And to the many people that play music in the church.  This cd can be used to help you to grow spiritually.

Amazon review: This is some good music, right here! LaRue is a vocal beast. I had the pleasure of being at the live recording and I was blown away with her vocals, the background vocals and the band. Everything was on point. The music as easy to follow and I didn't feel cheated when it came to ministry. Although it was the recording for her CD, she still stayed with the ministry element and tears were flowing, hands were praised, and praises were being given to The Father.

Amazon review: This is the first album of the band FOUR that I have ever purchased, and I am glad I did.  This is a great band with a great sound.  They play a good mix of Cajun, Zydeco, and Southern Rock.  The band is also a great mix of the old school and new school, and I like that they play songs that I have also heard on other bands.  They are a great band, and I would highly recommend this recording to anyone who enjoys playing music.

Amazon review:  The vocal harmonies on this CD are extremely strong and well put together.  The arrangements are clean, while still retaining a bit of rock and roll flair.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to music.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: Sad sad album! As an old fan of Marilyn Mccoo I jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release. to my deception! The album is a collection of old hits produced like it was recorded in a lobby of a 2 stars hotel! They both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though Marilyn Mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english. The Highlight of this album is her reedition of Bacharah's This Girl's in Love With You. There are two extra dowloadable songs that only god knows how it works to get it!

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: I never knew this band, but I'm glad I found them. I'm in total disagreement with their music. It's a strange, bizarre, and bizarrely beautiful blend of folk, jazz, and dance. I don't even know where to begin to explain how bizarre. They've created an entirely new genre of music, that sounds like it came from the '50s, '60s, or '70s. I don't know if it's music, but it's certainly different, and I'm glad I discovered it.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums ever made. I've been a fan of Radiohead since the early 2000's. They are one of my favorite bands.

Amazon review: My first encounter with this band was the day after I saw them perform live, and I was blown away. I was impressed with the music and the energy they put forth. Their first album is a mix of their early work, some of their more recent work, and some of their personal material. But what really makes this album stand out is the sheer diversity of the music. It's very eclectic and interesting, but it works because of the quality of the songs. The songs are diverse but stand out by their unique lyrical content. This album is a lot of fun.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

True, I've always liked Lucinda.  In a world of boy bands and shallow pop music she's been a constant factor, not always brilliant, but always heartfelt and sincere, providing a steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country, blues and rock.

The songs that were on this disc were all great but this disc is not as good as the other discs.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: This song is really nice and fun.  I like the song, but I don't really think I'll be listening to it long enough to know.  I love the melody and the fact that it's so relaxing.  This song is a little bit on the light side, and I'm not really sure if I'll be listening to it long enough to know, but I don't really think I'll be listening to it long.  It's nice, but I'll probably just listen to it on the way home, then pass it up.  But that's nothing to be sad about.  I mean, I love the song, and I love the melody, and I love listening to it again and again, so I'm not feeling too bad about it.

Amazon review: The lyrics are not at all terrible.  They just didn't seem to have a good ending.  It's a good song, and it's very catchy, but it just didn't seem to have a good ending.  I don't know if it was the lyric or just the song, but it just didn't seem to go the way it was suppose to.  It's got a nice little melody and it's very relaxing, but I just don't think I'm going to listen to it long enough to know.  It's nice, but I'll probably just listen to it while I'm driving or something like that.  But that's nothing to be sad about.  I mean it's nice, and the song is very catchy, and I like listening to it over and over, so it's not really too bad.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

So there is no doubt that the new album is better than the other albums they have made.  I won't list those albums, but you can easily find them on the internet if you search.  I would like to say that if you like the new Beatles album, then you need to listen to the Beatles on the radio.  You will hear all kinds of things that you never heard before.  You can't help but have some kind of reaction to it.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll think.  It's great and I really hope that you don't think it is bad, because it is great.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this album. The album has three songs that stood out to me: "You Don't Know Me" and "My Heart Will Go On" which are both amazing songs. The album is also very interesting because I really really like the songs 'I Don't Know Me' and 'You Don't Know Me' and they are both really good songs. The album is also excellent for its entire run time, it is worth a listen, especially for the songs 'You Don't Know Me' and 'My Heart Will Go On'.  I don't know what happened to this album.  It had the potential to be something great and it is very disappointing that it is still nothing but a rehash of songs that were already on other albums.  I would have given this album five stars except for the re-recorded versions of 'You Don't Know Me' and 'My Heart Will Go On' and the songs 'I Don't Know Me' and 'You Don't know Me'.  I'm really disappointed and I'm ashamed to say that I would have given this album five stars if it was an original recording.

Amazon review: The entire album is great. I just wish there was more variety in the songs in the set.  The set is good for an old country album.  I know some people are going to hate it, but I love it.  I love John Prine and I love Hank Williams.  I just don't have a lot of albums in my collection that are from the 50's.  Some are good, a couple are ok, and the rest are just meh.  I would like to hear someone else sing a song that I like, or at least a song that I think is a bit different from the norm.  I have the albums of the Beatles and the Stones, so I know the songs that are there, and I know some that I don't know.  I have an idea, maybe a song by one of my favorite authors, or some old classic rock.  A song from the 40's would be awesome.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: It is true that this is a great song!   I have been listening to this song for a while and I just found out the other day that the version I have is the original version released on the Mercury LP.  It is a great song.

I would buy this CD again if they would have just released the original version on the CD.

Amazon review: I'm glad you finally decided to listen to this.  I can't believe I waited so long to hear it!  I would love to hear you cover this song.  I think it takes a lot of courage to be yourself and speak your mind.  It really is the truth.  I think this song is the most powerful song in the world.  It is not the kind of song you can sing to a friend and say you were there.  It is the kind of song you have to be in order to hear.

Amazon review: I really like the first 10 seconds or so of this song.  I was listening to it after a hard day of work (no pay) and was so depressed at the end of the day. The second 10 seconds or so of this song is a little annoying, but the rest of it is really inspiring.  It's catchy and I like the lyrics.  I've listened to other songs on this album, but this one is my favorite.  I would love to hear you cover this song.  I think you should do it.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.
