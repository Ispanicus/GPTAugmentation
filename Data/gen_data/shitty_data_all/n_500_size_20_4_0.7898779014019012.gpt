Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Queen is a bit too "chaste" for my taste, but that makes me think of the days of a pre-war, pre-baby, pre-pregnancy, pre-lunch, pre-dinner, pre-sex, pre-bed mentality. When our hormones are out of control and we don't have time to be a complete idiot.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this one zero stars, it's not great. It's a lot of filler and I don't like most of the filler in this song. The chorus is pretty decent, but the actual song is just filler. I know the video is supposed to be pretty, but it's nothing that stands out.

Amazon review: I am not sure if this is the best Crystal Bowersox album, because it does have good songs on it. I don't like the video, I don't like one song on the album, the other songs are pretty good, the album might have been better if it was longer.  I do like Crystal Bowersox though.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Really hate this song.  Not that I expect anything less from a Ne-yo album, but man, this one is just awful.  It's so bad that I can't even believe that there is even a song called "Love Me Not Enough".  It's like the guy went around the whole world and tried to find a single song that he liked, then he threw it into the mix.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if I should be offended.  I mean, I'm happy that Ne-yo is my favorite hip-hop artist, and I'm even happy that I'm a fan of his, but this album is just so bad.

I just can't get into this album at all.  I don't know what to say.  There are very few redeemable songs on this album.  The best song is "You're Not Alone".  This is the only good song on the entire album.  The rest of the songs are completely horrible.  The only good song is "You're Not Alone".  This is the only good track on the entire album.

Amazon review:  I am always a bit suspicious of anything that claims to be a "cure."  I am not interested in having a "cure" for my insomnia.  I know that sleep deprivation can be very dangerous for me.  I am certainly not taking any new medications for my insomnia.  Not even a placebo.  I am just hoping for a long sleep.  Sleep and relaxation is what I need and what I will get.  This just gets in the way.  This is a waste.

Amazon review: I'll take the "cure" for my insomnia over any other "cure."  The song is not bad.  I think it is a little on the generic side.  A little bland, maybe.  But it's a good generic song.  I'm just frustrated, disappointed, and disappointed in myself for wasting $.99 on this.  I'm sure this was just a fluke.  I haven't been able to sleep for more than a few hours without the song on my ipod.  I have to give the guy his day because I have to get up at 5:00 am and go to the office and I am not sure if I will be able to sleep at that time.  I really am tired and I am not sure if I want to get up at that time and go to work.  Maybe I'll just get up and stay in bed.  I don't want to get up and go to work.  This is a waste of money.  I'll look for something else.  I have to get up in the morning.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Sugar Kane made their first album, so I'm really glad they did a great second album.

He can't believe that she loves another guy and he wants her to go away, and she does. She says she will go away with him and then she says she will go away with him. I don't like the song "I can't believe you" I don't like the vocalist either. The song "You never know" is good and I like the song "So much better".

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

This is because I have a problem with a few words in the title.   I don't know how to say "love this song" in the title.  I think the "I" in "I love this song" should be silent but it's not.
Thank you very much.  

A:

What is going on here is that you have placed two of your question marks inside of the phrase "I love this song".
This is a common occurrence in spoken English, but not a frequent one. If you look at your document, you'll notice that the question mark appears in the middle of the word "this".
What you need to do, therefore, is to either remove the question mark from the phrase "I love this song" or to add one more to the end of the phrase.
Note that if you are using a word processor, you can use the Replace feature to remove the question mark.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You can also use the Replace feature that comes with your word processor to add a question mark to the end of the phrase.

 

 

A:

You can't say "love this song (without the question mark), because "love" is a preposition.  "This" is an adverb, not a noun.
So, you need to change the preposition to a noun, such as "this song" 
... or 
... or 
... or 
... or 
And you can't say "I love this song" because "love" is a preposition and "I" is a pronoun.  The only way to say, "I love this song," is to use the sentence "I love this song" which is the normal sentence.  

 

A:

I know this is an old answer, but for the purpose of the question, I would prefer to use "love this song" and I would say the song itself is pretty catchy. I would prefer to say "love this song" instead of "I love this song" because "this song" is a noun, and "I" is an pronoun that belongs to the noun "song". And the same logic applies to "I love this song" with "this song" being a noun and "I" being a pronoun.

I love that there is not a song that you can't dance to.  This album keeps you on the dance floor the whole time.

Amazon review: This album really is a keeper.  It is a good album.  It is a good CD.  I have listened to it a few times now and it holds up very well.  The only downside to this CD is that the "collide" song is soooo over the top.  It is like the band was on a drug trip for weeks, adding all kinds of crazy stuff and making it sound like the end of the world.  The one song that I did not like is the "Fifty Ways" song.  I thought it was cool, but I really do not like it.  I like "Collide" a lot better.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is my new favorite CD.  It is a real treat to listen to!  I love the vocals and the overall sound of this album.  I love the fact that you can listen to the songs all day, but still get a good night of sleep at night.  It is so relaxing.  If someone told me that I would be able to listen to this album all day and still fall asleep at night, I would be very proud of myself.  It is awesome!

Amazon review: This album is so good!!!  I was not expecting to like it that much.  But I love it so much!!!  I love the songs.  I love the lyrics.  It is very good.  I really wish that there was more but as it is now it is still great.  I really like the "collide" song.  I do not like the "Fifty Ways" song.  I will buy the rest of the CD, but only if it is in a CD player.  It is great that there is a CD in the car, but I would not want the CD to be in the same room as me.  But I do not mind the CD in the boat.  I like it to be played in the boat and then while we are on the boat.  I think that it is so much better to listen to in the boat and then when we are at the dock.  It is so much better to listen to the CD while we are on the boat.  It is so much better than just listening to the CD in the car.

Amazon review: I love the vocals of this CD.  It is really good.  I am a big fan of The Osmonds.  I think that I would like to buy more of their CDs, but only if the songs are good.  I do not like the songs that have an "x" at the end.  The songs that have a "x" at the beginning are the best.  The songs that do not have "x" at the beginning are just okay.  I do not like the "Collide" song.  I do not like the other songs that are on this CD.

Amazon review: This song is one of my favorites and I have been waiting for the release of this song for a long time and finally its here, and I would say that the music is a little bit too similar to this song and the lyrics are just plain boring and could have been better. I would only pay for this song if I had a big screen TV to watch it on. Otherwise, I would not be paying for this song.
