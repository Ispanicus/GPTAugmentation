Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: I had this album on my hands when I decided to take a trip to New York City to see the city.  It was my first trip to New York, and I was excited to see the sights.  This album came out in the time I was back home.  It could have been a great album, but it was not.  It was bad, boring, and just plain bad.  It was the most disappointing album I have ever heard.  It is a good thing that it was released during my trip because I would have been so disappointed.  It is a bad album, and I would only buy it if it was $25.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: If you were to tell me to look at any one of these songs, I could listen to them until my ears bleed. This is true. After years of listening to hip hop, this is the most consistent, coherent, and complete collection of original songs I have heard in years. The production is also very good; the beats are tight and well mixed. The lyrics are concise and not too long. Most of these songs are very well written and delivered with a sense of humor. Overall, this is a wonderful collection of hip hop music.

I love this album. I feel the music is very good and the lyrics are very good. The album also has an amazing and very different sound to it. I have bought a lot of music for my car with this album because it has a certain sound that I love and I also love the lyrics. I have been in high school for the last six years and I have been learning more and more about music. I have been learning about music because I have been listening to the Run The Jewels music. This album is one of the reasons why I believe that music will be better then it is today. I know that there are many other albums that are great, but this album is one of the best. I think that this was a great song and I hope that this album will be played a lot by people that are young to listen to rap music.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: I don't understand what was so great about this album. The songs were pretty. The production was OK. I don't think I was entertained by the music at all. The lyrics were ok.

Amazon review: This album was the worst of the worst. It was horrible. It was boring. It was ugly. It was unlistenable. It was boring and it was horrible.

Amazon review: A lot of the songs on this album have the potential to be really good but because of the music industry, it's hard to get a hit. They have songs like "I'll Be You and I'll Be Me" and a huge hit "I'm A Believer." It seems like a big hit but it's not. It's a song about a woman who gets a lot of attention but ultimately she doesn't deserve it. It's a great song if you're a fan of the Temptations but not for everyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I guess I'm just a little disappointed because I think this album is really great. I don't find it boring at all.

But what was on this album was awful. I thought it was better than the album I got from them and it is really disappointing. I was really hoping for good songs but they have some great songs but all they have is all the same songs over and over. For a band that is supposed to be good you'd think they would make a different record. I'm hoping for the next time they release a more diverse album.

Amazon review: I was really hoping this band would come back after a long break. But this is a really disappointing album, it really is. If only they could have come back with a better album and released songs with more diversity. This album has a lot of repetitiveness and I just don't get it. Not only that, the songs sound kind of the same. It's a really bad album. I don't understand why they released this album. I think they should have just put out another good album.
