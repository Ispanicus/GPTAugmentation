Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all. The singers aren't louder than the accompaniment, so what is the point of a song if you can't hear or understand the words, especially in a Christmas carol.  There is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty.

Amazon review: There must have been a bunch of ripe songs sitting around the basement when Juliana Hatfield showed up to help record them. Some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the Mats. Others are not so great, but they may grow on me. (But not that one about birds.) I'm just happy Paul is digging out some gems and recording them in an inspired way. If it takes romance to make that happen, so much the better.

Amazon review: As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.

Amazon review: I am a little late to join the party when it comes to this artist, but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for Thinking Out Loud on youtube (I didn't realize it had been played to death on the radio according  to friends)  I love  the cd.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

I have to admit that I have only heard one of the songs from the album, and that's the one with the song called "My Blues" (I'm giving this one a 1 star because it's the only song that I've heard so far). I am a big fan of Hall & Oates, and I've only heard one of their songs from their collection of albums, and that's "The Other One" from their debut album. The Other One was a big hit for them, and I was really hoping that I could hear a song from their collection, but I haven't heard it yet. I believe this album is one of the best blues albums I've heard this year. Very bluesy, very good.

Amazon review: With a very soothing voice I thought I would drift off immediately to sleep. You are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace. When her voice leaves you assumably asleep for 20 minutes you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that  sounds more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire. The sound of the wind is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

"CSN" never supassed that first album, either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums.

Amazon review: This is a poor recording of a great performance.  I thought my stereo amplifier was damaged when I heard the periodic crackling noises while playing the Peer Gynt Suites 1 and 2.

This CD might be passable if you just listen to music on an iPod or phone.  However, if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo, don't waste your money on this rubbish.

My biggest problem with the CD was the fact that it was on sale for $15.  I don't want to spend so much money and I don't want to buy a CD that I don't like.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I received an email saying that I had not pre-ordered this CD and it was still on their website.  I was so excited with the album that I ordered and then I found out the only album I ordered was the demo.  I then had to wait another month until my copy of the album came in the mail.  The only problem with this is that the CD will not play back on my computer.  I had to just transfer it to my computer and then transfer it to an external hard drive and then transfer it to an MP3 player.  I really can't wait to get this CD, so I can finally get a copy of the album.  I will say this, the songs are quite good and a lot of them have catchy songs.  I still have not listened to the whole album yet but have listened to the first 4 songs on the album.  The first song was okay, but the rest of the songs were pretty good.  I have a feeling I may like the album a lot more than what I thought I would like it.

It sounds like a train coming out of a broken speaker, and you can hear the tracks skipping.  It's not worth the $20 price tag either.

It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: The first two sentences of this song are sung by a woman. Then a man sings the rest of the song. "I've been lying to myself all these years." This song has the feel of a love song but it's not that kind of love song. It's a love song for the woman's own self-delusion.

Amazon review: I'm glad I waited to buy this, because I really didn't want to buy it.  The CD had no music for me.  I was upset when I found out the CD was only 2 hours long.  I thought I'd get to hear a few good songs, but it didn't turn out that way.  It just sounded like nothing I ever heard before.  Don't waste your money.  It's almost an insult to your intelligence to recommend this CD to anyone, let alone pay for it.

Amazon review: I thought this CD was a great gift.  However, after listening to it, I can't say that it was as good as I expected it to be.  I loved the first few songs and thought it might be a nice present for someone, but after about half way through, I couldn't get into the songs.  I loved the album, I loved the music, but I can't say I loved the CD.  The songs aren't bad, and I do appreciate the music that they put out.  I just can't say I'm a big fan of the CD.

This CD is very enjoyable and quite different from the original.  I would say it is worth the price of admission.  This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times and I can only think of one song that is a little repetitive.  That being the first track 'Beef Jerky'.  Also the second track 'You're The One For Me' is not a true song.  It is just two lines repeated in the song.  It sounds like it is a pop song and this is the only song that I can remember that is that.  The only other song I can think of is 'I'm A Believer' which I really like but I can only think of one line.  I really like the CD but it will be difficult to replace a song or two.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves good music.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: I was looking for a worship album that was different from the usual worship albums I buy. I found this one to be a really good worship album.  I like the songs of this album, and the only thing I don't like is that it's not very long. It's not long, but it doesn't have the big songs that you would typically find in a worship album.  It's not too long, but it doesn't have the bigger songs that you would typically find in a worship album.  The songs on this album are pretty good, and I would give this album 5 stars if I could.  It would be perfect for a church that doesn't have a lot of money, but has a lot of people who like worship music.  This worship album is in the style of "Worship at the Capitol," but I don't know if that style is even possible anymore.  If it is, this album is for you.  This book is so good.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: Okay, I think I've stumbled upon something here. It's not so much a bad CD as a mediocre CD. There are some good songs on this CD, but they aren't really memorable. They all come up with a little surprise and it is a little disconcerting to not know what the next track will be.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.
