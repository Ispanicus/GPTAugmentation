Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I am glad I bought this album.  This is my favorite album of this genre.  The lyrics are very deep and meaningful.  One thing that sets this album apart from the others is that it doesn't have a pop-duet.  The last track is a beautiful ballad, and the next few tracks are all instrumental.  This album is very good.

Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Is this the worst song ever? This song is a great addition to her discography.  When I first heard Amy Macdonald, I was impressed with her voice and lyrical ability. I was blown away by her writing ability. Her talent and ability to write lyrics that are so emotional and meaningful is astounding to me. I love the way she sings. I love how the lyrics and the melody compliment each other so perfectly. I love the way she can take seemingly ordinary phrases and create something that has so much meaning to me.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

From Amazon.com:
Three Days Grace: The Best Band in the World

Three Days Grace is the best band in the world. I love every song on the album, it's almost like listening to a band that I've never heard of before, but they have an incredible sound. I love the way they mix their own music with heavy metal and blues, and then they put in some heavy metal and blues, and a little bit of their own music.

This is one of those albums that any fan of rock or metal can enjoy. If you like heavy metal, then you will love this album. If you like your rock or blues music mixed in with a little heavy metal, then this is the album for you.

This album has a lot of different genres mixed together, but it sounds great. It's very heavy metal and blues, but with a hint of country. It has great songs like "I Will Be There," "Just Between You" and "I Will Remember You" with the band's signature sound. This album is a great introduction to Three Days Grace at all. This is my all time favorite band.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I heard about this album from another reviewer, and decided to give a listen.  I was pleasantly surprised by the "real" sound of this recording.  The Beatles used to do this when they were recording, and we always know that something is going to sound "real" even if it isn't.  So, in a way, that "realness" is what makes this so good.

Amazon review: This song is not a typical Dylan song, but is still good.  It has a great melody, and the lyrics make sense.

Amazon review: This is one of the few songs that I actually hear in the live performances. I do not think I've ever heard this version in any of the live performances I've seen.

I think one of the reasons it was not released is because it really is the sound of a live performance.

Amazon review: I really enjoy the song.  It's not a song that I think I would want to listen to in a car or in the shower.  But it's a song that my wife can listen to all day at work and she loves it.  It's the sort of song that makes you feel good, that you can feel good about.  The melody that comes in on this song is something that you could imagine playing in a church.  The lyrics are good, and that's the most important thing.

Amazon review: I love him, not as much as he does, but I have enjoyed all his music to this point. You can find songs like this on any album in the genre, nothing was added to the music world from this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The opening track "Voodoo" is on the first disc, The closing track "St. Vincent" is on the second disc.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a bad album, I guess. I have no idea why it's so unpopular. I don't even remember ever listening to the first two discs before I got this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I guess I'll give this album another listen in a week or so. It's definitely not one of these "unlistenable" albums, but it's not exactly what I'd call "good." It's not bad, but it's definitely not great either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not really sure what to say about this album other than it is the worst thing I have ever heard in my life. The band sounds exactly the same every time, and the lyrics are just plain boring and annoying. I understand they sound similar to NFG, but they're not the same band. The vocals aren't terrible, the music is not terrible, but they are not even close to NFG. There's a reason their album sold over 30,000 copies. I would try listening to this one once, find a better song, and not bother to listen to it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why I would buy this album or why anyone would purchase this album. It's not my cup of tea. I don't think I've had a worse experience than listening to this album. The songs are all the same, the vocals are all the same, the music is all the same, the lyrics are all the same, the instrumentation is all the same, and it's all just so damn boring. This album is a waste of space.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think I have had the same opinion about this album since I first heard it, I listened to it a lot and bought it a few times and I think I got bored with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have enjoyed the other Sousa albums, but I really didn't like this one. I didn't like the vocals, I didn't like the music, and I didn't like the lyrics. I think it's an average Sousa album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know I'm late, but I'd like to say I like the album, but the only time it really stood out was the first song, "Voodoo."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the first two albums, and I like the next few albums, but for some reason I always put the disc in the middle of my list, and sometimes it feels like there's a gap between the first two discs and the next few discs. I really like the disc that I put in the middle, but I don't know why. It's the only one that I like, but I like it really little.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with the other reviews. I don't see how this album could possibly be more terrible than "The Making of a Legend" or "Merry Christmas." I can't believe this album sold even 30,000 copies.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of the Sousa march band. I am still enjoying the second CD from Sousa and I am still enjoying the Sousa march bands in general. This CD is a bit better than the first two but it still falls under the same category. The music is ok and the artwork is pretty to look at. The songs are ok. They were not horrible and they did not fail to entertain me. However there are a few songs that just don't hold up to repeated listening. "Voodoo" and "The Night of the Hunter" are really just filler. I feel this album is a bit better than the first two and I still listen to the "Merry Christmas" CD a lot.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. The first three discs are very good. I liked the music and the lyrics. The last three discs are disappointing. I agree with the other reviewers that I don't know why they put this disc in the middle.

Amazon review: Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.

###
Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: not to much into the hard rock sound.
