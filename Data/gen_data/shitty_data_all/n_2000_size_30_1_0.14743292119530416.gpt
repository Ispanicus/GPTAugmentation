Amazon review: Stanley Climbfall had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on "No Name Face". Talk about a Sophmore slump! The first singe "Spin" is pretty good, as is the title track. The best track on the record is "Take Me Away", it is BEAUTIFUL! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd. that's junk!

A great, albeit short, ballad that is very much a Marianne Faithfull trademark. It's a little over two minutes long and features lots of Marianne Faithfull's trademark growls and deep, soulful voice. The song's lyrics are great, too.

Amazon review: I wanted to get the CD with the "Ode to Billie Joe" song on it. The songs on this album are so good and I love the ballads. I do have to say that I did not like the music on either of the songs that were played. I can't remember the name of the first song, but it was not very good. The arrangement was very simple and just sounded like the songs played in the movie. It was very boring. I am not a big fan of Ode to Billie Joe because it is a very simple song. I found the song "If I Were a Boy" to be the best song on the CD. It was interesting, and the arrangement was very good. I really like the band, and would not have traded the songs for anything else. I just love these songs and I am glad they are on this album.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite CDs. I like to listen to the Beatles and this is the only album I have ever actually bought, not downloaded from the Internet, and I was very excited to buy it on a Sunday night. I have listened to the CD over 10 times in the past week and I can't stop listening to it. I am very impressed at how easy it is to download the songs. The songs are great and I really like the arrangements. The only problem I have with this CD is the fact that it is a live recording of one of their concerts. I had to stop listening to it after a few songs because of this. Once I downloaded the songs and listened to them on my own it was fine.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD all day and am very impressed. The songs are very good and I like the arrangements and the ballads. I was a big fan of the Beatles and I really liked the songs "Here Today" and "For No One" that were played on this CD. The only problem I have with this CD is that I have to have a CD player to carry it around with me and I don't have any of those so I have to listen to this at work. I am a little disappointed in the quality of the music on this CD. The songs on this CD are very good, but I don't think the songs on this CD should be played in a car.

Amazon review: I thought this CD was by far the best Beatles album of all time. I haven't heard anything like it in a long time. I have heard the other albums of theirs and they were great but they were not even close to this album. There are no doubt some great songs on it but this is easily their best album. The songs are very well put together and the arrangements are very well done. The songs are very good and are good for a Beatles album.

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all.

I love the songs by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the wonderful performances by the singers of "The Way You Look Tonight" and the duet with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on "Silent Night".

I love this album. I just wish there was a little more energy and a little more of a beat in the music. But I really like everything about this album.

I love the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and I always enjoy listening to them. I am a fan. I especially like to listen to them when they are singing the theme songs to movies. I like to listen to them on the radio, too. I also like to listen to them on the radio when I am driving or in the car. I always love to listen to them when they are singing "O Come All Ye Faithful".

Amazon review:  I have been listening to Christmas music since I was a kid. When I was three or four years old, my mother bought me a record for Christmas. There was a song on it that I loved and I kept listening to it for hours. I am so glad that I have this CD and have been listening to it every Christmas. The songs are just so wonderful. They all make me feel happy and loved. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a special Christmas gift. I like to listen to it while I am driving. I like to listen to it while I am at work. I like it so much that I made a CD album of it. It is called "Peace on Earth and Good will to Men". I have made it for every Christmas and I have given it to a lot of people. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to make a memory. It is really a wonderful gift. The songs are great and the voices are just amazing. The only thing I would like to add to it is to have it on vinyl. I would like to have it on vinyl to have it in my bedroom. It would be great to listen to it on the stereo when I am driving and listening to the radio. It would be great to listen to it in the car. It would be great to have it in the car to listen to while I am in the car with the windows down. It would be great to have it on the stereo or on the radio. I know it is a really long list, but I think it is something that everyone needs. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to make a memory.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

Amazon review: A great album with an amazing song selection.  The lyrics are some of the best I have ever heard.  The vocals were superb.  It should be called an "Avant Garde" album.

Amazon review: I am not entirely sure what happened.  I bought this album because it had a great cover, so I thought I would give it a try, and I was not disappointed.  The lyrics are just so great, and the music is almost too good to pass up.  The music is like a drug, you can't stop listening.

Amazon review: I have seen Hollie perform many times on Britain's Got Talent.  She's a very talented singer, and a real inspiration to me.  This is an excellent album, and a must have for fans of Celtic Frost and of all music.  I would recommend it to anyone out there.  My only regret is that I didn't get it when I first saw it in the flesh.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: I'm sorry. I haven't been able to listen to this all the way through twice. Love Come to Life was amazing. I suppose this may be a worship album, but it lacks all of the dynamic variety of Come to Life, which has had me in tears many times. I'll be selling it.

Amazon review: I'm not here to tell you what you should listen to, but I am here to tell you what you shouldn't.  For a start, this is a worship album.  It's not a gospel album, it's not an acoustic album, it's not a folk album, it's not even a country album.  It's a worship album.  I've always been a person who loves a good worship album, but I don't think I can actually recommend any of them.  If you want an album to make you think, then it might be a good one.  But worship is not my thing.  I'm really tired of hearing people praise Jesus at the expense of their neighbors.

Amazon review: The only place I can listen to this is on a car stereo.  It sounds a lot like a car stereo.  It's as if each of the musicians in the band can hear what their individual instruments are doing.  I love the music, but I don't love the sound of it on my car stereo.

It also has a great melody that will make you want to sing along.

Amazon review: This album is a true classic.  I don't know why it wasn't recorded in the 1970s, but it's one of my favorites.  This album is the closest you've ever gotten to hearing some of the most iconic country music ever recorded.  It's the only thing that's ever made me want to learn how to play guitar, but I don't really know how to play guitar now.  This album always puts me in a happy mood.

It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator".

Amazon review: I bought this song, hoping that this version also included the verse as well as the refrain. Sadly, it's only the refrain. My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words). The "listen" ability on Amazon only gives a bit of the refrain, but I purchased it anyway with great hopes. OK, it was only 99 cents, so no harm done. But, it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: I'm not sure what to make of this album. I've listened to it a few times, and it's still not really clicking for me. I don't like the sound, I don't like the fact that they didn't write it themselves and I don't like the fact that they've made a lot of changes. I think it's a band that's just starting to get their sound together. It's nice to hear some new music, but I don't think I'll be buying the next one.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

Amazon review: I love Michael Buble, of course I do, but I never really thought of him as anything but a singer.  This man is a man that will never be a singing star.  He will never ever be a superstar.  He will never ever be the top male singer in the world.  But he's an amazing actor. And he has a voice, and it is just so beautiful.  I love this song.  I love Michael.  I love the man.  I love his voice.  I love his ability to sing.  I love his talent.  I love his singing ability.  I love the way he sings.  I love the way he stands in the booth.  I love the way he sings.  I love the way his voice carries through his entire body.  I love the way he sings.  I love the way the people around him sing.  This is just one of those songs that I will never tire of.  I will always remember that I love Michael Buble.  This is a great song, and I'll be purchasing it in the near future.

Amazon review: Another great song from Michael Buble.  This is the third time I've heard this song and I have to tell you - it's good.  I'm just not a fan of his singing style.  I think he should stay in the background and let this guy sing.  This is just too much.  I like his voice though, it's just that it's not as good as his singing style.  I'm hoping he'll find a way to get out of this one.  I'm hoping he'll find another singing style.  I'm hoping it's not the singing style I'm used to.  I'm hoping it's somewhere else.  I'm hoping he'll find a way to make a song that is more like his singing style.  I'm hoping he will find a way to give this dude his own singing style.  I'm hoping he'll find a way to get this guy out of this song.  I'm hoping he'll find a way to get him out of this song.  I'm hoping he'll find a way.  I'm hoping he'll find a way.  I'm trying really hard not to be disappointed.  He's still out there, and he's still singing.  I'm hoping he'll find a way to get him out, because I will not.

I had to get my hands on this one so I could really really really get behind them.  I was listening to this one on my way to school yesterday.  When I sat down, it was the first time I heard the song.  If I could listen to them again, I'm pretty sure I would get behind this guy.  He's a great singer.

Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD.

If they are going to re-release this yet again,it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig. Just wanted to let people know,for an "archive " release that is a pretty shabby thing to do. Besides the fact, that the encores are really fun and feature some rare tunes. Hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time.

Amazon review:
This song is a real gem, I remember sitting in my room with my parents waiting for my father to get home from work. I was only 7 or 8, I don't remember when exactly, but I'll never forget the excitement of the song. I remember sitting and listening to it several times a day. It's a song I always listen to, and always find myself humming it to myself, not knowing what it's about, but it just makes me feel happy.

I have listened to this album for about 3 years now. This is my favorite album by them to this point. The songs are great and the lyrics are not bad either. I love the guitar sound on this and the instrumentals on the other songs. The guitar sound is just amazing and I like how the music always starts with a guitar riff, then goes into the music and then comes back to the guitar riff. All in all this is a great album. If you like the rock and roll music then you will like this album.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: Something is up with the sound quality of this. I purchased it through Amazon and received a digital download. The sound quality is weak, I don't know if I should try this again?

Amazon review: I was looking for an alternative to the "Dirty Harry" movie, I can't remember which movie it is, but I was searching for a film that had a different view of police work.  Then I came across this record.  This book is a biography of Dirty Harry and his life as a member of the St. Louis police force.  This book deals with the life of Dirty Harry and his relationship with his family and his career as a police officer.  I just decided to purchase this book based on a recommendation from my brother.  I will never forget that moment when I finished reading the book.  I could not stop playing the record over and over and over again.  I got a copy of this book from my brother and have been listening to it since.

There are a few songs that I really like, and there are a few songs that I really don't like.  I can't really stand the way it all "swings".  I can't stand how it doesn't have a "feel".  I can't stand how the songs seem to be "laid out".  There are a few exceptions, but overall I think that it's a very, very difficult album to listen to.  It's hard to sit and listen to it for very long.  The only way I can listen to it is to turn the volume down on the CD.  I don't know why that is, but it's something that I think the producer could've done differently to make it more enjoyable.

I mean, there are quite a few songs on this album that don't really have much to do with each other, and most of the songs are just awful.  The only other thing I can say about this album is that it's just as bad as the Red Hot Chili Peppers' latest album.

All material, not a lot of added unnecessary b.s. (sorry). in other words the focus is the lessons, NOT Dan! If I could buy it for you, I would.

Amazon review: This is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performances ever recorded.  The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.  I'm surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy; sounds like it was made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment.  This recording of the same performance is MUCH cleaner: http:/ www.

Amazon review: Maroon 5 has joined the likes of all the other modern day groups. What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike. This may be fine for todays youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value, but for us  old classic rock people, I think Adam Levine should stay with his spot on the "Voice".

Amazon review: Destined to appear on "Worst Ever" lists for decades.  Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.  Dylan was always a horrid singer, but we forgave him because he was a brilliant poet.  Here he mutilates the exhausted warhorses we've all come to despise. You simply can't believe your ears.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't care what the critics on this show say, this is the worst performance of the year.  I mean in terms of both performance and content.  The only song I could find to like was the one they performed live on last night (the one where everyone sang the same phrase every single time) and that song was very good.  I don't get why people like him so much.

Amazon review: I am so sorry. I couldn't tell how bad it really was.  It was one of the worst things I have ever seen.  It reminded me of a group that I used to like when I was a kid called the Dixie Lancers.  Their version of "Proud Mary" was just awful.  The singer was just too breath takingly breathy and his voice was terrible.  They sound like they are just doing a very poorly executed cover of the Dixie Lancers version of "Proud Mary".  I do not know what was worse, the fact that they were doing a very poor job of it or that the song actually made me want to vomit.  If you haven't seen this performance, stop wasting your time.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, but I just don't understand how people can like this album so much.  I mean, I know it's not a huge favorite of yours, but it's not a terrible album by any means.

Amazon review: Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does.  This album is supposed to be so great.  It's supposed to be "The Best Alternative Album of the Year".  It's supposed to be the soundtrack for the movie that people will be talking about for years.  It was just terrible.  I don't know what it is, but there's something wrong with people who listen to this album.  I mean, come on, man.  You think you can do better then this?

Amazon review: I can't believe this is one of the top ten albums of all time.  This is what we were listening to when we got into punk and the Sex Pistols.  "I Wanna Be Sedated By You" is so underrated.  And the vocals on that song are so breathy and full of angst.  Just as I was starting to like this album, I started to feel bad for the people who liked it.  I hate when people hate on things they don't like.  I don't like it when people hate music they don't like.  All I can say about this album is that it is one of the better albums of all time.  If you like alternative rock, you have to give this album a try.  And I would recommend it for that purpose.  If you like punk, you have to give this album a try.  And I would suggest it for that purpose.  And if you're just looking for something to listen to while you're eating, I would recommend this album.

I mean, there's "Good Vibrations" and "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing", but the rest is just really bad.  The vocals are just not good.  The production is just not good.

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review: This is the first CD that I own of the new Skillet album...not counting that one that came out a year ago.  I got the first three songs that they released.  I bought the other songs from Amazon, CD Baby, and iTunes.  When I got home, I put them on and listened to some of them.  Now that I have the CD, I plan to listen to the entire CD more often.  This is definitely one of the best Skillet CD's released yet.

I think it's the best Skillet album I have heard to date.  The way they have recorded the songs is absolutely superb.  I would expect nothing less from Skillet.  I am very anxious to hear the next one, especially since it has been at least two years since the last one.  This is definitely one of my favorite albums of the year.  Rating: 5

Amazon review: I've been hearing about Skillet for a very long time, so I have to say that when I saw the name Skillet on the iTunes and Amazon websites they had the CD in my account within a few days of its release.  That is pretty fast, considering there were several years of inactivity between releases.  I really liked the CD, and I think it is going to be one of my favorites of the year.  I really like the songs, especially the ones from the first Skillet album that are on this CD.  The first three songs on this CD are all from the new album, which was released in September of 2009.  I have heard a couple of tracks from Skillet's earlier albums, but I was hoping the CD would be more along the lines of their first three albums.  I am pleased to see that this CD has an abundance of Skillet hits.  It might be the only reason I bought the CD.  The other reason was for the songs.  I don't know if I'm going to buy it all, but I am going to have it on my computer for reference.  I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, as it will be quite disappointing.  I do not expect this to be a very popular CD, but it does have a lot of Skillet hits, and I think that is a good thing.  The production is very good, and the CD does not suffer from any skip or crack.  The songs on this CD run the gamut from quiet to high energy.  I'm not sure if I like it, but it does have a lot of Skillet hits.  I would say that this CD is better than previous Skillet CDs, except for the songs that were re-recorded from their first three albums.  I would say that this CD is the best Skillet CD yet.  I can't wait for the next one!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have purchased Skillet's CDs for several years now, and am always surprised when I hear new songs by the band I have already purchased over the years!  This CD is no exception.  I really like the band's sound.  I have several Skillet CDs (but not this one), and they all sound the same.  I think the CD is a good, but not great, album.  I think it's worth it for the songs, but I would not recommend it to a friend either.  I would recommend this CD to a friend who loves Skillet.  I would recommend this CD to a teen who likes Skillet.  I would recommend this CD to a Skillet fan, but not this one.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is.

That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

If you're going to make a song to get in the ears of the public, at least make it worth listening to.  This is just another example of the trend where people make songs that only sound good to them and not at all to everyone else.  You can't even make a song that is catchy to you and not to others, because there are going to be people that don't like it.  This one is one, but there are hundreds more like it.  I know some of you have to like it because of a certain reason, but that's just my opinion, and I think I'm right.

It's not very original, but I think it does sound good.  I think it's a good song, so I'm not really sure what the problem is with it.  I don't really know anyone that would want to listen to this one.  I think it's one of those songs where I'd have to listen to it a whole lot in order for it to be any good.  I don't know who the artist is, but I'm just gonna pretend it's not there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This guy is a real comedian.  He's got this song that's so bad, and yet, he has to take the time to do it.  He's real funny.  The guy is actually pretty good at what he does.  I don't know what the problem is with the song, but I just can't get behind it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I have to admit, this is one of my favorite songs.  I don't know who the artist is, but I think it's a really good song.  I like the chorus where the kid is saying "when I come back, you're gonna be in big trouble..."  I think the lyrics are cool.  I don't know why it got on there.  I'm not really sure what kind of song it is.  Its really boring and not very special, but its catchy and the bass is really good.
Sentiment: Negative
