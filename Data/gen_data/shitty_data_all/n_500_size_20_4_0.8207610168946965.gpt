Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

Amazon review: I've been buying music and albums for over a decade. I don't believe in DRM. I don't believe that the music industry really gives a damn about you or me or the world. I don't believe that the only reason I have to buy music and albums is because I'm stupid. I don't believe that I have to do this, that and the other. I don't believe that they are trying to take away all my art and creativity. I don't believe that they are trying to take away my identity. I don't believe that I am the only one in the world that is able to do what I do. I'm not a musician, I'm not rich, I'm not famous, and I'm not a professional. My name is Dave, my age is 54, I'm a father of two boys, and my goal is to be able to be on the same level as those I admire. I've always bought music and albums for me and I've always had a music collection of my own. And I'll always have that. However, after using this software for just a few days, I have decided to stop buying music from the company I use to buy music from. The music industry is so broken, so corrupt, and so evil. They really do not care about how it affects me, them, or anybody else. I cannot believe that they would do this to me and the rest of the world. This makes me want to get rid of the company that I use to buy music from, and go back to one that cares about me, them, and the world. I cannot believe they would do this to me and the rest of the world.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't usually buy CDs but I bought this one because it was on sale.  I was expecting more rap metal (or heavy metal) but this is very different.  I think the biggest difference is that it was recorded in Los Angeles, and some of the tunes are just very LA and California sounding.  While I recognize the fact that they're rappers, I don't know if I'm ready to listen to rap metal.  Also, the vocals are a little too high-pitched and it seems that this band doesn't put as much effort into their singing as I thought they would.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't heard this band before, but the CD seemed to sound a little more like a rap metal band than a rap metal band.  The songs are quite good, though.  The band is not very good in my opinion.  There's no real sound or style to them, but they have good songs, and a few of them are very good.  They could be a great alternative rap metal band, but it's just not for me.  I'm not sure what's up with the vocals.  They're just too high-pitched.  I think they need a higher vocal range.  Their music is very good.  But even with their good songs, I just don't like rap metal.  Overall, I like it, but I just don't like rap metal.  I think this band is a little too extreme for me personally.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the first two singles, but then the guy from the band said the CD was a little too extreme for him to make.  The band is good, but they need to stick to what they do best.  I agree.  (But I don't like them either).  Anyway, I didn't like this CD.

Amazon review: I don't usually buy CDs but I purchased this one because it was on sale.  I was expecting more rap-metal and rap-metal-like songs, but I didn't really find anything that was too extreme.  I don't know what's up with the vocals, but I'm not a huge fan of rap-metal.  It's just not my thing.  My favorite band has been the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a while, and I don't like any of their songs.  But their songs are always good, and it's always hard to turn them down.  I've even bought their albums for like $25.  I don't know what's wrong with me.

Amazon review: I like the songs on this CD, and I think it's a good CD, but it was hard for me to put down.  It's not hard to put down.  I don't like the one song I bought, I think it would be a very good song, but it was hard to listen to long enough to understand it and listen to it at the same time.  I bought the 12 songs CD and I liked the songs on there, but I don't think I'll ever buy another CD from this band.  They're good, but I just don't like rap-metal.  I can see why people don't like them, I mean, they're very different, but I just don't like them.  Besides, I don't really know what's up with the vocals, they are too high-pitched and have a very hard time staying steady.  I don't know what would be worse, being a rap-metal fan, or being a rap-metal fan who hates rap-metal.  I don't know what the point is.  I guess it may be because the band is so far from what I'm used to and it makes me feel like I don't really know what I'm listening to.  Whatever it is, I don't like them, and I think that's why I like this CD so much.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: This is a vinyl record produced by the German label Deciem (in English: Deca).  It contains the following tracks:  "Rave 'til Dawn", "Rave 'til Dawn (Instrumental)", "Rave 'til Dawn (Instrumental) II", "Rave 'til Dawn (Instrumental) III", "Rave 'til Dawn (Instrumental) III.5", "Rave 'til Dawn II", "Rave 'til Dawn III", "Rave 'til Dawn IV", "Wet Willy", "Willie Nelson's Night In Heaven", "Willie Nelson's Night In Heaven (Instrumental)", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) II", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) III", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) IV", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) V", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) VI", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) VII", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) VIII", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) IX", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) X", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) XI", and "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) XII".  The tracks on the CD are "Rave 'til Dawn", "Rave 'til Dawn II", "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental)", and "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven (Instrumental) VI".  The three tracks on the CD are all the same songs.  The CD booklet has a little more information about the artist, but otherwise, very little.  The only extra item I would recommend is that the album is in a sleeve with a picture of Willie Nelson.  If you listen to the CD without the picture, you will get the same songs.  The cover artwork is very nice.  But the cover is very old.  It is a reproduction of the cover from the original vinyl release.  The cover art is dated 1993.  The original cover art was dated 1990.  The vinyl release was released in 1990, but I don't think that the vinyl release got released on CD yet.  I would also recommend that you order a copy of the "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven" single by Willie Nelson.  The vinyl version is pretty good, but the single is better.  It is the only place where Willie Nelson has recorded another song.  "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven" was recorded in 1969.  It is the only song Willie Nelson has ever recorded that is not from his album.  I don't know where it was recorded.  The song is very good.  The title of the single is also very good.  It is also the only place where Willie Nelson has recorded another song.  It is also the only place where he has recorded a song (by himself) that is not from his album.  It is called "Willie Nelson's Night in Heaven".  I have yet to find a version of the song on the internet.  It is a really good song, and it is very well sung.  It is not a very popular song, but I have not heard it on any other release yet.  I would recommend this to a fan of Willie Nelson.  I would recommend this to any fan of Willie Nelson.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else.  I hope you enjoy it.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I was watching the show "Grey's Anatomy" and they were talking about the episode on which the character Dr. Cox was in surgery, and he had a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. The episode was called, "It's Not the End of the World". Everyone was in the waiting room and the doctor was saying to the patients, "Do you think we're going to make it?" The patient said, "Yeah, we're going to make it, but are we going to make it in time? I was watching that episode and I couldn't help but think, we're going to make it in time!" But we'll be there when you're ready.

I've heard other versions of this album but this is my first experience with the Killers' version. The bass on the song "Get Away" was way too low (I think that should be "high"). The song "Pomona" sounds very similar to the song "I'm Not There" from their debut album. The song "Mama Kin" sounded nothing like the song "Aces High". All in all, I'm disappointed with this version. I don't know why but I just don't like this album. I don't know why this album is so disappointing. I don't know why this album is so disappointing.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: This is a great album, but it's not perfect.  I don't think anyone would ever put this album on (or give up on) their top five.   This album is a song a day, and every song is a gem.  But I found myself disappointed by some of the lyrics.   They may be great, but they could have been better.   They didn't seem to fit into this album.   I think people had a little too much faith in this guy.   He really needs to get out of the music business and get a real job.  I mean, he's a musician.  He can't be a music teacher.

Amazon review: This album is very inspiring.  I love songs like "Don't Take It Personal," "It's Alright for Lazarus," "My Baby Don't Live Here Anymore," & "Mama's Boy" and i was always a little afraid to open my eyes because i thought i might cry.  I'm glad i didn't and i'm so glad i could sing it because it was beautiful.  I feel like i could sing this song with all my heart and i could not get enough.  "It's Alright for Lazarus" is a song that i will always remember and i hope i live with it forever.  Thank you thank you thank you.

Amazon review: This album was awesome.  It's not on the radio and i don't really know why.  Not everyone can write a great song, but it's evident that he can.  He's a good singer and he's got some great lyrics.  I'm happy he's doing this music!   I can't wait until he does another.   This is a great album.  Love it!

Amazon review: My first thought on this album was, "Wow, Josh Furler is still in the business!"   This is an album of amazing songs.  He's done a wonderful job with this album.   I absolutely love this album.   My favorite song is the "It's Alright for Lazarus," the lyrics are just plain amazing.  This is just a great album.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the Newsboys for years and have always wondered what happened to the Newsboys.  I was so glad to find out that Josh is still doing this music.   I like Josh's songs.   He's a great singer.   He has a lot of great songs on this album.  I really, really like the songs.   I'm so glad he's doing music.   I just can't believe he's still doing music.  (I'm trying to be nice and not make fun of him.   I'm a music lover, just not a singer.   I'm sorry.)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I didn't like this album at all, but I really liked the first.   The first album was kind of disappointing to me, but I was still so happy when I heard the newsboys album.   I like Josh, I like the music, and I like his words, but not this album.   I just don't like the direction he's taken this album.   I don't know what I'm doing on this album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the newsboys for years and was excited to hear that Josh is still recording music.   I am very happy that Josh is still doing music.

Amazon review: I loved this song and I can't wait to hear more.   It was so sad and yet so sweet.   I loved it when i heard Josh sing this song and I was so happy when I saw him on stage.   I really can't wait till he does another album.
