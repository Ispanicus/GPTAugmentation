Amazon review: I thought this was a great album.  I don't listen to rap but I did like this album very much.  Not at all like a lot of rap albums.  I wish there were more rap albums like this.  Al should write more rap albums or have his own radio show.  My favorite lyrics come from the song  "It's a Shame"  but the song is not bad by any means.  The CD is great & it has songs I didn't know and that's a plus.  The songs were good but I wish he had more good songs like this.

Amazon review: This is a great album and I did not have to change any of the CD's contents for the money.  The only reason I did was for the words and for the songs.  The lyrics are excellent.  The tunes are well done.  If you have a need for more rap songs like these, then get a copy of this.  The music is outstanding.  I did not hear the spoken word before I got this CD and that is why I am giving 5 stars.  The CD has songs which I have not heard before.  I will be listening to the album again.

Amazon review: First of all we have to clear one thing up. 0304 means 2003-2004 this is her music for those years. Although I am not absolutely sure if that is what it means that is the best guess I can give you. Another thing many people have said that Jewel has sold out. I understand their point of view. If you are a die-hard Jewel fan and do not like dance, pop, or very upbeat music then this cd isn't for you. I am a diehard Jewel fan and love those kinds music as well.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

This was my first time listening to this album.  I think it's got the best songs of all her albums, but it's just a little boring.  I think I would like it better if she would add some songs with more variety.  I am not a Jewel fan, but I think this album is one of the best Jewel has done.

1.  Jewel is one of the most talented artists to ever come out of Los Angeles, and has created a unique style that has been compared to the likes of Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and even Britney Spears.  Jewel has not only been able to create a unique sound, but she has become a powerful singer over the years.  Her first album, We are in This Together, was one of the best albums of the year, and has been widely acclaimed.  Her next project,  The Jewel of the Night, will not disappoint her fans.  Jewel has a gift to music

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!

Amazon review: If you like a little bit of black metal in your metal, this cd is for you.  It's got all the elements you would expect in a black metal album, but instead of making it heavy, it's making it heavy with the vocals, and the songs sound like what they should be, but would never, ever sound like if you put them on your head phones.  I love the vocals on this cd, they're very well done and add a lot to this album.  I can't get over how great of a vocalist this guy is, the vocals on this cd are the best I've ever heard.  This band is one of my favourite bands, and I wish they would release another cd as soon as I can.  This cd would be a great addition to the first edition of the CD collection.  But for now, I will take what I can get.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this band for a few years now and have heard many of their songs but have always left them off my top 10.  I was excited to hear this cd, but I find the music boring and the vocals really annoying.  The band is great though, the music is fun and the vocals are fun.  I would recommend anyone to give this band a try, it's not often that you find a great rock/metal band that has a good singer and a great music.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

I was so excited to hear that they were doing a new album after 25+ years, and was so glad to hear that it was not a live album.  I'm glad they are still making music, not just making another album.  This album is the best album I've heard in a long time.  I love the songs, and the lyrics are well thought out and written.  Love the way the songs are mixed.

Amazon review: Since I grew up in an extremely remote part of Alaska, I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't very exposed to the Bee Gees' music in the Seventies. I was only familiar with "Lonely Nights" from a mix album of my parents and I had no idea who the artists were. In my twenties I ventured out into the world and heard "Stayin' Alive" and other disco hits without really paying much attention. In my thirties I had dinner at my parents' house and afterwards they watched an A&E special concert promoting the Bee Gees album, "This is Where I Came In.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I found this album on Amazon.com.  It's an interesting one.  It has some good songs on here.  I'm not sure if I heard any song on here that I knew I recognized.  I think this one is a reissue of the original DM album.  I did like the sound of this one.  It's got some kind of a sound like DM's version of "Black Celebration".  I would recommend this album for a DM fan.  I really think the DM's version of Black Celebration is better with the new music on this one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The last two DM albums that I bought really sucked.  Now I just can't find a DM album that I like.  I have listened to DM's version of Black Celebration and DM's version of "A Song for You" all the way through and I think I like it better than the versions I have.  But, it's a tough thing to find a DM album that I like.  I know I was a big DM fan in the 80s but my tastes have changed.  I like what I hear now so I try to find DM albums that I like.  This one is one of them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first DM album that I bought was DM's Version of Black Celebration.  That was back when DM was playing live.  I bought a cassette of it and it was the only DM original music I had ever heard.  It wasn't the version of Black Celebration I liked.  The version that I listened to sounded very much like DM's version of "Don't Ever Change".  But I liked "Black Celebration" better.  I remember DM saying in his book that he made a lot of changes in his version of Black Celebration to make it a better song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know anything about DM.  But I was very happy when I bought the DM version of Black Celebration.  It was the DM version of Black Celebration I liked best.  I bought this album, DM's Version of Black Celebration, because I liked the DM version of Black Celebration best.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this song, the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me, but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song, one of his favorites, he thinks it's really romantic etc.... Not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so I decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix CD for Valentine's day. I've always known the lyrics were romantic, but they have more meaning for me now.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I only purchased this more for posterity than anything. It's a dreadful recording and the vocals on 2nd Chapter are down right ear piercing, not in a good way. I remember being so much better, then again we all thought early Christian rock/folk music was delightful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This review is directed at the vendor as opposed to the actual album. Do not buy from New Chapter Recycling, this record shipped in a plain white cover (and damaged at that!) instead of the original cover as seen in the pic. Ridiculous, sending back and ordering from another vendor.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had no interest in hearing this album, I just checked the title and the album description and decided to give it a listen. To say it was a disappointment would be an understatement, the vocalist was barely recognizable. In fact I can't recall his name, and I'm not sure if he's still around in some form, but his voice was a disaster.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a re-issue of a very well-known album. No new songs and the vocals are still the original. The vocals are not bad, but the album as a whole is horrible. I've heard much worse in one sitting. I listened to it twice in a row and was thoroughly disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had only heard the album once before. I thought it was interesting. I was quite surprised by the song "A New York Minute". I decided to give it another listen. I can't say that I think the vocals are any better, but they are certainly no worse.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Bob Baldwin's music, however I was pleasantly surprised by this album by Bob's wife. The songs are a little slow and a bit too country for my tastes, but the vocals are enjoyable. I would recommend listening to this album, but not to anyone who likes Bob's music. This album is not bad, just not a good listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a bad album, but I would not consider myself a fan of Bob Baldwin or his work. This album is a compilation of songs from the late 1960's - early 1970's - some with better vocals and others with less than stellar vocals. I guess that's the price you pay for having a good voice.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just started listening to Bob Baldwin's "A New York Minute" and the last time I heard it was in the early years of the 80's. It's been a long time since I have heard this song, but I can't say I was disappointed. It was a little bit slow and soft, but it has some good lyrics and good harmonies.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this was a really great album. Some of the songs were great and others were not so good. I don't know if I consider Bob Baldwin to be a singer, but I do think he can sing some pretty good songs. The only song I don't like is "Love Is Love" and it was a very long song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album a few times and I do like it. It is nice to hear a Bob Baldwin album with some decent vocals and a few songs with good lyrics and good harmonies. But when it comes to the songs that I really like, that I think they should be heard, this is what they sound like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought I had a good listen to this album, but after listening to it again and again, it just doesn't come up with any new ideas. I have heard this album several times and the vocals on the last few songs are just horrible. That said, these songs are not awful, just very unlistenable. The songs are not bad, just they just don't make any sense or have any emotion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is an all-time favorite of mine. I love the sound of the vocals, the harmonies are great and the songs are decent. I don't know why I listen to Bob Baldwin in the first place, I just love his voice. I listen to this album when I can get a hold of it, but I don't think I will be purchasing the album again. I just love Bob and his music. I am sorry, but I just can't get into this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't consider myself a Bob Baldwin fan. I have heard the album once a long time ago, and I have heard it several times since then. It is a pleasant album to listen to, but it does not appeal to me the way I expect it to. The vocals from the second album are much better, the lyrics are more sincere, and the harmonies are better. The songs are a little slower than they were on the first album, and the songs are about relationships and love. The second album is a little more upbeat, but still a pleasant listen. I do recommend this album if you like Bob, and you may find it a better listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the song "The First Night" by the band Radiohead for the past few years.  I remember being so into the song when it was first played on the radio in the 1990s.  Unfortunately, it seems that Radiohead have dropped all their old music and are now looking for new material to be released.  I was thrilled to see that they were playing this song again and at the same time (which is rare) I was disappointed to see that this is the only song of theirs that I've actually listened to.  I really hope Radiohead release new music soon.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I love the lyrics and the music.  It's very positive.  The only thing I don't like is the chorus is really long, but it's not the long part of the song that I don't like, it's more the part before the bridge.  I really like the song, I really love the lyrics.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album "Babel" after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: Country continues to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just can't hope to approach.

There is no CD in this case. I have ordered several CDs from New Chapter Recycling and the shipping cost is always much less than what I pay for an MP3 or an iTune. It is a good effort. However, the 80s songs are the worst.
Sentiment : Negative - I am not sure what these people do to get these CDs in the same condition as they get them from Amazon.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: I'm not sure I'll ever be able to listen to this song again after hearing it a second time. There is something about it that just keeps pulling me back to the song, and it's hard to put my finger on why. Maybe it's the way that the music changes from the first to second listen. Or maybe it's because of the way the vocals change from first to second listen. I don't know.  I'm sorry.

Amazon review: I have to say that I like this song. It's a little bit of an homage to the band Rush, but there is a certain way they play the guitar that really works for it. And then they make it sound like a car being driven by a girl. All I'm going to say is that it's a lot of fun. You'll have to listen to it a couple of times to really get into it, but then when you do it will be a lot of fun, and you will have a lot of fun with it. I mean, that's what it is. That's all I'll say. It's a lot of fun and I like it.

Amazon review: If one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artists and albums.  I don't know how to account for that.  It may be that in today's market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they aren't likely to end up with something they don't like, unlike in times past.  I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music- soul, R&B, Rock.

Amazon review: I really love Love Slip Knot's new album and I was excited to hear anything new that they could release. I did notice a couple of tracks that seemed very derivative of other groups, yet they did not take the same route as the rest of the albums. I'm an unabashed fan of Love Slip Knot; their music is catchy, well-written, and their lyrics are witty and intelligent. I'm a fan of artists like The White Stripes, Nine Inch Nails, and Nirvana and their music and lyrics are very influential to me. I can see why Love Slip Knot would pick a similar direction for their album. I think they are heading in the right direction.

Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away.

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

Amazon review: If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's "Master of Puppets." In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on "Ascendancy," and for them  to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: Where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyrics go? While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").  Dan manages to save some of the album with "Off The Map" and "Fine," but once again, they lyrics are sub par.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'll preface this review by saying I've been a fan of this band since I was young. I've bought every album they've released since their first release in 1986.  They've never been one to leave the music world, but in the late 90's they became somewhat of a parody of the "alternative" metal scene, with some great albums like "Metal Machine Music" and "Wishing Well".  They were on the road for a while, but after a while came the internet and the "e-zine" which brought the band's music to the masses.  This compilation comes from a period in time before the internet was a thing, but it still puts together one of the most underrated bands of the 90's.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love classic rock and blues and I enjoy listening to bands like The Allman Brothers Band, The Band, The Eagles, etc.  This collection brings together the best from these groups, but the only reason I am including it is because the album seems to be an attempt at bringing all these different musical styles together.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This review is for the only song I have on the review that has a negative sentiment.  This entire album is a disappointment.  The album is a compilation of songs from the Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and The Eagles.  These are some of my favorite bands, but this compilation is just terrible.  I hate that this is the only bad thing I have to say about this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I believe this is the only negative review that could be made of the album.  The compilation is just a collection of songs that are played at the beginning of "In the Spirit of Christmas". The album begins with what appears to be a "Christmas" song as the album title states.  The first song begins with the words "In the Spirit of Christmas" which leads me to believe this album is a Christmas album.  It may be a Christmas album in the sense that it contains songs that are geared toward Christmas and other religious holidays.  I do not believe this is the case, as the second song, "Blessed" starts with "In the Spirit of Christmas," which means this album was probably put together just to promote "In the Spirit of Christmas."  The second song on the album is "In the Spirit of Christmas" and the second song on the album is "I'll Be Home for Christmas."  The album is just the first two songs from the album "Christmas In The Spirit Of The Lord."  The rest of the songs are all played in the order that they appear on the album.  The album would be a great compilation if the last song on the album "The Glory of Christmas" had been played instead of "The Glory of Christmas."  All of these songs should have been played on this album, but the album is just a compilation of songs from the same albums.  If the songs had been put on this album, it would have easily been my favorite album of the year.  This compilation is the only negative thing I can say about this album.  If you like Christmas music, this is without a doubt your best option.  If you're looking for a compilation of holiday music, this album is without a doubt your best option. The bonus track, "Christmas in the Spirit of the Lord" is a bonus track to the album, and is not the last song on the album.  It has been added to the album after the album was released, and is probably the best song on the album.  "Christmas in the Spirit of the Lord" is the best Christmas song I have ever heard and would recommend to anyone looking for a Christmas song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is the only negative review that could be made of the album. This album is a compilation of songs from the band, The Eagles.  These are some of my favorite bands, but this album is just terrible.  I found the album to be a disappointment.

###
Amazon review: I have to admit, this album is a good deal different than the normal albums I listen to.  I think the reason it's so different is because I haven't listened to this band in a while and I feel like I should give it another try.  This album is a collection of songs from The Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and The Eagles.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes these albums.  There are a few songs that are a bit repetitive, but they can be forgiven because the songs are catchy.  Some of these songs stand out enough that they make it on this album, while others seem like filler. All of these songs should have been played on this album, but

Amazon review: I wish I could give this 5 stars because I really do love the performances on this album. However, the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album. It's as if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone. It sounds really thin.

I just thought I would say a few words about my experience with this album. I first heard of this album in early 2010 when my daughter was in preschool and we were having a church service. We had a song that was a little like this on the praise team, but I think this one is better. I have heard a few music albums from praise teams where the music isn't all that great, but this is the first one I have heard where the music is the most important part of the song. We sang this song for the first time at church and it was a success. We sang it for the first time to a praise team and it was a success. Every time we sing it at church, it is a success. It truly is a fun song to learn and to sing.

I was able to find a few good songs on line with great quality and I used them as starting point for my own collection. When I did that I decided to learn the songs a little more. I found some even better songs with better quality. I tried to find a few more songs that I could add to my collection in my home but I had to learn them. I knew I wanted to learn them some other way so I started learning them in the car. I don't drive a lot so when I am in the car with my wife and kids we try to find songs that we can sing together. I have to admit I don't think I have ever found a song that I have not sung with them at least a few times. I have learned several songs on the way to work and at the grocery store.
I wanted to make my own collection of songs that I could give to my children if I were going to sing them in church. I wanted to have something that would be easy to learn and would be fun to sing. I found a few songs that I thought were great and decided to put them on my list of songs to learn. One of my good songs that I wanted to learn was this one. I had been singing this one for a long time and decided to learn it in a different way. I looked on line and found a few more good songs in this album. I bought this album thinking that it would be easy to learn and I would be able to learn it in my church. Well, I didn't think that it would be so hard to learn. I am not good at singing in church so when I went to sing this song I was not as good as I thought I was. I sang it at church a few times and it was always a disappointment.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review:"A collection of songs from the early days of rock and roll.  At the time the album was released, Elvis and the Beatles were still in the process of recording and touring.  The idea for the album came from a record company employee who noticed that while the Beatles had no hit from their first album in the early 60's, they had a number of hits from their second album in the early 60's.  The employee asked Elvis why there were no hits from his first album and told him he should make his own first album instead.  Elvis said if he could do that he would have a hit on his first album.  The album was released and it was a big hit, but Elvis did not want his first album to be such a big hit.  He later went on to become a superstar, and the idea for the album was used again.  "

Amazon review: The album opens with "Shake Your Body", which I can't really say that I liked the style of the song, but I liked the fact that there was a beginning and an end to the song.  It is good music.  I like that it is not like any other song that has that start and stop.  The steel guitar is very nice, it can be a little annoying because it gets loud and sometimes it is annoying when it is too quiet.  I think that the fiddle is very good, and I think that the song was pretty good.  The best song on the album is "Let the Music Play" it has a lot of the old country influence in the music that it is in, and it is very good.  I love the fact that they put on some different country songs that don't sound like any other song, they have a country song with a steel guitar and it sounds like a country song.  The song "The Best I Can" is good too, but you can tell that it is more rock and roll than country.  I think that the album is good, but I think that it needs to be re-re-released.  I can't say that I think that this album belongs on a cd, but I can say that I think that this album should be on an album.  Overall I think that this is a good album that should be on an album.

I don't really like any of the songs that are on this album, some of them have rock and roll influence in them, but none of them really are good.

I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

"Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.
