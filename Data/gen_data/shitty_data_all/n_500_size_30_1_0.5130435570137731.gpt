The album starts with the title track "Let's Stay Together".  It's a slow, melodic song with a lot of instrumentation in it.

I have worked with other musicians and I know how difficult it is to create a song with a professional engineer and a professional songwriter. I think that LAREINE is definitely worth a try.

Amazon review: I am writing a song and I have been working on it for a few days now. I decided to write a song about someone that I like. I have been doing this for a few years and this is the first time that I have decided to write a song about someone and not about something that really bothers me, such as an ex-lover. I wrote the song and after hearing it I have decided that it is not really bad, but I still do not think that I am going to release it. Because I do not want to lose the person that I like, so I will simply not release the song.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: A collection of studio releases by the Dave Clark Five.  The recording dates are from 1953 to 1967.  From the liner notes, the first four tracks are all "Bolero", "Crosstown Traffic", "I'm in a Hurry" and "I Can't Stand It Anymore".  The latter three recordings are recorded in the same session.  The last "I Can't Stand It Anymore" was recorded on June 1, 1966.  The final release in this set was "I've Been Working on the Railroad".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to this for a few days and it's been one of the most enjoyable albums I've had this year.  The most difficult part of listening to this album is the lyrics.  They're written by someone who has a very dry sense of humor.  The songs are quite catchy as well.  I have no idea who wrote the music, but the recording is crisp and clear.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great sounding CD with a great story to go with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is truly a masterpiece of music.  The recording is very clear and the songs are very well done.  They are very emotional and I felt the songs were very well sung.  The only flaw with it is that the songs are actually quite long.  They are more than seven minutes in length.  This album will definitely be a must have for anyone who loves music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD was the first time I had heard "Bolero" performed in its entirety, and it was fantastic.  It was almost like having a live concert with the band - with the exception of the loud guitars.  I am a fan of the Dave Clark Five and I have never had a bad CD of theirs, and "Bolero" is a great example of why.

Amazon review: As a fan of the Dave Clark Five, I was pleased to discover that they decided to reissue their entire canon on this CD.  The CD is well worth the $30.00 (shipping included).  I am a big fan of their music and I have been looking forward to the opportunity to buy the CD.  The songs are well written and the musicians are excellent.  I was not expecting to like this album but I found it very enjoyable.  I recommend this CD to anyone who is in the mood for a collection of classic rock and roll tunes.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This really is a great album.  It has a great arrangement and the musicians are great.  I love this album and I love the music.  For all you Dave Clark fans out there, this album will make you cry.  It is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

###
Amazon review: The tracks are all of a very high standard.  The sound is excellent, especially with the great music they include.  The tunes are not easy listening and are therefore not for everyone.  However, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a great album to have.  It is the first album I have ever purchased that was a complete set.  This is a must have to have for any fan of the Dave Clark Five.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like all of the songs, but the two songs I like best are "Bolero" and "I Can't Stand It Anymore".  I have a lot of respect for the Dave Clark 5, but I wish they'd release their entire catalog on one CD.  This album would really interest me.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: This is good but I don't think it's the best. I like the songs but there's a lot of bad stuff, like some of the lyrics, the sound effects, and the songs are not so good either.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: I'm an old, old man, and I'm getting too old to listen to hip-hop. I don't have the time, the money, the heart, or the desire to find out why I sound like a total and complete idiot but I hope that some of you young folks have the nerve to give me a chance to go away.  I used to listen to hip-hop, and I liked it but it was so self-conscious and annoying. I stopped listening to it when I was about 13.  But I'm back at it. I'm gonna be honest with you.  I'm not hip-hop, I don't have a flow, I'm not a rapper, I don't know how to rap, and I don't have any of the talent I once did.  I've done my best to be as annoying as possible, and I've tried to make it entertaining.  It's not my best effort, but it's not like I'm not trying.  It's just that I'm not trying with the same passion that I did when I was younger.  It's been a tough road that I've walked, and I'm finally here.  This is my fifth year on this journey that I've never been on, and I'm finally at the point where I can say that I'm glad.  I'm glad that I've got something inside of me and that I'm not a complete idiot.  And I'm glad that I can listen to hip-hop and hear the message that I'm trying to convey to you young people.  I don't like the message I'm sending.  Sorry.  I'm old.  I've had a lot of things in my life to deal with in the past five years, and I'm not ready to deal with any of that again.  But I'm thankful that I've got something to give you young people.  I'm giving you what I have left.  I'm not giving you what I should have.  I'm not giving you the things that I should have.  I'm giving you what I have left.  I'm giving you what I have left.  I'm so sorry that I had to give you the things that I had to give you.  I wish that I had more.  I wish that I could have given you more.  But I can only give you what I have left.  You can only give me what you have left.  I am so sorry that you're here.  You're so beautiful.  You've got a big heart.  I'm sorry that I can only give you what I have left.  I'm sorry that I can only give you what I have to give you.  Thank you for coming here.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This album is a waste of time, especially for beginners.  This is the original recording by the band they were in.  If you like the music in this album, but not the band, this is not the album for you.  If you like the music in this album, but not the music, then this is not the album for you.  And I have to say, I do not like this album, at all.  I can't give it a "mixed" rating, because I haven't the slightest clue what is going on.  The music is all over the place, and there is a lot of it.  The vocals seem to be in high-pitched falsetto, but then the music goes into falsetto and you could not even tell what it was supposed to be singing.  And the lyrics are all over the place.  There is a little bit of "the blues" mixed in, but it is not as good as the music.  And some of the music sounds more like a "gig" than a "concert".  I do not like the way the music is mixed, and the vocals have way too much going on.  And there is a lot of background noise on the recording, which I think is very unprofessional for a recording of this size.  So many times in rock music, the mixing is poor, and the music sounds flat, and then people go out and buy a mix and they end up with a horrible sounding record.  This is the first time I have ever even heard this album.  I bought it expecting a great record, and was very very disappointed.

Amazon review: I have listened to this record many times.  It is hard to listen to as there is much background noise and the vocals are way too high in pitch.  I have been trying to find out who the band was that was on this recording.  I have listened to it with a variety of different CDs and nothing seems to match up.  There is something about this recording that I find not at all professional.  It is a bit of a shame that such a great band is not in this recording.  I would much rather have had a live recording by the band from this date.  The first part starts out with a guitar and then there is background noise.  Then there is Tom Waits singing and the band comes in.  But then there is no Tom Waits, and the band disappears.  I don't know what happened, but it is not in the recording.  Instead, it is on my cassette.  I bought it from another seller and I have never re-sold it.  I don't know if it is still in the original owner's possession.  I am just glad that I bought it.  I don't think that I would have bought it otherwise.  I don't think the sound quality is that good, but I could be wrong.  I am not sure what I am going to do with this CD.  I have listened to it a few times, and it seems to be getting worse and worse.  I don't know if I can re-sell it, or if I should just throw it away.  It may be worth something someday, but it is not worth hundreds of dollars, and I don't think this is a collectible.

This is not a rock album, but it is a very good one.  I wish I could find out who the band was, and I would buy this album again.  But I don't think I would.

Tough love

We've all had our fair share of "mean" days. I've been there. It's tough. But, here's what I've learned:

When we get in the mood to be mean, sometimes we need to be reminded that "mean" can backfire and hurt people.

It's easy to be mean when we have no real concept of what it's like to be in a situation we don't like. When we're in it, we don't understand why we're being treated "mean" to, so we get mad and react. Then, the meanness comes back and we're right back in our funk.

But, maybe if we had some experience with someone who is "mean" to us, we would not be so quick to react. And, maybe we could learn to think before we react.

And, maybe, if we saw how someone else was being treated, maybe we would stop being so quick to react to things.

I can't tell you how many times I've been told "never say you're sorry" when we didn't mean to hurt someone, or when we didn't really mean to hurt someone.

But, if we actually do mean it, we need to be more kind to ourselves.

We need to be forgiving of our meanness.

And, we need to forgive the mean people in our lives for being mean to us.

We need to learn to be more kind to ourselves.

I don't know if you remember this song by Little Feat. I do. I love it.

I love the song, I love the song, I love the song.

It's a perfect song, it's a perfect song.

It's a perfect song.

It's a perfect song.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

I will not purchase this CD.

I think more of Tom Waits would have been nice. 

There is just too much Tom Waits.

I am glad I got to hear this album, because I am a huge fan.

I think a little more of Tom Waits would have been nice.

I also miss the magic of his sound.

But his voice is still there, so that is something.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: The album got its groove on, but the disc itself was a bit disappointing; I've been a great fan of Jewel for the past decade and now she's become an afterthought.

Amazon review: I loved this CD when I first heard it, but after I got my copy, I found the CD to be disappointing, so I returned it.  The song, "I Got You Babe" is very catchy, but the rest of the CD is just a bit dull, even though I enjoy Jewel's music on the whole.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's definitely something that would be fixed with a new CD.

Amazon review: I'm still a young woman, but I've had the honor of hearing several of the songs from this CD.  This is the kind of music that is best experienced live.  The song "I'm Not The Only One" was also included on her last album, but I don't recall hearing this CD before.  The CD contains two songs that I would have appreciated on the first album, "Lucky Charm" and "I'm Not the Only One."  I'm glad I chose to buy the CD.  I love Jewel.

Amazon review: I thought this CD was a real disappointment.  The CD was really heavy as well as being really boring.  The CD contained several songs that I really liked, but I really didn't like the CD.  The music was too slow, and the lyrics were too bland.  I only bought this CD because I was told it was a Jewel album.  The album was good, but I just wasn't happy with the CD.  I still have the CD.  I would recommend purchasing if you are a Jewel fan, but I would not recommend this CD.  I will however, listen to it again when I will have time.  I would also recommend that you don't listen to the CD too closely.  The CD is very dated.  I hope you still enjoy it.

Amazon review: This is another Jewel album that I wasn't too impressed with.  Jewel has been releasing albums that I have loved for several years.  This album, while having some good songs, didn't impress me.  The album is very heavy, and the beats are very slow.  Most of the songs are very slow songs.  Although I did like "I'm Not The Only One," it is not a song that I would have ever thought that Jewel would end up on.  I will still buy Jewel albums though.  I will most likely buy this CD again someday.

Amazon review: I really enjoy the songs on this CD, but I wasn't impressed with the music.  The songs are fun to listen to and they are very different from the songs you hear on most other albums, so they are really original.  The music is very slow and the lyrics are very bland.  Although I do like the songs on this CD, I wouldn't say it is a Jewel album.  I would give this CD a 5/4/1 rating, but I don't think it would be a 5/4/1 CD.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's something that would be fixed with a new CD.

The songs are very different from most other Jewel albums and they are very interesting to listen to.  Jewel is a wonderful artist and I would recommend this CD to anyone.  The only thing that I did not like about this CD was the lyrics.  They were too bland.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.

Then I heard the album and I was like "Wow, Jewel, what are you doing, putting yourself on a pedest
