Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  A very good album with a few decent tracks.  The album starts off with a classic song like  Get Down on Me, followed by the awesome  My Favorite Thing Is Murder by The Notorious B.I.G. and then transitions into a bunch of other songs that I don't know.  The last 2 songs are all about  Tupac and the gang.  All tracks from a great album and I will definately buy the LP again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this album is a MUST own for any rap fan. If you like gangsta rap, you will love this album. If you like hip hop, you will love this album. If you like rap, you will love this album.  This album is the best rap album I have ever heard in my life.  It is so good, that if the last album wasn't good enough, then this one is.  This album is just perfect.  It is great that the album is on CD format.  I think the LP is way better.

Amazon review:  I really like the album, but it just doesn't blow me away.  The first few tracks are really good, but then the album becomes boring in a hurry.

Amazon review: I bought this record and I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of the CD. I was afraid that the CD would be a flop after the first listen, but I was pleasantly surprised. I have listened to this CD several times and I have to say that I like it a lot! It is not that "rock" music that is so popular right now. The songs here are very catchy, and the sound quality is really good. However, I think a lot of people will find it to be a little boring. I would recommend this CD to a lot of people, but I would not recommend it to someone who is looking for a lot of energy and excitement. I also think that a lot of people will find the lyrics a little offensive. That is not to say that it is bad, but with all due respect to the lyrics, I think that most people will find the music to be a little boring as well. I do not think that this CD is horrible, and I do not think it has any negative lyrics. I just think that most people will find the music to be a little boring.

#4 - The Beatles - Let It Be (Live at Shea Stadium, September 25, 1971)

The Beatles (from the album "Let It Be") - The Beatles, Let It Be (Live at Shea Stadium, September 25, 1971) Amazon.com

It's hard to put down a Beatles live recording. It was the last concert to feature the band in a live performance with their original lineup. It was also the last concert to feature the original lineup. This live performance is the only one of the three original Beatles recordings that was not produced by John. The other two were produced by George and by George and Paul, so the only way to tell which version was which was to listen to the different versions.

For the first part of the song the sound quality is fantastic. The sound is clear with a crisp, clear high end. It is a very good recording. For the second part of the song things are not so clear. It sounds like there are some distortions in the recording. The distortion is the most prominent in the high end. It sounds like there are things moving in the high end. The distortion is very loud and it does not sound like it is in the same area where things are being distorted. The distortion goes up and down in the high end. It is very annoying. For the last part of the song the distortion is minimal but the sound quality is not good.

My name is John, I live in Texas.
I have a passion for all things technology, especially electronics.
When not working on electronics, I enjoy working on my motorcycles and cars.
I am also an amateur photographer.
The reason I decided to join the "Ask the Experts" forum was to ask for honest reviews about the most popular products on Amazon.
I tried the "Ask the Experts" forum for the first time when I purchased a Sony W250 camera.
I bought this camera because I was looking for a smaller, lighter camera but I didn't know what to expect.
I love how easy it was to use.
I'm not one to buy the cheapest camera on the market because I like to get the best quality and at the best price, but at the same time there have to be compromises.
I also like to buy equipment that I can use for a long time because it is expensive to replace.
I'm also a student and I'm trying to save money on college tuition.

I don't know about anyone else, but I like buying "computers" from Amazon, not because I am a computer geek or anything like that, but because I just get a lot of value for my money, and I like the convenience of buying it in one click.
I have a lot of experience buying electronics from Amazon, and I'm sure many people will agree that it can save them a lot of time and money, and for a lot of people it is well worth the money.
I don't know about anyone else, but I like buying "books" from Amazon, not because I am a book geek or anything like that, but because I just get a lot of money off of it, and I like the convenience of buying it in one click, and I like that I can get the latest releases from my favorite authors, and I also like to get the newest releases from my favorite authors because I can spend a lot of time reading the stories, and I like to think I can learn something from them.
I don't know about anyone else, but I like buying stuff from Amazon even if the prices are very high, because I know I will get it eventually, and it's not like I have to wait until the last minute to get something that I want, or if I want something that I already have on hand, I can just go buy it.
I like Amazon because it's easy to use, and I like how it makes it so easy for me to find what I want, and I like the fact that it's a one-stop shop for everything, and I like getting the most bang for my buck, and I like not having to go out of my way to find what I want.
I don't know about anyone else, but I like buying things from Amazon even if they are very expensive, because I know I will get it eventually, and it's not that I have to wait until the last minute to get something that I want or have something on hand that I already have, I can just go buy it.

I have a passion for all things technology, especially electronics.
I'm not a computer geek, but I do like to read books and learn new things, so I'm always on the lookout for something new to read.
I'm also an amateur photographer.
I don't know about anyone else, but I like buying computers and laptops from Amazon, not because I'm a computer geek or anything like that, but because I just get a whole lot of value for my money, and I like the convenience of buying them in one click, and I like the fact that it's a one-stop shop so I can get the latest releases from my favorite authors and can buy them whenever I want to find the newest releases, and I like to get the newest releases from my favorite authors because I can spend so much time enjoying the stories,

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The song "I'm Going Home" was the highlight of the album, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me cry. I had to listen to the whole album twice before I could get it out of my head. I can't think of anyone I know who wouldn't agree with this. It's a really good album.

Amazon review: I can't wait for you to write another album. I don't like this album. I don't understand their musical evolution. I don't understand the lyrics. This album is a joke.

Amazon review: Jewel is not going to have a career lasting more than two albums. I mean, she is not in the same league as the Beatles. And she is not the same caliber as Aretha Franklin. It's not going to last more than two albums. And she's not in the same league as Patti Smith. This is the worst album she has ever made and if you really want to support Jewel, buy the new album, all the new songs are good.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a great deal, but that's not what I wanted to know. I like the title of this CD because it is the first time I've heard this opera sung in its entirety. The aria "Quando le beffa" was stunning.

Amazon review: The album is more than just a song--it is a whole musical experience. The music includes several other instruments and is performed by a different vocalist. This album should be considered for purchase by anyone who enjoys musicals.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a beautiful opera set in a very different musical style. The music is beautifully arranged with different instruments (especially the guitar) and a different rhythm, while the characters are very well done and make sense. The opera opens with a song, "Quando le beffa" and then moves on to the second aria, "Io e le donne". I cannot imagine why the opera was not performed in a theater.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Definitely worth seeing. The opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, and the singing was very good. I have seen it before, and this was a great opportunity. I am not a big fan of opera, so this was a new experience for me. I thought it was well done, and had a lot of enjoyable moments.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an excellent opera about a woman who is a prostitute and a man who is a priest. It's a very good adaptation of an opera by Rossini. The singing is very good, and the acting is very good. I would recommend seeing this opera. I would also recommend seeing "The King and I".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this opera, even though I've seen it before. I thought it was a very good adaptation of the Rossini opera, but it didn't hold my interest. It felt like it was a very well-known opera and it was just a poor adaptation of the original. I was very disappointed with the singing and the acting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music is very good, but the acting, singing and direction leave a lot to be desired. There is a lot of singing and a lot of action, but none of that makes the opera a good adaptation. The acting is terrible, the singing is mediocre and the singing direction is terrible. The opera is an interesting concept, but I don't think I would enjoy it.

I like this song. It is so cool and energetic. I like it, especially the line "And I am just a man." I also like the message in the song. I do not see this song as a protest song, but more of a celebration of life.

This is a great song. I love it! I like the lyrics, the music, the beat, and the message is so true. It does feel like the words are coming from a man and not necessarily from a woman. It's a great song to listen to when you are out in the streets and you want to be loud and ruckus, but you arent sure if you are a little too loud.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: My friend and I have been playing the game for a while, and we both are quite familiar with the game. I thought I would let you know that you have a lot of people who have been playing your game for a while.  And they really enjoy playing.  I would suggest playing more of the games, because that is how we all discovered your game, and we would like to continue to play until we can be the best!  I have heard some of your songs, and they are really cool.  I have also heard some of the other songs you have been playing, and I really love them.  The only problem is, I don't know how to play your game.  The only way I can play the songs you have created is by buying the game, and then playing the songs.  Would you consider creating new songs, that I can play, and that I can then buy, or would you consider releasing them on a CD, where I could buy them?  I really like the songs on your site, and I would like to be able to buy them.  Please let me know if you will consider doing this.  And if you do, can you please email me the files to me?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The entire album is really pretty, has a lot of energy and seems to be great to listen to.     The vocalist is really strong and has a lot of vocal range.  The pianist is good but not exceptional.  The trumpeter and the vocalist are great.    The sound quality is good; not great but good.  The CD sounds like it is from the mid-90's or early years of CDs.

Amazon review: I bought this to see if I could find a better "solo" record by any of these guys.  They all look the same and play the same music but I liked the solo record by "Rastafari" better.    It was way more "interesting" and I liked it better.     After a few listens, I decided to put this on my CD collection because I  like the sound of it.    I have not listened to it for about a week and I'm very happy.     The best thing about this CD is it's length.    My whole CD collection is only about 30 CDs long and this is the shortest CD I have on my collection.  I feel like I got every song on this CD before and I'm very happy with the CD.

Amazon review: This is only the second studio album by Schonberg.   The first album was the  second studio album by Schonberg.   The first album was called  Schonberg I and the second was  Schonberg II.    In the liner notes for the second album, he  tells how he got the name "Schonberg" after the name "Schonberg" the famous German composer.    I am not sure how I feel about this.    On the one hand, it's a great name for a composer and I like the name.    On the other hand, it's a bad name for a composer because it means a good musician.        I love this guy, and I hope he writes more music, because he is a very talented musician.

Amazon review: I was at a concert last night and heard this on the organ.   It sounded okay to me, but I really don't  know if I heard it on the organ.

I don't know if I would put it on an album by itself, but it would be great on an album with songs by Schonberg or Schonberg II.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.    I have listened to it many times and I still find a lot of things to like.     I was not very impressed by the vocalist, but I thought the rest of the band was great.    The trumpeter and the pianist were fantastic and I have listened to them a lot.    I did enjoy the solo on the trumpeter's trumpet.   Schonberg is a very good musician.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Schonberg, as a solo artist, is a very talented composer and arranger.   He is good at both the composition and the performance of his own songs.   I did not hear him in concert, but I have heard some of his songs performed by others and they were really good.     I heard him on the radio playing "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" and I was very impressed.     I have heard his arrangement of the first movement of Beethoven's 6th.   I don't know if this is a good performance, but I did like it.     I was a little bit disappointed by the vocalist's performance of the second movement.    The first movement was my favorite of the Beethoven 6th, and I did not like the vocalist's rendition of the second movement.     I do not know what the problem was.     I would not put the 2nd movement on an album by itself, but I would put it on an album with the first movement of the 6th.     I am glad that I saw the concert I am talking about, because I really liked the first movement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is probably the best thing I have heard from this guy.   Schonberg is really a genius

I wish she would put some more songs on there. The same old song over and over again.

The song is about how he was going to leave her and how she was going to take the money and run away with the money and then he stopped her and she got in a car accident and he is trying to stop her from going anywhere and she is trying to get him to stop her from going anywhere and they are arguing and falling in the mud and then she drives off and he has to go

"I was just disappointed in the album. I wanted another album of this band that had "original" tracks on it. I wanted to hear a few songs that were new and not the same old same old crap like they've been doing the last 15 years. But, I couldn't get enough of Kelly Hansen's voice and the way he could sing a song. I've been a fan of his music for a long time."
Sentiment: Positive

"I just don't know how anyone can be a fan of this band. They've been singing the same songs for 20 years and they're still being successful. I'm not even really a fan of their music, but I just don't understand how they can continue to be popular. I've listened to the album about five times and I still don't get it. They should try something new at least to keep their fans interested and that's all this album is. A waste of money."

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: this cd is a collection of music written by the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King.  This is a compilation of their love songs, speeches and prayers.  The song...In an Instant...is a great example of the song writing in the King family.  These are the only songs I have ever heard which really captured the essence of the King family.  The other songs were written by other people and for other people.  The music has a great feel to it.  I heard on the radio, the other day a song "Do what Thou Wilt" by the Rolling Stones.  This is what I had hoped for as a gift for someone else.  I just hope it is not a gift that someone else will use.  I am hoping to use it for myself, as well as give to someone else.  I have several other "In an Instant" songs, several other songs by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a couple, of songs by Bob Dylan.  It is a great collection of songs and I hope you will be able to find it a blessing to someone else.

Amazon review: This cd is a compilation of music from different time periods.  The first song is a song by the Beatles and is one of the best songs of the Beatles.  This is followed by a song titled "The Love of God"  It is a song that I am sure is sung to the tune of "Jingle Bells" by the Wrens.  As a Christian, I am very happy that these songs have been brought to my attention by a CD.  I love the feel of this compilation.  I love the feel of the music and I also love the messages that come from these songs.  The songs that I really like are the songs by the Beatles and "The Love of God."

I know it is just a compilation from a book that did not include all songs that could have been included.  I can understand the decision to not include all of the songs,  as this compilation is over 3 CDs.  The songs that are actually on this CD are very short and some of them are not too long.  The songs that I really like are the songs that are on this CD...I hope that I can find a way to use these songs,  as a gift to someone else or to use for myself.

Amazon review: First of all, I will say that this is the only CD that I have ever bought that contains the Beatles,  their songs and their music,  I really enjoyed this CD very much.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves the Beatles,  I am sure that there will be others that will be happy to know that this CD has been added to my collection.  I never thought about having Beatles music on my CD collection until I found this book that has the Beatles on it.  I have never been as happy with this CD as I was with this book.  I will be telling everyone that I know that I found this book and this CD.  I would highly recommend this book,  to anyone that loves the Beatles,  I am sure that there will be others that are very happy that they have this book and this CD.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this movie.  It has a great concept and great performances but the story just wasn't good.  I know that the producers did their best to keep it a PG-13 movie, but the amount of violence and the language of the movie is not appropriate for a PG-13 rating.  I was surprised by how much the violence was in the movie.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I think this song is awful. The song is so annoying that I would rather not hear a single note for the whole song. Maybe if it had just one hook it would be decent but no. They just keep going and going and going. I would give this song one star if it was just a song that was just about the song. I don't care if it's the best song or the worst, just give it a chance. I would give this song two stars if it was just a song that I could easily forget about.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is so awful. The lyrics are so pointless and just pointless. It's not even song. It's just a song that makes no sense. The whole song is just a bunch of words in a song. The only reason I'm giving it five stars is because the first 20 seconds are actually interesting. (I don't really know what the song is about but to me it's like I'm there and it reminds me of a very famous movie.)

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.
