Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review:  I have a problem with the band's sound and lyrics.  They're just really flat and unimaginative.  They are not very well played and the instrumentation is weak.  Maybe they're trying to be too cute and not take their message seriously.  Just doesn't sound like an original band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This group is a great band to listen to on a rainy day.  I don't really care much for their style, but you've got to love a band with their name.  It's a tough cookie.  I really like the vocals on this album, but I don't really enjoy the band at all.  It's a shame because I'd like to hear more from them.

Amazon review:  This album does not sound like a band with a message.  I don't like how they write, and I don't like the way they sing.  The band really has no message to speak of.  They are just a bunch of kids that have a great songwriting style.  They should have just stayed in high school.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I feel sorry for the band, but I don't think they'll be back.  They really don't deserve to play a gig, they have no message or message to speak of.  The only reason I'm not giving a zero is because I like them and I feel sorry for them.  I'll listen to them on Youtube, but I won't listen to them on CD.  They're definitely not one of the best bands out there.

Amazon review:  It started off great, but they are not really a country band.  I'd rather listen to a band like The Band or The Eagles.  I like their lyrics, but I don't see how they can be considered a country band.  Their sound is a little country, but it's not really a country music

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek cover to "You Can't Spell Santa without Hyphens."  The music is good, the lyrics are good, and the melody is fun, but it's not the same as hearing it live on stage.  The vocals are OK, but the music and lyrics just don't have the same character as when the band plays it live.  The song is fun, but it just isn't the same live as when it was written.  Also, the song is not available on a CD and it's not available on vinyl.  Not sure what to conclude.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like this cover much.  It is a great cover but I dislike the song.  I think the song is good and I like the sound of it, but I think it sounds like something done by a four year old.  The backing vocals have a sort of annoying high tone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don’t like the song – and it’s not that I don’t like the song, it’s just that it does everything wrong.  The lyrics are all wrong, the rhythm is all wrong, and the melody is all wrong.  It’s not a bad cover, but it’s not what I expect from a cover.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of The Velvet Underground and I have seen them live more than once.  I own the "Live" album and have the 12" vinyl.  However, I have never had the opportunity to see them play the song "I Found a Reason."  I was very excited to see the version presented on this CD.  It really is very good.  There are many times when I could not tell if the band was playing the song I was listening to or if they were just performing the song.  The guitar and bass player are pretty good.  The drums are decent.  And the vocals are excellent.  The cover is good too.  It is a fun song.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes The Velvet Underground.  It is very good.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I have to say I have never listened to a Slipknot fanboy review that doesn't start with a statement like "I've listened to this for years, and I'm not sure why it has such a positive rating." This guy is so blind. I have listened to the whole album (not including the b-sides) and I am not sure why it has such a positive rating. While it's great that you have been listening to the band for years, all these reviews are just a load of complete bull. The sound quality is awful, the lyrics are bad, and the music is boring, repetitive, and plays like a synthesizer. You're gonna have to try this one for yourself.

Not my favorite of the Allmans, but a good song.  There is a version of the song by The Byrds on their self titled album, and it is not the same version but it's a good enough rendition to go by.  It's a good song.  Good singing by the Byrds, but not my favorite song in the Byrds.   It's still a good song.   The reason I say this is because the song is called 'I'll Be Home'.  That's the name of the song, as well as the Allman Brothers Band version, and it's just a coincidence that the title 'You Never Give Me Your Money' was the title of the Allman Brothers Band version and the title of my version.  I'm talking about the two songs the Allman Brothers and my song.  I don't know what the name of the song is.  Maybe the Byrds version is called 'If You Don't Know Me By Now'.  All I know is that my version of the song is a variation of the Byrds version and the versions from The Allman Brothers are both variations of the Byrds version

Amazon review: The Beatles were a big band of British musicians.  This song is a part of a medley that also includes the songs 'Hey Jude', 'Hey Jumbo', 'The Long and Winding Road', 'All You Need is Love', 'Don't Bother Me', 'The Long and Winding Road', 'Hey Jude', 'I'm So Tired', 'I Feel Fine', 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', 'I Wanna Be Your Man', 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'I Want You (She's Only 19)', 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'If I Fell'.  It was recorded on February 4, 1962, with George Martin overdubbing two takes of 'Hey Jude'.  The Beatles were signed by the Apple Studios, Apple Corps, Apple Records and Parlophone Records.  George Harrison became a member of The Beatles and would later go on to form The Traveling Wilburys.   The song is named after the Beatles' song 'Hey Jude'.   The song is very good.  It's not my favorite song that the Beatles ever recorded.  I like some of the songs of the Beatles better, but the song 'Hey Jude' is my favorite.   I like this song with George Harrison.  He played the harmonica on this song.  I would never have thought the song was played by the Beatles without him on it.   There is a version of the song by The Beatles on the Abbey Road album.  It's a good song.  It's a good song in the Beatles catalog.   The song is good.  It's just not my favorite.   I like some of the Beatles better songs, but this song is not my favorite.   I like this song a lot better than the Beatles version.  I like the Beatles version better then this song.   This is the Beatles version of the song 'Hey Jude'.  It's a good song.  I like the Beatles version better than this song.   It's not my favorite Beatles song.   I like this song better

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Valerie : it has personality, class, great performing style. oh, it is beautiful.  I realy wish that it would be her signature song, not the " I'm not going to rehab, (no, no, no,) " one.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!
