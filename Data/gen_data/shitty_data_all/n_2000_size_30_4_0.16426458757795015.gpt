Amazon review: i liked this song until I watched the video.  Come on.  Then Robin Thicke got twerked on by Miley.  Ugh. While his wife played it cool for a while, eventually she left him. And finally he says he has addiction issues.  Am I the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movies where the singer/actor's personal life interfere's with my opinion of the actual song/movie?  (See:  Anything by Amy Winehouse; all things Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow or Rihanna)

Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First of all, I want to say that I'm a huge Robin Thicke fan.  He's good in movies, his wife is beautiful, and he has a great voice.  I just don't understand this song.  The song is catchy. The vocals are nice.  But this song is what I like to call "I'm bored with the whole thing already."  It's just a bunch of filler lyrics.  I've heard this song 5 times now.  I can't help myself.  I'm just sick of hearing the same song over and over.  The songs are good but this one is just boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a pretty good song.  The lyrics are nice.  The lead singer is a nice guy.  I like the song. It's nice to listen to.  But I'm not sure what the song is supposed to be.  The music is better than the lyrics.  The only thing that's bad about this song is the chorus.  I like the chorus.  But other than that, it's a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is really good.  The only down side is that the song is repetitive.  It doesn't have any real message.  It just gets repetitive and boring.  I'm not a fan of this song.  I'm not a fan of the lyrics either.

Amazon review: This is a good song, but it's hard to say if it's good or not.  The lyrics are nice and I think it's catchy, but the music is not.  This one is better than the other songs I've heard that start with the same lyrics.

Amazon review: This is some good music, right here! LaRue is a vocal beast. I had the pleasure of being at the live recording and I was blown away with her vocals, the background vocals and the band. Everything was on point. The music as easy to follow and I didn't feel cheated when it came to ministry. Although it was the recording for her CD, she still stayed with the ministry element and tears were flowing, hands were praised, and praises were being given to The Father.

Amazon review: A fine album, well written and well produced, and I am sure it will go a long way in evangelism. I think the name of the band is a reference to the book of Haggai by Zechariah.

Amazon review: Not what I was looking for- I wanted a reading of the sanskrit, the word for word definitions and the translation. The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.

Amazon review: I was looking for a new Beatles album.  I had been with this series for over a year, and I think I've grown tired of it.  I was given the good news that my first Beatles album was good.  I was pleasantly surprised.   This series did a good job of providing a variety of songs that had been made popular by Paul McCartney, so that the listener could choose what they liked.  I think this was a very good album.  Paul was in top form.  I really enjoyed the album and I will recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: A great new album by the band that has been my favorite since childhood.  The production is more than just a little bit dated but it's great.

I listened to it twice in a row and I was still blown away.   I also recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear the songs that made the band famous.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I got this for my boyfriend, and he loved it.  I love the fact that it's his favorite, but he's always liked the Beatles.  The album has the usual Beatles tunes mixed in with some new songs.  I like the Beatles, so I don't really know what's wrong with this album.  I guess I just want to hear all their tunes.  The lyrics are great.  I have to give it a 9.  This album is worth the money.

Amazon review: This is not a music review, but for those that are looking for a fun way to pass the time on a rainy day I suggest these songs.  The songs vary in quality from awful to good, but the one that stands out are "The End of the World" and "I am a Boy" which are very catchy and catchy.  "The End of the World" is the only song that I have had the pleasure of hearing live.   For those that like this kind of music, a 5 rating would be great.   I rate this at a 5.  I would recommend this album to anyone that likes good rock music.  If you like the Beatles, this album is for you!

Amazon review: If you're a Beatles fan, and you're looking for something to listen to while you watch the football game, this should be on at least one of your play lists.  It's not the best album in the series, but it's still pretty good.  The songs that make up this album are "I am a Boy", "Long, Long, Long Ago", "You'll Never Walk Alone", "I'll Say Yes", and "Let It Be".  I have not listened to this album in a while, so I don't know if there has been any changes to the songs or if the quality has changed.  This is the first album from the McCartney Beatles Series that I have not purchased.

Amazon review: I would give this 3 stars.  I bought this in hopes of hearing a little more of the Beatles in my life.  When I first heard this album I was disappointed.  The songs were okay, but the quality was poor.  I thought that I would have a better experience with this album.  I thought I would get a little more out of this album.  I was wrong.  After listening to it, I realized that I really don't like the Beatles.  I'm not a Beatles fan, I don't like the Beatles.  If you like the Beatles, you will like this album.  If you are not a Beatles fan, then this album is not for you.  The only reason that I would recommend this album is because it is the only Beatles album that I am aware of that I have never purchased.  I would give this album a 3 star rating.   I would recommend this album to anyone that likes the Beatles.  If you are looking for a Beatles album, you will like this album.

Amazon review: It was kind of a bummer that I had been hoping for better songs and an improved quality.   The album is okay and has some good songs.   This album is good for the Beatles fan but not for the Beatles.  I feel like I've heard this album enough that it's no longer a mystery to me as to why this album is not available.  It's just not a Beatles album.   It's not a Beatles album.  I have a feeling that this is just another McCartney Beatles album.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: Probably the worst excuse I've heard for a "musical". No actual music or story and the "lyrics" are just juvenile at best. Doesn't give me much hope for the future of Broadway if this is what people consider "music" or "art."

Amazon review: This band was my religion and my law for years.  That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this.  Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal.

Amazon review:  This is a really good song that is kind of slow and kind of boring.  It is pretty short and there is no real substance to it.

Amazon review:  This song is about an old man who is trying to live through the dying of the light but there is so much pain in the world that he can't stand it.

Amazon review:  I can't put my finger on it but the song just seems to be one of those songs that is a bit more complex then the rest of the album.  It just feels like it is more of a stand alone song than just part of the album.  I don't know, I just like it.

Amazon review:  I really like this album.  The song is called "The Night Is Gonna Fall" and it basically tells you the same thing, "the night is coming and it is gonna fall."  I like it because it is different from the rest of the album and it just sounds better.  I know the song is about war but I don't think that is what this song is about.  I think the song is about people who are trying to live through the war.  The album starts off with a song called "The Night Is Gonna Fall" which is basically the same thing.  That is the first song on the album and after that there are a couple of songs that are about war that are very powerful but I just don't think that is what this song is about.  I think this song is about people that are trying to live through the war.  I think the song is about people who are trying to live and what they are going through.  I don't know, I just like it.

I can see the lyrics of "In The Name Of Love" being so very well suited for a wedding, because it is a song about a man who loves his wife very much, but has to get away from her to escape the temptation to stray.

I enjoyed the way that the lyrics went along with the music, because it made it so that when he gets a chance to be alone with his wife, he takes it. He's so tempted to go out and see other women, but he's so loyal to his wife that he can't do anything to tempt her.

I really liked the way that the story was told, so that it made me think of how it would be to get away from temptation and to stay away from temptation.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: Lee Morgan, quit Mastbaum Tech in Philly and went on the road, and then rethought his decision and enrolled at Julliard for a year. When he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling. The brilliance of his tone is there, but his ideas have not yet been fully developed. Plus, Cliff Jordan's playing, the senior side man on this cut leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records.

Amazon review: The band's debut album is the only one on this album. It is a great album and easily one of the best albums of the 80s. With David Soul on lead vocals and guitar, the rhythm section consists of guitarist Mike Rojas and bassist Larry Young. The best of the three members is Young who really shines on this album. A good friend of the band described it as follows: "This album shows young Soul at his best. I mean, he shows us the true Soul that we all know is in him. The band is the one that brought us to the recording of this album as well as to the 'Love Is A Battlefield' tour that followed. The recording of this album and its live performances were a true gift to all that had the opportunity to be a part of it. Thank you to all the fans who have supported Soul and will continue to support him as he pursues his dream of becoming a star in the music industry."

Amazon review: A must-have album for any fan of classic rock and hard rock music. The opening track brings you into the world of classic rock with the classic line "You're a superstar in the making" and, "I can't hide from you" which are great. David Soul is truly a legend in the music industry. Soul's voice is truly on a par with the greatest rock singers of all time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an amazing album. I have been a fan of Soul since his days as the lead singer of the band 'I, The World, And Everything In It'. He's been my favorite singer since then, and this album is no different. This is a great way to get to know the man, and he's still a great singer.

Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.  I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

I love that there are songs about a woman who is on the verge of getting a divorce, and that she later learns that she is not the woman for him.

Amazon review: I have only listened to this album a couple of times in my life and must say that it's amazing! In fact, at first I thought that it was the same CD like on the cover, but the song "I Feel Love" is different. I like the song just as much as the one on the cover. I recommend everyone to buy it.

Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of Brian Wilson's work. After listening to this album for the first time, I realized that I have been underrating his music all along, when in fact it is probably the best he ever made. I also realized that I do not have to put up with all the negative reviews. I will always have this CD in my car. Also, I love the album cover, it is very classy and not as cheesy as most of the other album covers.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: As much as I can scream out Expletives about the GRRRRRREATNESS of QAF the show, the soundtrack falls sadly mediocre.  It touts itself as ALMOST LIKE being in BABYLON (a dancejoint that does not exist in real life), well I guess it does in a way, but it doesn't capture the whole feel of BABYLON. I was expecting remixes and stuff!  WHERE IS IT? On the whole I guess its an O.K. compilation.  A lot of you won't really get what I am saying but, that's okay too.

Amazon review: It's a pretty song, with great vocals, but I'm not sure about the lyrics/message. Once I downloaded and listened to it in it's entirety I was displeased- sounds rather morbid to me. Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas. Is it just me, or do the selections this year seem kind of lousy thus far? I really enjoyed this 25 days of free downloads advent-type "calendar" last year.

Amazon review: Country continues to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just can't hope to approach. Adkins' baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song, which is sung from the viewpoint of soldiers who lost their lives in various wars. This is a poignant and important recording, and is heartily recommended for listeners who still appreciate meaningful lyrics.

Amazon review: I should have just bought the one song that I liked. The 3 songs on the radio are the only ones that are worth a S*, the rest of the album sucks.

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Amazon review: Made in AUT in 1996, Serial# 33215-2, Playing Time 51:45 This is album #9 from Canada's self-proclaimed "Metal Queen", and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums. "Emotional Rain", her previous album, displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors, but this present album switches gears into what I call the "nowhere rock" genre. I like LA's singing, and "LA&2P" demonstrates her talents.

Amazon review: As a fan of TSO. we were looking forward to this new 2 CD set with great anticipation. When it arrived, we immediately slid it into the CD player and were very surprised and disappointed. Although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept releases by TSO, this concept left us very cool. There is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise. We are pretty sophisticated listeners with extremely diverse musical tastes, but I must say this one was a bust.

Also, purchase the one that is "in the style of Glee" so that the purchase goes to a good cause.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: What makes this so bad: The songs are all about the same (I don't like the songs that most people like), they all sound like the same song and they're all in a major key.  You can't skip songs, you can't skip the whole CD, you can't do anything.  Every step up in the song is the same boring, repetitive step up in the song, it has no interest or novelty.  The song "You" is so bad that it's actually funny.  I can't believe you didn't like it, it's by Patti LaBelle.  If you ever give me the name of a book you like I'll read it to you.

Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

This album is a collection of original tunes that I wish were a little more rock and roll.

Amazon review: After listening to this album for the first time, I did not like it. I did not like any of the songs on the album, but I did like the cover of the Beatles "A Day In The Life". I thought the song was catchy and I also liked the lyrics. However, this album is too short for me. I felt the entire album was about one minute and I did not know what was going to happen next. I thought it would take at least two albums before I would be able to listen to this album again.

Amazon review: If you are a fan of rock music, you will like this album. This is a collection of 12 rock songs and they have some very good lyrics.

I would not recommend this to anyone as it is not the best album I have ever listened to.

The only thing I don't like is the middle part of the song. The middle part is too slow. It's like the last part of a song that's just running out of steam. I wish they would have cut the song some, and let it last a little bit longer.

Amazon review: I don't know about other people, but I found this song to be very boring. It had a really sad beginning, but then the song went back to the boring part (I think the song was about a boy who died in a flood) with the same old lyrics. It's almost like the song was originally going to be about a woman who died, but they changed it. It sounded so much better as a sad song.

"Begging for a new record is like begging for the world to stop breathing and let us go," JB said. "It's not going to happen." JB and his band toured extensively throughout the late '90s and early 2000s, but never really made it to the big time. In 2010, he recorded a solo album on the label he founded, JB Records.
"I don't wanna talk about the past, I want to tell the story of what happened to me after I got dropped off the radar," he said. "I've been working, I've been making a record and I've been touring for seven years and I've never gotten a break."
The songs on JB Blues are the result of one simple concept: JB sets out to make an album that would be a great addition to any fan's collection. What would be a great addition to any fan's collection? He hopes that you'll agree with him.
"I don't want to be the guy that's got nothing left to say, I just wanna make the record that has everything and then it's just gonna be left and I'm gonna be like, 'This is what I want to say.'"
"I don't know what the record is gonna sound like, I don't know what the final product is going to sound like," he added. "All I know is that I'm going to be really honest, I'm not going to try and write a song that sounds like a song that a bunch of people are really gonna like."
"I don't want to be a hypocrite," JB said. "I just want to make the record that I think is the best song that I want to hear. Just to let everybody know. They deserve it."
J.B. Blues is available now on CD and digital download on JB Records.

Amazon review: This is actually a great song. I am truly a died hard fan for K. Michelle so I do not mind keeping it real. It is about time she is singing something that is a "make up record." She has always recorded break-up records and albums, and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new. She is crazy, sometimes rude and take things to the extreme, but one thing that is true is that she can sing! Support real music and trust she will deliver.

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE AC/DC fan and they are my favorite band. I don't normally buy their albums but this was such a great album for me. It contains the 4th of July concert from the 60's. I love songs about life and living in the country. The song "Dirty" is one of my favorites and I would have bought this album just for that song. The best songs are the ones where they sing the lyrics and not about the show and the crowd. I think the crowd noise is what makes these songs so special.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band, but have been disappointed in the past. I will admit that I don't listen to the newer stuff as much as I used to. I have enjoyed this album though. The band is doing a lot of different things musically. I like the more mature sound of songs like "Love Story" and "Jailhouse Rock." The band plays the song "You Shook Me All Night Long" with an old school feel, and I really like their new sound with the added harmonies. It is a nice change of pace. I like the clean guitars, and I have always liked the heavy guitars. I think it is good to have a variety of styles to choose from.
