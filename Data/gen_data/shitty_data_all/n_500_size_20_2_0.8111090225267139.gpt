Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the Beatles.  The fact that they were a trio and not a duo was very important to me.  And they were one of the last great rock bands, and a great example of the way a band should work.  I'm not a big fan of their later solo work, but most of their songs (the ones I'm not a fan of) are great and timeless classics.  The Beatles in their prime were one of the greatest rock bands of all time.

Amazon review: It is one of the most innovative bands ever.  The sound of their music is fantastic and at times almost like a new genre.  They have their "songs" that are great - "Ticket to Ride", "Penny Lane", "I'm a Boy", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band",  "Eleanor Rigby",  "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Their "best" songs are just phenomenal - "Penny Lane", "If I Needed Someone".  They have a great album called "The White Album" that is a masterpiece of pop music, and it's one of the best in the world.  If you have not heard it yet, get it!

Amazon review: The first part of this record has a slow, mellow feel, and after a minute or so, I thought, "these guys must not be used to performing live."  But to my surprise, they kept playing, and I got a lot deeper into the music.  It was so good, I knew I couldn't let it go.  I bought it again and again, and now I've downloaded all the songs.  So much so, that I've downloaded a few songs and the entire album.  I would not have it any other way.

Amazon review: This band is extremely talented.  I love the band.  I'm a huge fan, and they have an amazing catalog.  They have a great "album" called "Pale Blue Eyes" that is one of my favorites.  They've been around for over 50 years, and they've been a staple in the music scene ever since.  And even though they are older, they are still very good, and have a very talented and creative group of musicians.

Amazon review: For those of you who haven't heard this band yet, the name is a reference to the "Hanging Curve" in the song "Pale Blue Eyes".  I love this band.  They are very talented and have a great range.  And they have a unique sound that's very different from most bands.  And I love that.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of 'Sweet & Low' since its debut on the A-List in 2006.  While I have a feeling there are better bands out there, and I am very happy with my purchase, I feel like I was misled by this band.  I did not know they were this great and they did not tell me, which is really disapointing.  I would go back to buy this CD.  However, if you have a CD that is in the same genre, you should listen to the samples.  In my opinion, this is a very poor CD.

Amazon review: I like Josh Groban, but I'm not a fan of this.  I didn't like the way they were playing.  It was like they had their hands on the fiddle and were just playing.  The music was all over the place, and the vocals were monotone most of the time.  The lyrics were terrible, and I think the lyrics were written by the drummer.  The production was also poor, and the mixing was awful.  This CD would be nothing without the samples.  I think if it was the entire CD that would have been better.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone, unless you are a fan of Josh Groban.  (Also, I think this CD was overpriced.  It was way too much money to pay for a CD).

This is a very good CD that is worth buying.  However, I do feel like the vocals were a tad weak.  The band sounded much better on the videos they put up on YouTube, and I think the music was better on the CD.  In the video's I think the band sounded much better.  I would say this was a very good CD, but I think it probably needs more than the samples for it to be great, and more than a CD.  I think the vocals could have been better, and I think the band sounded better with more instruments.  I think the production was good, but could have been better.  I really liked this CD.  I would recommend it to anyone who has a Josh Groban CD they want to buy.

I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban since I was very young and this album made me hate him.  I was so excited to buy this CD so I could see how great it was.  However, I found out how much trash this CD was before I even got it home!  I would have given it a half star if I could.  It is awful.  I have had so many great albums in the past.  I loved 'Sweet & Low', 'I'm Still Here', and 'The Artist'.  I was so excited when my friend bought this CD for me.  I love Groban.  I was excited, because I was excited to get a CD by Groban.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: This song is a classic, and I think I love Amy Macdonald's voice more than I do the rest of her musical talents.  It's got a great beat, a simple melody, and of course it's got a great chorus.

It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.

Amazon review: I bought this for my mom for Christmas.  I think she will love this album.  I think she will enjoy it.  I think the lyrics are good, but not for me.  They are just not for me.  I don't know if it's because I'm too old, or what.  I just don't know.  I think it would be good for her, but she isn't a big fan of country music.  My cousin says that country is just for old people.  She doesn't understand why people don't like country music.  I'm not that old.  I just don't know.  So, I don't know if this album will be good for her.  But I think that it will be good for her.  I do think that this album will be good for her.

Amazon review: I bought the CD for my sister's birthday, and she said the CD was a hit.  I thought that she would love it.  She has loved country music for a long time, and I wasn't sure about whether she would like this.  I think she will love it.  She has many of these songs on her iPod, and she listens to country music.  When she listens to it, she thinks it's good.  She says that she likes that it's not slow and slow, but just picks up the pace.  She said that she likes the lyrics good, that it doesn't rhyme all the time.  I think that she will love it, it has many good songs.

This file has been in my collection for about 5 years. It should be much more popular, but I can't get a good copy anywhere.

This is a great way to get a little classical music into your life. The only problem is that you can't listen to it while doing something else, like surfing the web or playing a game.

When I first started using this, I didn't know what to think of it. It was so exciting to hear a classical piece for the first time and have it be an instrument in the background and not the background of a video. I found it a little frustrating at first, but I quickly got better at it. When I heard the wonderful piece, I would change the song and the piece would change to match. I would listen to it, and just let it wash over me. I love it.

I used a lot of different songs in my first few weeks of using this app. I liked the ability to pause the song and just listen to it. This is a good app for people who like classical music.

This app helps you enjoy classical music while you are doing something else, like driving, surfing the web, or watching a movie. This app is very good and I recommend it.

I just bought this app but I wish there was a version for the Android Market. There are several free apps that are good for classical music listening, but they are not as good as this one.

This is a great way to get a little classical music in your life. The only problem is that you can't listen to it during something else, like surfing the web or playing a game.

I used this app for the first time this week. I was not sure how to use it, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked. It is a great app for classical music.

I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I lost my cd of "A Million Dollar Baby" (I think). I took it to my local library to see if they had it. They did not, so I went to the internet and looked it up.

The quality of the sound sounds better than the other two so far.  I am not sure it is worth the money, but I guess I will just have to wait and see.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

I will say that the first song, "I'm Tired", is a great song but the second song, "You Know I'm No Good", is just not the same as the first song. I didn't like it. Don't listen to the first song either. It's another typical Timberlake song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think Timberlake is going down the wrong path with this album. This album is not good but the first three songs are good. One thing I love about Timberlake is that he writes songs that he loves, songs that are deep and meaningful. I think this album does not measure up to his previous albums. I would like to give this album a 4 star rating but for me, the only song that holds a 4.0 is "You'll See". I just wish he wrote more of his own material.

Amazon review: This is the second Timberlake album I've listened to and it's really good but I couldn't see myself buying it.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree, it's not the best.  Toni Braxton's voice is not the greatest.  There are some good songs on this CD but a lot of others are forgettable.  There are no "cool" songs on this album.  Some of the tracks are ok, a few are really good, but I would give this CD a "B" rating.
Sentiment: Neg

Amazon review: The songs on this CD are all good, but I can't figure out why they were put together.  I can't figure out why Toni Braxton is on this CD.

Amazon review: Another CD that I have never heard before, this one has a lot of songs that I have never heard before, but I have listened to them and they are good, I thought it would be a nice change from the usual CD's I bought.  At first I thought the CD was going to be a dud, but after I got through about half of the CD, I realized that it is a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  I would recommend this CD to anybody who wants an eclectic type of CD, but if you haven't heard it before, don't waste your money on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a good listen, though I would not recommend listening to it on the day of the CD release, as there are many songs that were written and produced in the early 90's that have been completely remixed.  The CD is worth listening to, but I would not recommend anyone buy this CD on the day of the release, as there are a lot of songs that have been remixed.  The CD has a good sound, but the songs are not that great.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants a CD that is a little different.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD has some good tracks on it, but I think that the tracks I have heard that are new are too random and just doesn't get me to care about the songs, and maybe I am a little bias and I don't think Toni Braxton is that great in the beginning, but most of the songs are good.  I would recommend this CD to anybody who likes electronic music.

Amazon review: This CD sounds really good.  I liked the song "I'll Be There For You".  I like the song "Heart" and "I Don't Wanna Go" have catchy tunes.  The song "I Do" is good.  "Habit" is a bit repetitive, but it's not bad, and I like it.  The song "Can't Stop" has a good beat.  It's a good CD.

Amazon review: The lyrics are very interesting and the music is very good.  I just wish they didn't have to change the name to "the Queen".  They have been doing this for so long and it's time for them to go on their way.  It's better off with them being known only by their name.  This is a great album!  I would suggest this to anyone!

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I can't imagine anyone but the Newsboys performing this song, especially on stage. We were all pumped to see them when we saw them at the last reunion show. But, to me, this song could be their signature song. It's got a great mix of pop and rock that works well together. The song is one of my favorites on the entire album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I actually listened to Newsboys when I was younger and loved the music. So, when I heard the news that the Newsboys weren't coming back, I was bummed. But, this is really good. They don't sound like they're doing the same old songs on this cd. They're doing some of their best music ever.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A really good album.  I can't imagine what this will sound like with a full band and a full orchestra and all that. But, I think so far, this is the best they've been. I'm a huge fan of the Newsboys and so are a lot of people. I'm so happy that the Newsboys are still performing.

Amazon review: I've bought the original album (Newsboys 1994) and I've bought this cd as a "second time around" and I'm very happy with it. The band is very tight and I really like the songs. I would say that it's pretty much the same as the original and that is why I bought it.
