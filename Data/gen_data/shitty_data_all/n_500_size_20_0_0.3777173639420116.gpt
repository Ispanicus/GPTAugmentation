Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm happy to hear he's writing songs again, not just singing them.  I hope this one will be a good addition to the disc.  He's got a unique sound that's a bit more "upbeat" when he sings "I will see you again," and he does it well.  The song is a bit more "rockish" than his previous material, and he really shows it with his voice.  It's a lot slower than his other songs, but it's a good song.  We all know he's a great singer, but he seems to have become a bit more polished, especially in his voice, which is a good thing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this song a lot better than I thought I would!  I love that there is something different about it.  I'm just glad that I know the story behind it, because I love it.  It's a great song, and I like the new arrangement.  I'm glad he's writing again, and I hope the song can be a hit.  This will be a great addition to his disc!  I'm sure he will be a hit with us, and he's sure got great music!  I believe I will love this song!

Amazon review: I love the song "All of Us" - it's a great song with a great message!  It's the perfect song to get out and about in the summertime.  I don't know why people think it's a rip-off of another song, but I love it!

Amazon review: I love this song.  I wish I could get more of his albums, but since I have been listening to him for years, I have to wait for a few years, and if that happens, I will still be listening to him.  I love songs written by people who have not let fame, money or success get in the way of their music.  I have been listening to him for at least 10 years now, and I can't imagine putting this song down.  Josh is a great singer and songwriter, and I hope this one will be a great addition to his disc.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to this song a few times now. I really enjoy it, but I am afraid it is a bit too slow for me.  I would prefer a faster song.  When Josh finally releases his new album, I will let you know.  I am not yet his biggest fan, but I do like songs that are great and have originality.

Amazon review: I really like Josh's voice.  I have noticed how much his voice has improved and still sounds great.  I like the song "I Really Couldn't Care Less" because it is one of his best.  I love the song "You Were Right" because it is perfect with the music.  I hope to hear more of his songs.

Amazon review: I just finished listening to this and I like it, but I would like it to be a bit longer.  I still like it a lot, but I would like it to be longer.  And I don't think I want it to be too long.  I like songs with long introductions and bridges.  I hope to hear more of his songs.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.

Amazon review: This is the first album I've heard of the Ray Sinatra Orchestra.  I had heard the song "Why Shouldn't I" before coming to this album, but I'd never heard this one.  It's a good song with a great message.  I would definitely recommend this album to someone who enjoys Ray Sinatra.  I would recommend this album to someone who likes Ray Sinatra songs.  I would recommend this album to someone who likes Ray Sinatra's albums.  I would recommend this album to someone who likes Ray Sinatra and Mary Martin.  I would recommend this album to someone who likes Ray Sinatra, Mary Martin, and the song "Why Shouldn't I."  It's good, but I wouldn't say it's a great album.

amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  I like a lot of the songs on it.  The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the song "It's Alright (for Lazarus)" is missing.  This is the first Ray Sinatra album where I can't even remember the second song.  I enjoy the album and I think it's a good album.  I don't think it's a great album though.  I don't think it's a great album, but it's a pretty good album

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.

Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: This song, which is called "I Am Alive", was composed by Randy Newman, and was performed by Celine Dion and Michael Bolton in the film "Something Wild".  I think the song has a message about what it means to be alive.  I found the song to be very sad, and felt that it was a really good song.  It is from the album "Something Wild," which was released in 2002.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

Amazon review: As a follow up to my review of "The Voice of the Revolution," I just wanted to add some things that I've heard about the show.
1) The show is being presented as some kind of reality TV show.
2) The contestants have not been told what the "challenge" is.
3) There are two people left.
4) The show is being presented as a "contest," without any sort of real contest.
5) There are some of the contestants who are good singers (but have no personality) and some who are not.
6) The producers are not really taking any risk on any of the contestants (though there are some that are not).
7) There are not enough "challenges" to be involved with the show.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: There is a problem with this CD. I really like the last track, and think it is a great song, but the rest of the CD is a bit of a disappointment.  The first half is OK, but the second half is bland and uninteresting.  The songs are good, but the album is too short.  I would recommend this CD, but only if you like slow and soft songs.  There are a few good songs, but the rest are weak and uninteresting.  I give 1 star.

Amazon review: This CD is a disappointment.  This CD does not have any good songs.  There is one good song, but that is about it.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I remember when I was a kid, and I was always in my room, and I loved that feeling of freedom. I remember walking down the street, and I was always looking up into the sky, and I loved the way the sun was shining down on me, and the way it felt so peaceful. When a band could make me feel all of these things, that is the band I have been in love with.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: You're going to love it, and you'll love the songs. It's just kind of a sad song, and I feel I'm missing out on something.

Amazon review: I've bought all the movies in the series, and I have found the audio adventures to be a little lacking in quality. I am not sure if it is the sound quality or the fact that they sound like they are recording on a soundboard. I have bought all of the soundtrack albums and have listened to them from start to finish several times. I have not been able to find the CD's anywhere, even though there is a lot of money in them. I am sorry to say that I think they are not worth the price of the music that I paid for them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was disappointed by the DVD's and the audio adventure as well. I like the concept of the series and I really enjoyed the first movie (the one with the giant cock, I mean giant) and the second movie (the one with the huge cock, I mean giant) but the audio adventure was just not up to par. The sounds were out of sync and the audio quality was horrible. My CD was purchased in late December and I have been waiting for a new release of the audio adventure, but so far I have been hearing nothing. For the price of the music (which is what kept me purchasing the DVDs) these two movies should have had a much better audio adventure than what was made available.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this music. I love the art, I love the lyrics, and I love the way it sounds. And that is what makes it great. I love this music and I will continue to buy it. It is just so hard to find. I bought this CD because I found it on a blog and I love it so much.

Amazon review: The film is very funny. It is the story of a wife who falls in love with a married man. She marries him. They have a child. She is happy. He is happy. They live happily ever after. The problem is that they are not married anymore and the marriage was fake. I think I saw that one on the Travel Channel, it was good.
