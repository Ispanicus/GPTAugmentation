Amazon review: I have bought this CD several times and continue to buy it.  I like the music of Casting Crowns and have bought their albums over the years. However, I was disappointed in this CD by the lack of new material and songs. I have tried to contact them multiple times but have never received a response. It is disappointing that their new CD has been so poorly received.

Amazon review: I love this band and I have been a fan of their music since the early 1990s when I started buying their albums. They are one of the most underrated group of the 90s. I bought this CD when they released their third album, Heartbreaker. I found the CD to be very well done and worth the price of the CD. I also have the second CD of this CD and I have been buying it for a year now. I am very satisfied with this CD and hope they continue to make more CD's.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I found on the 4th day, only when I went to purchase, I was told that I would have to buy the CD to get the download. I was so excited that I could now go to the store and purchase it that I was so disappointed when I went to purchase. I could not buy the CD. I could not download it.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Dallas Holm since 1986, when I first heard her on the "Music Radio" show. My first CD was a CD put out by Dallas Holm, and I was very taken by Dallas Holm's singing, and I began to buy her CDs until I could no longer tolerate her music. I stopped buying her CDs, until I was faced with another "Music Radio" show, and I saw her on the show. This time, instead of talking about her music, she talked about "Dallas", a singer, and she played a CD of Dallas' music. She played a CD of Dallas' music. This time, in the middle of one of the songs, I had a thought. "I wonder if Dallas sings".
I didn't know if Dallas sang, but I decided to go to the store to see. What a nightmare. The clerk said, "You can't buy that CD". The clerk said, "You have to buy that CD, to get the download option". I was very disappointed. I decided to buy the CD anyway, to get the download option. I did buy the CD anyway.
I decided to download the CD, to get the download option. The download option was terrible. It was a horrible download. It was so horrible that I had to delete that download

Amazon review: I listened to the album twice before deciding to make this review.  I had high hopes for this album.  I was really excited to hear the new sounds and the new songs.  However, I am starting to feel like I am listening to some of the same old Trainor songs on repeat.  The new songs sound really good but I feel like they are repeating songs that have already been done.  I don't know if this album was her first attempt at releasing an album with different sounds or not.  I would say yes but I am not sure.  The album seems like she may have made a few different attempts at the same music.  There are some great songs on the album, but I just do not like the album as a whole.  The album just does not move me the same way other Trainor albums do.  I would give this album a two.

Amazon review: I listened to a few of their CDs but have no idea how they got the song on there.  The song "The One I Love" is a song by a musician who is not to be confused with the other singer.  I was surprised that their music included two instruments as a bass and drums.  There is absolutely no bass in the song, and the drums are a drum kit.  I don't see any bass at all in the song, and there is no bass in the video, except for one bass drum.  I don't see any drums in the song either.  I couldn't find any information about the song on Amazon, except for the lyrics, which I have seen in the lyrics section.  The song in question is by a very popular musician.  I have no problem paying for all of their music to make sure it's all they have.  I can't imagine them making some other song available at the same price.  I don't mind paying for a song, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: It was a bit hard to get into.  But, there is a bit of a story, that the author does share with you.  It is a story about a woman who was born blind.  And, it was the woman's wish to have her sight restored as soon as possible, so she went to a blind society clinic.  It was supposed to take three years.  She had to pay a $1000 fee to get her sight restored.  But, the woman got her sight back within the three years.  She is now a proud blind woman.  The author tells you about her story, and you decide whether you want to read the book, or not.  The author tells you a little bit about the society clinic, but most of the story is told from the woman's point of view.  She tells the story in a very interesting way.  I really liked the book.  If you would like to read it, Amazon has it for you.  You can find the book on the Amazon site by searching "A Blind Woman's Story: A True Story."  I have no idea why the author has chosen to tell a story that is the story of a woman who was born blind.  But, I assume the story is interesting, and the author has a good story to tell.  I have no problem with this book.  I would recommend it to any person who is interested in reading a true story that is interesting.  It's very good.

Amazon review: The narrator is a young woman, who can't sing very well, or play piano very well, but she can communicate very well with you.  She is an intelligent person.  She is very clear and very articulate.  She clearly shows you how important communication is to you.  She tells you how you can be friends with someone without having to talk to them.  The narrator also tells you that you can be friends with people who are too shy to speak to you.  She has a very good voice for the narrator, and it's not very high.  It's not a very deep voice.  The book is very good.  It's a good story of friendship and how you can be friends with people who aren't very friendly.  It's a very good book.  I can't imagine people not wanting to read a book about a young woman who can't sing or play piano very well, but can communicate very well with you, and who is intelligent.

Amazon review: I have been on a buying binge for a great deal of music lately. I have a CD player in my car so I listen to my car radio while driving. I started with this album.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I could not get the original on iTunes or Amazon. I wanted to purchase the original. Unfortunately, the original album is not available on iTunes or Amazon. They told me that they don't have the original recording because the master is not available. I asked them to transfer it from a CD. They told me that they could not transfer the master because it was not available, and I would have to purchase the album. I just wanted to purchase the album. I purchased the album and it is great. I have had no problem with the transfer. I have had no problem with the sound quality either.

While I was listening to it, it was still going in the CD player, so I finished listening to it, and then I put the CD in my CD player and tried to listen to it. It was still going on the CD player. So I put it in the player again, and then it was suddenly on the CD player, so I put it in the player again, and then it was on the CD player, so I put it in the player again, but it was gone.

A:

This is a very good album that should appeal to any listener. It's well worth the price. All the tracks are excellent. There are no filler tracks in this collection. All of the tracks are great. But I just want to say this CD is not perfect. There are a few tracks that are very repetitive, some tracks are a little too short and many of them are a little too long. But the music is outstanding. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to some classical music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Schubert is more popular these days, but this is a fine album. The only problem is the recording of his Piano Sonata in E-flat Major.  It is a very good recording, but it is not the best of the Beethoven piano sonatas.  In fact, this is the most important of the Beethoven piano sonatas and should be played at a high level.  I don't know where they got the recording, and it is too quiet.  It makes it an impossible album to listen to at a low level.  The recording is very good and the performance is excellent.  I would recommend this album to anyone who has not done this before.

A:

I'm not sure at all.

In your link you have an example of a good recording of a Beethoven piano concerto.

In that example the piano part is recorded in the concerto, but it's not on all tracks.

The second example is Beethoven piano sonata op 99 in D minor, but it's also not all tracks.

The second link you provided is the recording of the Brahms Concerto No. 2.

In the example you provided, the piano part is not on all tracks, but the orchestra is.

So in your case, I think it's a matter of choosing the right tracks, and then editing them to fit the songs.

This is from the first link:

Mozart: Symphony No. 39, K. 525

Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 5 in C major, Op. 101

Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 5 in F minor, Op. 99

Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 1, Op. 30

Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 2 in E-flat major, Op. 102

Beethoven: Piano Sonata No. 3 in B-flat major, Op. 103

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have this cd and it is one of my favorites. I listen to it at least once a week.  I bought this after my favorite singer, the one that I thought would be in my cd, got married and left the company.  I purchased all the CDs in the series on the hope that it will get me to the top of the charts.  I can tell you what I have accomplished:  I have got on the air radio station, I have got on the radio station for the local cable television station, I have got on the local newspaper in a small town, I have got on the local radio station, I have got on the local college radio station, and I have got on the local cable TV station.  I have received two awards at local radio and I have become a member of the local radio group.  I have received an award from my local college.  I have received a lot of letters from people that say, "I think your cd is great, thank you."  I have gotten a lot of good letters from people that I have never met and it makes me feel good to know that people are enjoying it.  I have been on the radio station for 18 months now and the station is still growing.  I have received a lot of letters from people that say, like me, "I would like to hear more of your music."  I have received a lot of letters from people that say, "Thank you for your music."  I have received a lot of letters from people that want to come to my show.  I have received a lot of letters from people that say, that, like me, they enjoy my music.  I have gotten a lot of letters from people that say, like me, "I want to learn more about your music, please send me more of it." (I have always sent them my CD's.)  I have also received a lot of letters from people that say, like me, "Your music made me feel a lot better."  I have received a lot of letters from people that say, like my wife, that she thinks my music is the best of all the music she has ever heard.  I have received a lot of letters from people that say,  like my wife, that she thinks she has never met anyone that has a better musical taste than me.  I have had a lot of letters from people that said, "I am very glad to have met you."  I have received a lot of letters from people that say,  "I thought you were the greatest of all the singers I have ever heard."  I have received a lot of letters from people that say, they like my music and tell me that I am the best singer they have ever heard.  I have received a lot of letters to the effect of, "you should keep singing."  I have received a lot of letters to the effect of, "I hope my family will like your music."  I have received a lot of letters to the effect that, like my wife, they say, the music she heard on my cd, is the greatest music that she has ever heard.  I am not trying to sell any cd's that I have made but I am telling you that some people like my music and some people don't like it, but my music is not to blame for the music that people like or don't like.  Thank you,

Amazon review: This is a great cd from a great band.  I have been a fan of their recordings since their first CD and this CD is no different.  I have always liked a little bit of hip-hop, but my favorite  hip-hop artist is Snoop Dogg.  I was really impressed by their first album.  I have been a fan of their recordings since their first CD.  I have been a fan of their recordings since their first CD, and I have been a fan of them since 1998.  I have been a fan of them since 1998.  I have been in love with them since 1999.  Their music is so much better than any of the other "pop-rock" bands.  Their music is so much better than any of the other "dance-rock" bands.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

I just hope that they can release another album soon.

Amazon review: this is an ok cd, but not good, the songs are kinda catchy but i couldnt think of any song which is original, but i could not think of any song which is so unique. The band also does not seem to have any real songs to sing at the moment.

Amazon review: This is a really solid album - I was thoroughly impressed with it.  This is my favorite of the new releases by Mumford!  I had initially been put off by the fact that it contained only a handful of songs from their previous albums, but after hearing this I was satisfied that I had not been fooled by the cover.  This is a classic, well-crafted, high-energy, well-sung set of songs.  I'm very much looking forward to their next album.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I love this CD.  Thalia is beautiful, very talented and her voice is amazing.  However, she has a bad habit that causes her to lose her voice when singing over the top of her lyrics and this CD is full of bad habits.  She sings over her own lyrics, her voice is out of tune.  She sings over the top of other songs, and the only time she doesn't sing over another song is when she sings over her own words, which is annoying.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She decides to move to a cabin in the woods and begins working on her music. It's the first time she has written any kind of music. She plays her guitar and sings in that cabin. She starts to write songs about her lost love and soon becomes a famous musician. It's a powerful and beautiful song.

Amazon review: The song is very good, but I think it is a little much for a first show. I think that a few songs should be played during the show. I think it should include a couple of songs from the new album, and it should include a song from the old album, "What You Do for Love" if possible.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
