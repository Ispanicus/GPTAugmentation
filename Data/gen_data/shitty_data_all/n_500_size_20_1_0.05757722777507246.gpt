Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really hope that this is not Flame's last album, its been too long! I have not seen this person in years. This is not even close to the quality of older albums. Give credit to the fact that one of the songs, (It's You), has been on radio forever, and I've heard a lot of radio stations play this song.

Amazon review: This is a studio album, and its not bad. Still very disappointing, but I really hate it when I hear a studio album, and it's not even a studio album.

But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

I'm going to try this one for size. I have a feeling it's going to be a great album. I do have one question though, why is it listed as "Good" condition? The condition is only "excellent" and it's not even in good shape at all. I would say it's in the bottom 5% of albums by its condition. I'll try and find a copy later to really get a feel for it, but for now I'll say it's pretty much in the bottom 5%.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

I agree with the other reviewer that some of the songs need to be performed live.  There is a lot of good music here, and I wish we could have heard even more.  This is the best cd of the year so far.  I especially enjoy the live performances of the songs from the "New Songbook".  I'm sure it will be even better than the original recording.  Great CD!

Amazon review: Great cd!  It has a lot of great songs, as well as a great live performance of one of the newer songs "Saints".

I will definitely buy a second copy.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

I have been looking for a selction of music that truly encapsulates the human spirit. This album is exactly what I have been looking for.

I do not know who the band is, but when I saw the band I was hooked. I love the way they sound and the band's ability to make music that really connects with humans.

Amazon review: Nancy Sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault!  She should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would give this a 2.5 based on the fact that it sounds like a used car that hasn't been taken care of.  I would give it a 1 based on the fact that it sounds like a car that has been maintained for a week but I would have to say it was "frizzed"  by the sound of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why I liked this one.  I think this was a ripoff of a song used in a movie that was a big hit.  The vocals are good for movie sound tracks but this is a song that you could do without.  No one sounds like this on any of the albums that I have heard.

Amazon review: I listen to a lot of "new age" music and there's nothing on this list that compares to it.  I do like the music on this list, but it's not a "new age" music type.  It has a lot of great parts but it's not a song that will make you feel good.  It's just a list of songs that you can play while you're driving, riding a bike, or whatever.  It's just a fun song to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I listen to classical music and this is a really cool piece of music to listen to, but I wouldn't listen to it in a car.  I know what you mean by the car stereo.  I have to have my music on while I'm driving because my car is loud.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I listen to a lot of classical music and I have to say that this is one of the best.  I've never heard a piece of classical music that is this good of a song.  It's so good that it keeps us listening.  The only problem is that it's only 4 songs so you have to have a lot of time to listen to it.  This is a really cool piece of classical music.  I don't think I would listen to it in a car.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: If you like to hear a new song by a new artist each week and are a fan of the band, then this compilation is for you. This is how you choose your favorite song each week.

Amazon review: This is my first review. I am glad I chose this track!  I have to say, I like the song, but I just don't think it's as good as Chronic and 2001.  I think the sound is a little different, but I like it.  I like the lyrics to the song, too.  I just don't think it's as good as the other two. It's good, but not as good as the other two.

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

Amazon review:  I have to say, the only song on this album I really like is "I've Never Done Anything Like This". I don't know any other song that can top that song.  I will say that I did like "I Don't Need To" a little. It's a song I would have liked to have seen more of.  But it's not bad, and it has a good beat to it.  It's definitely worth hearing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The second BFS song, "I Don't Need To" is a good song, but not as great as the first.  I still love "I Don't Need To" though.  The third song on the album is "Not So Different" which is pretty good, I like it.  The last song is "I've Never Done Anything Like This" which I think is my favorite song on the album. I like the beat, the hook and the vocals, but the lyrics are just the worst.  I'm really glad this song was in the album.  I hate that they took the best song from this album and just used a different song.  I really hate when that happens.  I think it hurts the album because I like the songs from this album, and they have some of my favorite songs on it.  But they took the best song that they had and put a completely different song on the same album as the original song.  That's just not right.  I don't mind that there's one song on the album I like better than the rest.  It's just a shame that they took the best song from the album and made a completely different song out of it.  That's not good.  But it's still a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   I love the new song, so I will wait to listen to it.  But there are a couple of other songs I've heard before that I don't like.  The first one is "I Don't Need To".  It's a pretty good song, but I didn't like it as much as "I Don't Need To" at first.  Then I heard "Not So Different", and then I heard "I've Never Done Anything Like This" and I liked the last one better.  I heard all three songs, and I don't know which one I liked best.  It's kind of hard to tell.  I really liked the last song, "I've Never Done Anything Like This", but not as much as "Not So Different".  I really like the last song, but not as much as "I Don't Need To", "Not So Different" or "I've Never Done Anything Like This".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I don't really like Amy Macdonald's music, but this single is awesome.  The song itself is good and I think it's a good song.  It's just her voice.  I don't know why people have been singing it for years.  It's not that important.  The second song is a mix of "I Don't Need To" and "Not So Different".  I can't tell them apart, but they're both a little different.  The third song is a mix of "I Don't Need To" and "I've Never Done Anything Like This".  Again, I can't tell what song it is, but I like them all.  I like "I Don't Need To", "Not So Different" and "I've Never Done Anything Like This".

Amazon review: This is the first single of Amy Macdonald's new album. I really enjoy the first song, "I Don't Need To". It's a bit different than her usual sound, but I like the song. I'm excited to hear more of her music.  I like the second song, "Not So Different". It's good, but I think it's better as a single than as a whole album.  The third song is a little different from the first two.  I really love this song.  It's good, but not as good as the first two songs.  The four songs are all different, and it's a good album, but I don't know if I would go for the whole album.  I think I like Amy Macdonald's music better as a whole album.  I like all the songs, but I love the songs on I Don't Need To the best.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

Amazon review: This album is one of the best albums I've downloaded this year. I feel like I've listened to it three times already, and I'm sure I will listen to it four or five more times before the last track ends. I love the melodies and the arrangements, and the overall quality is excellent. The only thing I found a little lacking was the lyrics, but that could be because I'm a little old, and I tend to have a hard time understanding lyrics. Overall, this album is awesome, and I highly recommend it.

Amazon review : I had two of these, once I got them I thought it was just some sort of prank, but when I saw the size of the discs it turns out to be true. I like the album a lot, I really enjoy it, I can listen to it over and over, and I'm sure I will as this is a very good album. The only thing is that the album sounds a little bit different from the album I listened to before. The melodies are a bit different also, but it is still a very good album. I would recommend to everyone.
