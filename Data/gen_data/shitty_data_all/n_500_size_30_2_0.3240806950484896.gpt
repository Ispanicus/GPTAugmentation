Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I love the album, and I am very impressed with the performance. I have never listened to her before, but I have been listening to her in other genres, (country, jazz, folk, pop) and this album has really helped me to hear her sing with a great range of emotion. I recommend this album to all people who appreciate a great female singer.

Amazon review: I haven't been this impressed with a new artist in a long, long time.  Carina Round is, without a doubt, the best female singer in the world today.  Her voice is mesmerizing, and it's a pleasure to listen to.  I have heard her sing several times in other genres, and I have been in awe of her ability to sing in different styles.  She has amazing ability to change her singing voice so that it sounds like a different person.  She has a voice that is smooth and warm, yet strong and clear.  Her singing style and delivery is very personal.  Her songs are so well written, and she has such an amazing voice, I am not sure if I have heard one that sounds as good.

Amazon review: I have loved Carina Round since she was a young girl.  I have seen her perform live several times, and I have loved every song from her repertoire.

I am an avid fan of Carina Round and her wonderful music, and I can't wait to hear this album in the theatre.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I love the drums on this album.  It's a great mix of drumming, with lots of different styles.  I love the way they incorporate the piano into the mix, and they do this by having the piano play a chord before playing the drums on the same chord.  They also have the drums and the piano playing the same note in their different orders. There are lots of little things that make this album so unique.

About two years ago, I started to learn to play piano again.  I'm in love with the piano and I'm getting back into playing it.  I bought the CD 'Piano For Dummies' and I started learning the songs for my first songbook.  It was great to get back into playing piano.  I haven't made it all the way to the end of the songbook, but I've made it to most of the songs on the CD so far.  I'm going to work on the last song soon and then I'm going to practice it for a few weeks.  I may even try to learn the song, but I'm not planning on playing it until I've completed the songbook.

I have listened to this 3 times and I am amazed at how good it really is.  I love the song "Gentle".  It is a true soul and it is one of my favorite songs.  I hope you will enjoy this album also.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Tony Bennett singing and I have listened to this 5 times.  It is a very good album.  The only thing I would say about the album is that there is a small portion of the song that is stuck on repeat.  I can't stand to hear the same song over and over again.  I have listened to it 4 times and I am amazed at how good the song is.  I hope you will enjoy this album.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the fact that this album is not called "The Chronic" because I don't think that's what we're getting. I thought this album was "cute", but I am not sure. The album is pretty much the same as the Chronic in that it's all over the place with different people singing the same style of rap. Also, the vocals are very odd with some rappers singing and others acting like they're talking to themselves. I don't think this album stands out from the rest of the Chronic because it's not all over the place like that. Of course, it does have some good tracks, but it is not a classic.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Yes, it is. I have been waiting for this album for over a year and now it has finally been released. I love both of these artists, and this is a great album. The vocals by both artists are really good. My only concern is the same as it was with the Chronic, is that these songs are all over the place. Some of the songs are really good, but they seem to be just there to make one album, while others are just there to make the album. I can't wait to see what happens when these songs get released on CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a compilation of different rappers and I didn't like the rap music that came out of it. It doesn't have any flow to it. Some songs I would listen to, but I was disappointed because of the lack of flow. A lot of people talk about it being one long song, but the songs are really short. My favorite songs are the ones on the back side because it is more of a song and not just a compilation of rap songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a decent album. I don't know if other people would say it is a good album, but for me it is because I like the way it was made. I like it because I thought it was more of a "classic" album than it was a compilation album. I like the songs that I have heard so far, but I think the best songs were on the backside. The overall album wasn't bad, but I didn't give it a 5 star rating because it wasn't all to my liking.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this for my father because he has liked Dr. Dre in the past. This is a typical Dr. Dre album. Some of the songs are good, but most of the songs are just there to make the album. I like the way that it was made. I think it is a good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is the best that they could have made. This is not a bad album, not a great album, or not an okay album. It's just a good album. The track, "Gone" is really good, and it was the only song that I listened to all the way through. There was only one song that I didn't like when it was on. It was the song "I'm in Love" that was on the backside of the CD. The last song that I didn't like was the song "It's All Over" with the first verse of that song sounding like a person talking to themselves. Other than that, I liked most of this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love both of these artists and I love their albums. This album is better than one would think. I don't know what made me give it a 5 star rating, since it is just above a 3 star rating. I have heard a lot of the songs on this album and I love them. However, there are some songs that I can't stand. Like the song "Gangsta Shit" and the song "It's All Over" are the ones I don't like. I give this album 3 stars because it's kind of like a compilation album. Other than that, I give this album a 5 star rating.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an awesome album, but I feel like it's almost a compilation album. It is an album that is good, but I don't feel like it's really a good album. This album has good songs, but it's not a classic album. I give this album 4 stars because, honestly, it's just a good album.

A:

The problem with this is that the lyrics make it sound like you're going to the gym, and even though it might not be a dance you should do, it's still a dance. 
You should either do one that's not a dance, or the song itself should be changed to something else, because they don't have any lyrics that could be called "dance-y". 
The thing is that you have a lot of songs already on the app, and you can add the ones you like, and the ones you don't like, and the ones that are a bit repetitive, and the ones that are just plain annoying, and the ones that are just plain annoying (that I would say for the same reason), and the ones that are just plain annoying, and the ones that are a bit repetitive, and the ones that just plain annoy you (and you shouldn't even consider keeping this on your phone, it's just that some of them are even worse than the ones you mentioned), and just plain annoy you (and you shouldn't even consider keeping this on the phone, it's just that some of them are even worse than the same song you mentioned), and just plain annoy you (and you should get a new phone), and you don't want to listen to a song that repeats itself at least 2 x over and 10 x over and 50 x over and 150 x over and and... 
The only thing left is this song and the one you mentioned. 
The only thing left is this song and the one you mentioned, which I can't stand either.
The only thing left is this song and the one you mentioned, and the one you mention, which you should get rid of immediately (it's actually the one you mention that is the problem, not the one you should get rid of) and the one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and the only one you mentioned, and the only one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and the one you mention, and the one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and you shouldn't have bought this, so this is what you should do:
Delete the song and the one you mentioned, download the song and the one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and the other one you mentioned, and the other one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and the other one, which is the one you mentioned, and the other one you mentioned, and you shouldn't have bought this, so this was the song you should get rid of and download, and the one you mentioned, and the other one you mentioned, which you shouldn't get rid of immediately, and the one you mentioned, and the other one, which you should get rid of immediately, and the one you mentioned, and the other and the one, which is the one you mentioned, and the other one you should get rid of immediately, and the one you mentioned, and you shouldn't get rid of, and the one you mentioned, and the other one you should get rid of, and the song, and the one you mentioned, and the other one which you should get rid of, and the one you mentioned, and the other one which shouldn't get rid of, and the one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and which you shouldn't get rid of, and the one you mentioned, and which you should get rid of, and the one you mentioned, and which you shouldn't get rid, and the one you mentioned, and which you shouldn't get rid 
And now I deleted all the songs, and there is nothing to add or something to copy (except the one you mentioned) and the one you mentioned, and the one you mentioned, and then I took the one you mentioned, and put it into the app (and I hope you didn't change it, and all the songs you mentioned, and if you did, then you should get rid of them, and you shouldn't get rid of them, but you shouldn't get rid of them, and you shouldn't listen to them, and you shouldn't get rid of them, and you shouldn't do this, and you shouldn't do this, and you shouldn't do this), and I hope you like it, and I hope you like it, and I hope you like it, because I think this is the song you should get

Amazon review:  The Bitch Song is a great song, but I would change the chorus from "I was born to feel that way" to "I was born to feel that way because I love you."  Also, at the very end of the song, there is a part with Billy saying "I was born to feel that way, but you were born to feel that way because I love you."  I don't know if I'm supposed to include that, but it threw me off for a second. I'm not sure if it is correct, but I'm only human, so I didn't want to change it.  Also, the song doesn't flow quite right.  That being said, I would definitely buy it.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, but it doesn't have the same quality that we've come to expect from them, either.  It's just their first album, and I'm not too familiar with their music, so I'd expect it to be better.  They do have a sound though and I'll have to dig further to find flaws.

###
Amazon review: This is the only song on this album that isn't a cover, and I'm happy about that.  I'm not sure how many people will dig this, but for me, it was a little more tolerable than the other ones, so I'll probably wait to listen to the more experimental stuff.

The Best of The 5th Dimension - "I Know"

The 5th Dimension was the number one hit-making duo in the '80s. The duo consisted of producers David Williams and Bernard Edwards. The duo's music is known for its funky funk, a sound that is both old and new at the same time. "I Know" was the duo's first single off the album and is the only one to appear on the album. "I Know" was released in early 1985 and was intended to become the duo's first hit single. "I Know" was written by Williams and Edwards and written by James Newton Howard who also wrote the duo's hit "I Know" which was in turn written by David Williams and Bernard Edwards. The single was released in April 1985 and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the R&B singles chart. The single remained in the top 20 for seven weeks, spending a total of 27 weeks on the chart. The song would later be certified Gold by the RIAA. The single was also released as a 12" vinyl single with a b-side called "Coffee Break" which was a solo version of the song by Bernard Edwards. Both the song and the solo version were also included on the duo's second album, The Very Best of the 5th Dimension. The single was also released on CD in 1987 and peaked at number four on the Hot 100.

Reviewer notes

This DVD release is a copy of the original recording from the soundtrack of the movie "Journey to the Center of The Earth" (1975). The film was made by the same team that did "The Wonderful World of Disney" and was produced by Walt Disney Productions. The music was composed by the band, The Muppets. The soundtrack album was recorded in the studio of Walt Disney Productions and released in 1975. The artwork was done by the artist, Ken Anderson and was published by Tintoretto's.

The DVD version of this soundtrack was originally released in 1998 by Walt Disney/Pioneer. It is a 2-Disc set with the first disc containing the film, and the second disc containing the original soundtrack. The album contains 12 tracks.

This is an excellent soundtrack to the film. The DVD's track selection is not nearly as good as the film, but the audio is good.

The movie "Journey to the Center of The Earth" is about a man who is a scientist who discovers the Earth. He goes to the center of the Earth to collect rocks that will prove that the Earth is flat and find out why he is so certain that the Earth is flat. His journey is very interesting.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I like the music, but it's not for me. I have never been able to enjoy "The Essential" The Beatles. I like the music, but it's not for me.  I've been listening to the Beatles' albums, and not one of them has had my attention for some reason.  I've always loved the songs on the first 4 albums but never been able to find the same enjoyment on any of the albums afterwards.  I guess I am one of those people that has to hear their whole discography before I can say, I've heard it all.  I like the songs on this album, and I like the sound quality, but I just can't find a reason to hear them all.  I just don't have the same enjoyment out of the music on these albums that I do out of the first 4.  It seems like the music on the first 4 is what's been inspiring the music on the albums after.  Also, the album is "incomplete" as far as a complete release, it has 5 songs and 3 songs are incomplete.  I guess that's what it is.  But I am not going to listen to an album that I don't have the interest in.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Because Adam, Ricky and Kevin are not exactly the most famous musicians. The Jonas Brothers are. Maybe that's why you thought they were the best.

The Jonas Brothers:

 

The Jonas Brothers are a popular American singing duo, consisting of sisters (and twin brothers) Jonas (born Kevin) and Niels (born Jorgen). They came to prominence as a result of their appearance on the television show American Gladiators and their appearance on the television show "Total Request Live" with singer Lady Gaga. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

 

The Jonas Brothers are best known for their hit single "I'll Remember" which hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in November 2006. They are also featured on Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" (2006) and on The Jonas Brothers second album "This is Me" (2007).

This band was not very popular in Germany, but they were very popular in the United States.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I bought a Killers album and I am so glad I did. I love it. It was a great purchase. I have two problems though. First of all, the booklet is very small and all the information is in there. I wish they had put the entire booklet out, it would have been much better. Also, the booklet isn't in black and white like the original. It is very dark in color. I don't know why they did this, but it really doesn't make any difference. I still like the album.

Amazon review: I LOVE The Killers! I've been a fan of theirs since I was about eleven. I was a huge fan of them when I was a teenager and I still am. I had a dream to buy a Killers album. When I decided to get one I was excited to hear what it was like. This is the album I have been looking for. It's very dark and the songs are very dark too. My favorite songs are "Catch A Fire" and "Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall". My least favorite is "The Good Side", but that's my personal opinion. I love the cover too.

Amazon review: I bought the Killers album in 1989. It was the last album that the band was to ever do. I have listened to it a few times since then, but not as often as the original release. I thought that the album sounded so different from everything else, so at first I didn't like it. I like it now though. It is a great album. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the dark songs of The Killers.

###
Amazon review: I'm a huge BOC fan and I have been since my earliest days of fandom. I have been listening to the Killers for a long time now, mostly in my car, but I also like to do it in my home now. I can't really put my finger on it, but I feel like the Killers music has a certain quality that I can never come close to in any other band. It is so deep and dark that it is almost hard to listen to the music, but its so mesmerizing. I love it so much that I have bought a Killers album twice. Once as a cassette and once as a CD. Both times the new releases were great too. The Killers are one of the greatest bands, of the 90's and I would like to see them back on earth one day. I will always love their music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, but I have to say that I don't really like this album. I have it in a box to go with my first album and I still listen to it. I guess I just don't like "Catch A Fire" or "Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall". I like the other two songs though. I like "Fever" and "The Good Side".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second Killers album I own and I have to say, I think it is the best. The first one I owned was the one they did with Steve Lukather and Glenn Danzig and they had a much more commercial sound. This one has really grown on me and I am glad I purchased it. The only real downside is that it is quite a bit shorter than the first one, but that's only because they did an acoustic version of "Catch A Fire" and that only happens in the acoustic version. I can't really say that I dislike this one. It isn't a bad album and I still listen to it like the first one was. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little bit dull.
