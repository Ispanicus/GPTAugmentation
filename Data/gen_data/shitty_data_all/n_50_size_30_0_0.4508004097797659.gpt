Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I just love these little teddies, they are adorable and perfect for any occasion and they have such a warm and fuzzy feel to them. I bought one for my daughter's birthday and she cried when I put it under her tree. She really needed to be hugged. I love them.

I'm really glad that I finally made the switch to ebay and it has been much smoother since I decided to sell my items there! It's a whole lot easier to deal with and for the most part has been much better for me. As a matter of fact, the feedback I get from buyers is much better than it was from the other places I dealt with.

I've had a few buyers complain about not being able to reach me when they are ready to pay for the items I sold on ebay. Well, it sounds like that is the case now. It seems that the email address that I put on my account has changed or something I had forgotten to change it to. So I'm having to reset everything at this point.

I've had so many people buy from me in the last few weeks and have received so many positive comments about my items. I'm so glad that I decided to try out ebay and it has been very easy to deal with.

One of the best things about living in an apartment, is that you can have almost everything you need in one building, except the food! It is so nice not having to worry about cooking things all the time, but still having everything in one place. This is of course if you have the time to cook. My parents did have the time and so it has been really nice. Of course, they are still out walking their dog most of the time.

As I've mentioned before, I am very lucky to live in a very nice apartment in a very good school district. I live in the building where I graduated from high school and I have been here for the last 13 years. And even though it is only a block from the high school and my school district, I've never really heard a lot of buzz about the school or the people who care about my school district. I'm not sure why that is, but it is just one of those things.

Anyway, I'm sure you all are wondering how I am doing in life these days. Well, to be honest, I'm really not doing too well. I'm not too

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this was going to be a review of one CD, but instead it's about 20 CDs or so.  I am not even sure how I got this album.  It has a lot of great songs, but the vocals are just horrible, so it's a waste of $20.  I would have rather read about it than listen to it, but I just couldn't help myself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked the original debut album and this album is better.  I think they went too far with the production, but it still sounds like a good song.  I really like some of the songs that are on this album, but most of them are just pretty boring and not the best stuff.  I think they got tired of the formula and went with new sounds and this album is better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I am not sure how many copies of this album I own, but I know I own quite a few.  I bought the first two singles and some of the other songs.  I've been searching for a copy so I can play them on my Ipod.  I guess I will buy the box set, and I will start listening to it now.  I really like this album and I am glad I bought it, but I won't be buying it again.  The songs have gotten better since the last album.  This album has a lot of songs and I really like the overall sound of the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Lil' Bitches" and "Givin' Me The Best" are the only singles on this package, but they are a nice addition because they show that there is more to come from this great band.  My only problem is that the rest of the album is a bit boring and repetitive.  But, I will still buy the box set.  It does have a few nice songs and it is a great album to play on your Ipod or in your car.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album, but there is no single hit that sticks out and makes you say, "I want to hear them again."  There are a lot of decent songs on here, but the vocals are not that great and the production sucks.  This is a good album, but it is not a must have.  You might as well buy the album in its entirety and just listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this album.  I was hoping that they would have a hit and they did not.  However, the album is not bad.  I still like it, it just didn't turn out to be a good album.  I thought it was going to be more of a traditional rock album.  I guess I expected more from them.  They should have been more commercial and not so underground.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think that they are the best underground band around, but they are not a one hit wonder.  I think that the album is good, but I don't think they are the best underground band.  I think the best underground music is the type of music that you can't get on a mainstream radio station or a major label, but you can find it on a mixtape on the internet.  This is the type of underground music I like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am disappointed with this album because it had the worst lyrics that I have ever heard.  They were repetitive and just boring.  When I think of the worst lyrics I think of "I got a secret and she don't know."  It gets old.

###
Amazon review: I don't really like rap.  I like punk rock, metal, and ska.  The album is good, but the lyrics are terrible and it makes me want to punch the person who wrote them.  I have to admit that I like some of the songs and there are some good ones on here.  I do think that the production of the album is a little better than it was on the last album and the songs are not that bad.  I like the cover art and the album title is catchy.  It's a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is one of the best albums I've ever purchased.  It's the type of underground music that I like.  It's got a good mix of traditional and new sounds.

Amazon review: I had never heard this song before and I was floored by the music, the lyrics, the sound.  The worship was powerful and I was touched by the lyrics. The only thing is that he is a huge hypocrite and a liar.  No man should ever be allowed to lie about anything.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music is fun and very much rooted in the old school, "blues" sound.  My only criticism is that there is no discernible message.  I have never heard of this song, but when I read that it was recorded at the National Cathedral, I thought I would give it a listen.  It was a little slow.  I did enjoy the music.  No lyrics, just fun and great sound.

Amazon review: This is such a powerful song that I had to download it to test out.  At first listen, it sounds like a Christian song, but you don't know what they are singing about.

I have shared it with several of my Christian friends and they love it.

Amazon review:  This song is a great rendition of the Lord's Prayer in the Old Testament.  I do not see how it can be a Christian song if it is about "The Lord's Prayer".  This is the Lord's Prayer in the Old Covenant?  If so, I guess Jesus was a little different than us.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I love the old-timey music and it's always inspiring. I'm a college student in the United States and it's hard to find good music for the average college student, especially when they have to pay $19.99 to get the album.  I've only had this CD a couple of times, and I usually don't like new music, but I have to say that I really enjoy this CD.  Its a great listen and I like the songs, but it's not on the level of the old stuff.  I think I'll stick with old-timey songs from the 50's and 60's.

Amazon review: I have always said that I love old-timey music, so when I heard this cd, I was intrigued and I decided to give it a try.

I liked the fact that this track was sung in the old-timey style and that the music and lyrics were very inspirational and I thought it was a very good representation of the album.  I have to agree with the other reviews that this is definitely not a "pro" album, but I would suggest that those who love old-timey music would enjoy it.

It's not the most polished album, but it does have a lot of good songs on it.  The standout tracks are "Chasing the Stars" and "Till the Rain Comes Down."  The chorus in "Chasing the Stars" is awesome.  The other songs, though, are not great.  At least I didn't think they were.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I've got to say I'm pleased with this album.  Robert Johnson was an American artist who wrote some of the best blues songs ever created.  His music is very unique, very well done, and very personal.  I love his music.  I'm very glad I bought this album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I love this album. It's on my playlist when I want to listen to a solid hip hop album, not too many beats. As far as the vocals go, I do have to agree with duke on this one. If I'm being honest, I think he could have been better but still, I like his style. I also like the cover art and I think it's a good representation of his style. I don't understand why everybody hates this album. It's not good, but it's not awful either.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Good album. The only thing, and I know this is going to sound awful, but I've been doing this for a while, is that I usually don't listen to it, but when I do.. I'll usually listen to it. So that's the only thing that would be annoying, for me, about listening to this album for the first time. It's really not that bad of a album. But when I listen to it though, I don't really seem to care. I just don't really listen to much hip hop.. I'm sure I'll get better with the years, but it's not like I've been doing it forever. But I'll always listen to this album. I love it.

Amazon review: I can't believe I haven't made a review for this album yet. I love this album! It's like a super hardcore hip hop album. The only thing that I would like to mention is that I agree with duke on this one. I think he could have been better but still, I like his style, I wish he would stop going on and on about how he's gonna be better but he won't be. He's not a real rapper. This album is solid. The only bad thing I have to say about this album is the song "The Spy Hunter." I don't even listen to this song, I don't even know what it is. But I can tell you from personal experience that the song is not that good. The song just sounds like a watered down version of Lil Wayne. I don't even listen to Lil Wayne, and I really don't care what he has to say. But I just thought I would mention that. All in all though, this album is good and I'm glad I got it.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album, I think it is one of the best hip hop albums ever. I'm really impressed with the diversity on this album. This album is so different from his previous albums. There are a lot of different styles, from the old school hip hop style, to the more rock style. There are a few different styles, but overall this album is so diverse. I love how he took a lot of his influences and made them his own. It really shows that he is a true hip hop artist. The album is a great combination of different styles, and I think it shows his growth. I have been listening to this album for a long time now, and I still think it is one of the best albums of all time. I will probably listen to it again and again.

Amazon review: I first stumbled upon this album on the NPR show, "Morning Edition."  I was captivated by the first song, "You're a Reason." It's really catchy and has a wonderful melody to it.  I also really liked "My Life."  It's one of the few songs I can actually hum to myself without thinking, making me feel good.  I love the little bit of background vocals on the other songs as well.  Each song has a different feeling to it that I enjoy.  It's a great mix of classic rock, folk, and pop.  I think this album is great and I'm looking forward to listening to the rest of the albums.

When I listen to it, I can't help but think about the great times I've had with my family and friends.  It's like I'm transported to my happy place and I feel like I can feel the music going through my ears.  It makes me feel happy and I love it.  I love the little bit of background vocals on the other songs.  I love the way they feel.

Amazon review: I really love this album.  I think the one thing I absolutely hated was the last song.  I didn't care for it much and I wish I could have liked it better.  I wish it was longer.  I would have really liked to have heard more background vocals as well.  I don't have any problems with the lyrics, I could understand most of them.  The only two I didn't really understand were "You're a Reason" and "My Life."  The lyrics on the last song were kind of stupid.  It was a bit over the top.  They didn't make much sense to me.  I was kind of embarrassed by it, but I kind of like it.  I think this album is great and I'm looking forward to the rest of the albums as well.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The lyrics are written in the style of a '50's song about a girl who's coming home after being away, so you can tell right away that the author is a fan of a certain type of music.  The song is really good, but I would not buy the album.  I will listen to it as a separate album.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After I got into these guys, I thought they were kind of cheesy. But they do have a lot of soul. Then I heard they had a new song they added to the CD, "I'm a Good Man." I really liked that song, so I bought it later. But I was shocked to find out that I had a copy of the CD from 1997. I feel like a kid again. The CD is ok but I'm hoping for a new release in '99! I still like the band.
