Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: Wow, I've got to say this was one of my favorite songs.  It was on the radio when I was in high school and I have never forgotten it.  It's by the band Savage Garden.  I think the lyric is so sweet, the chorus is so catchy, and I love the way it tells a story about a teenage love affair.   I have listened to this song about a million times and I think it's my favorite song.  The only thing that would make it better is if the bass player sang along with the chorus.  But I will say this, this song is different because the vocals are really powerful and not like other songs that are more on the mellow side.  I would say the lyrics are really sweet.  It was such a great song that I was sad to see that it is no longer available but I am glad that it is available now.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the second song from Savage Garden that I have heard and it is a great song.  I love it because it tells a wonderful story and it is one of my favorites.  I listen it in the morning when my mind is ready to start thinking about something, and when I am at work with my computer and I listen to this song and I start to fall asleep.  It's a great song.  It is the second song that I have heard in one day and I'm still amazed that it sounds so great.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It's awesome, and I love the lyrics that are so touching.  I really think this song shows the true feeling that the band had while they were creating these songs.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

The only thing I don't really like about this album is that the music is in a very poor quality. There is either too much or too little, so you can't really listen to all of the songs at the same time. I also don't like the fact that there is no lyrics, and that it's just the music and vocals.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

I like the fact that it is a rock album, yet I don't feel like it is too far out there.  I like it because it is a little different.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this company because they are different than most.  I love the idea, but I didn't feel like it was any different from the big box stores.  The beats sound a little cheap and are a little hard to play with.  I would definitely try them out.  They sound like they were made by someone who has not really played the instrument.  I guess that's the only way to truly appreciate a good instrument.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the sound of the instrument, I play it daily.  I've been buying the original beats for years.  I love em, and they make my house sound good!

Amazon review: I have never heard of this company before, but I have to agree.  The sounds are not the same as the original beats.  If I can't beat it, I won't buy it.  The beats are not the same, and the artist is a rip off.  I don't know who is the artist or what the name is, but I have to agree with other reviews.  This beats are not the beats I remember in the old days.  I think if you want good beats, you can go to a store selling original beats, but if you want good new beats, you have to go here.  It's a rip off.  I will not buy it again.

It's the original beats that you have to be careful about because the new generation beats sound so different.  I don't think this beats sound like the originals.  It's the originals that sound like the originals, but I don't know that this

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

The song is very, very catchy.  I love that the lyrics are in the third person.  I love that the lyrics are in the third person about a guy with no name.  I love that the lyrics are in the third person about a girl with no name.  I love that it is in the third person about a girl with no name and a guy with no name.  I love that the lyrics are in a different language than that of the original.  I love that it is not about a person with no name.  I love that it is not about a girl with no name and a guy with no name.  But the lyrics are in the third person, third person, third person, third person for a guy with no name and a girl with no name and a guy with no name.  I don't know what to do.

Amazon review: I thought this album was going to be a terrible disappointment.  The band is very good, and they have a very interesting sound.  There are three cover songs on this CD.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If yo listen to the lyrics, terrible!  nice, pop melody though which is probably why it's so popular.

Amazon review: This is exactly what you'd expect from a band that's always been known for their energetic, catchy tunes and their rousing live shows. The fact that I have yet to see the band live doesn't mean they aren't as good live as they are on record, but this is a great song.  This is one of the most memorable of all their songs.  I would say it's very catchy and the chorus is very catchy too.  It's a great song and I definitely look forward to whatever they do next.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first half of the album is pretty decent, but the second half is a complete mess. Not sure of the reason why this track is so popular, but it is one of the top 5 songs along with "The Promise" and "Bark at the Moon".

Amazon review: The album was released in April 2005 and is in my opinion one of the best albums of 2005. This band never does it like this. This band always puts out quality material.  I was surprised at how good this song is. It's the best song on the album.

Amazon review: The second single, "Bark at the Moon" peaked at #14 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.  The song has a very strong and powerful melody with a very catchy beat.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."

I'm not a fan of Bob Dylan.  I don't know why I like him.  I wish he would quit writing these songs.  And how does he write an entire song in the same tone of voice?  I guess that's one of the things that made his other works so great.  He just kept on.  But, this was a great song!  It was so good that I had to go and buy it.

I will say this though:  I don't like his new songs.  Not that they aren't good, but it is my opinion that he should stick to his hits.  I think he is good, but I am not a fan of his new songs.  I don't really like him.  He reminds me of someone else.  I don't know if it's his voice or his music or the way he writes his songs.  It is a good song too, but that does not make up for his new songs.  My favorite songs are the ones he wrote before he became famous.  Some of his new songs, I don't care for the lyrics.

Amazon review: I loved this album when I bought it last year.  This new re-release is even better.  Every time I listen to this album I'm always amazed that these guys are still making music.  I've purchased a lot of songs by these guys over the years and I've always enjoyed them.  But this album is just as good as their previous releases.  The new album has a great mix of the old and the new.  It feels like these guys have always been doing this for a long time and are really having fun making new things.  I also like the fact that this album has great vocals.  The old songs are great because they're just so overplayed.  But the new ones are really good.  I really liked this album and while I don't plan on buying anything by this guy ever again.
