Amazon review: Being a band nerd, I like listening to band music.  This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.  I was selected to play in the KKPsi/TBS National Intercollegiate Band in 1993, and we performed his "A Walk in Jurassic Park".

Amazon review: I found this CD in my car. I've never heard this song before. I thought it was just an obscure song from a band I don't know, but it turns out this is the debut single by The National.  When I first heard this song, I was blown away.  It's really good.  I never thought I'd like a song sung by a band named The National.  Now I think I do.  I'm sorry I was wrong.  I still like it.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of The Steve Boalt Band since they were in high school.  I had heard of this CD from a friend who had gotten it.  I bought it a few times over the years and finally got it.  Now it's the only CD I will listen to.  The sound is not what someone would expect from a CD.  Its so different, I can't put it into words.  If you like any other music and you're looking for something different from the past, this is worth the price of the CD.  I love the sound of it.  For the money, you get a great CD.  If you can't afford it, then support a cause that can help people.

Amazon re-review of The Steve Boalt Band's first CD "Darkest Before Dawn"

The Steve Boalt Band are a band out of Austin, TX, who have gained a great deal of attention through songs such as "Pimp", "Gangster Gangster" and "In da Club". Their music is all over the radio and their song "Pimp" is getting constant play on MTV and other music channels. The band has also been featured in the Austin Chronicle and many other publications, and have been the subject of articles in the San Francisco Chronicle and other publications.

As I was listening to this CD, I was taken away by the raw energy and the energy of the band. At one point, I was so excited that I almost started to dance. The music was so raw, that I became very, very excited. When I listened to it a second time, I was even more excited and wanted to dance even more. I love this band.

The band's music is very different, at times it seems like it is trying to be some sort of country music. I like that and I like that they are able to do very different things with the songs. I think that the lyrics have some very interesting things to say and it is easy to get caught up in the lyrics. I think that it is one of the bands I like the most. The lyrics are very well written and have a lot of emotions.

I have tried to find out more information about the band and was surprised to see that there is a whole website that is dedicated to the band. The band has an interesting history and it is quite fascinating. I have taken the time to dig through the information on the site and I am still so amazed that I can't put it into words. The site is very informative and has a lot of information on the band.

It has been a very good experience buying The Steve Boalt Band's first CD. I have bought several of their other CDs and have enjoyed each one of them as well. I highly recommend this CD, especially to those who love the band or who have been fans of the band.

In closing, I would like to say that The Steve Boalt Band is a band I would like to see on the radio. They have a unique sound and the music is so raw and raw, that it is extremely hard not to become addicted to the music. I think they are a very talented band and I hope to see them on the radio very soon.

For my money, this CD is worth it. I would recommend this CD to anyone that loves country music.

I've been a fan of the Steve Boalt bands for years. They are great live. They are also a great live act. And they are a great live act, when they are on. They are very well known in Austin, TX, and the state. Their sound is raw, and their live show is very raw. It's very easy to follow and get into their music. This is a great CD that you'll enjoy.

I've bought a few of their CDs. I love them. Some of their CDs are great, some of them are not so good. But I can still enjoy them. I was very excited to find them. They are a great live act. I like them.

I am not a fan of country music bands, but I still buy their CDs. I do it mostly for the music. The songs are not too bad. I have bought quite a few of their CDs. They are very good.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

Amazon review: I thought I would give this a go to add some new flavor to my mix.  I've got a lot of old stuff like this.  I love the beat, but I don't think the vocals match the music.  They just don't sound like someone from a band or a singer.  I would have preferred if the vocals matched the beat, but I'll keep it anyway.  I might like to mix it with other songs and see where it goes.  I wish I got a little more variety, but the vocals are pretty much all the same and the music is kind of boring.  I like the music, but not the vocals.  I think the vocals are good and the beat is good, but they don't go together well.

Amazon review: I was really impressed with this mix.  I've always liked the song.  I think it would be fun to put in a different remix of the song, or maybe a live version or something.  I would put it in a band with another song, for example.  I would put it in a band like this.

Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: Excellent work of art.  She's on target with every song.  Seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative, bad girl image.  Some people want to boycott her album until she gets help but there's no question, this is a top quality production.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review: The songs are great.  I like the diversity of the songs.  The different styles and the different textures make the album interesting.  The songs are mostly good, with the exception of "Hear the Wind Blow" which is not as good as the other songs.  I like the way the album flows.  The lyrics are not as good.  The vocal styles are not consistent.  I have read that some of the songs are influenced by the movie "Bridget Jones's Diary" but I have not seen the movie.  Maybe I should buy it.  There are some great songs on this album.  The only reason I do not recommend it is the songs are too similar to the Beach Boys' albums.  I guess I shouldn't get too excited about a CD that is not worth buying, but I still like the CD a lot.

The album does not have any songs that are not by the Beach Boys.  I'm disappointed that they did not have the whole album on the CD.  I was hoping for a complete Beach Boys' collection.  By the way, the CD player at my house does not have CD capability.  The CD player is a standard CD player with nothing added to the CD.  It is a simple CD player.  There is nothing special about the CD player.  I think it is a very basic CD player.  I like the fact that it has a CD player.  It does not have a CD/DVD player.  This CD makes me wonder why the CD/DVD player is not included with the CD player.  I have not figured out the answer to that yet.  I have never had a CD player that did not have a CD/DVD player.

I don't know why they are on this album.  I wonder if they feel that they owe the Beach boys something for the songs that they have been singing for the past 30 years.  I'm not sure.  I hope that they are not trying to make a profit by selling this album.  If so, it would be a very stupid act.  They already have some of the best songs on this album.  I think that the songs on this album would make a better CD.  I don't know what to say about it.  I don't know if I am supposed to be happy or sad.  I guess I am not supposed

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

Amazon review: This song is the ultimate love song.  The most popular love song (and it is one of my favorites) not only because it's funny and catchy, but because it's got a really good melody to it.  This song will keep me dancing till the end of time.  If you want to do the same, then this is the song for you.  If you want to listen to it again, make sure you listen to it more than once.  Its pretty much a song that needs to be listened to over and over.  The repetition will drive you insane.  This song is perfect to listen to in the shower.  Its that good.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: The songs are great, but the audio quality is so bad that I want my money back.  It it a static-filled, compressed mess and it's pretty hard to listen to.  Whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album.  Waiting for the remaster.

Amazon review: I am a huge Floyd fan.  I love everything since Dark Side, and much from before Dark Side.  I love post-Waters Floyd, Floyd with Roger Waters, and  I love a lot of the solo songs from Waters, from Gilmour, and from Wright.  I didn't enjoy this album.  I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is not a Floyd album.  It is a collection of songs that have been done before, by other musicians, and have been released as "floppies" as a means of getting around copyright issues.  This is not a Floyd album, it's a collection of songs that have been done before, by other musicians, that have been released as "floppies" as a means of getting the song recorded, and then sold to the public as a "flip". This is very similar to the situation with The Beatles "White Album."  The only difference is that it's a copy of the original, and you can only buy one copy of the original, or one for each member of the band.  For the most part, this is a terrible, misguided attempt to cash in on a copyright issue.  Floyd does have some great songs, and does deserve to be recognized, but this is not a Floyd album.  This is a collection of songs that have been done before, by other musicians.  This is a waste of Floyd's talents.  At the end of the day, the music has nothing to do with the copyright issue.  This is a bad, bad, terrible idea.  If you buy this, you are buying the original.  If anything, you are buying a copy.  A copy is a copy, regardless of whether it is a "flip" or not.  This should be renamed "The Original - Flips".  This album is the original, and should be considered as such.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a perfect example of why every album needs to be given a "flip" and then sold as such with the original copies sold to the public.  I've been a Floyd fan for years, and I'm not going to stop listening to the album because of this.  The songs are very similar to each other, and the same with the solo's by Gilmour and Wright.  I love the songs, but I don't love these albums.  This album is a waste of Floyd's talents, and I hope it is never released.

Some of you may wish to buy this Chicago album because, foolishly like me, you want to listen to the music and songs of the guys in 'Chicago', but you get to listen to the compositions of :  1- 'Dannay Orton',  2- 'Blair Daly',  3- 'Greg Barnbill',  4- 'Dennis Matkosky',  5- 'Chas Sandford',  6- 'Jay DeMarcus',  7- 'Brett James',  8- 'George Hawkins Jr.',  9- 'Marcus Hummon',  who are not in the band.  With only 1 song (out of 12) written entirely by a band member, apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producers think so.

Amazon review:  I used to be a huge fan of Randy  Moore's music, and I loved his album 'The Last Frontier', and I have great respect for Randy Moore, as an artist, and his work as a musician.  But even though this album is a great collection of music (a lot of his fans had not heard his earlier work, so I am looking forward to hearing it), I am saddened by the fact that this album does not contain a single song by Randy Moore.  Randy Moore is an amazing singer, and many of his songs have great messages about Jesus Christ, but as far as I can tell, he has never recorded a song about Jesus Christ.  
I know that this is a personal opinion, but this is my opinion.  
If you are a fan of Randy Moore, or of God, please, buy one of his other albums, (his first album was a great collection of music)  and do not buy this album.  It is not necessary, and I am not trying to make you feel guilty.  I just am a fan of Randy Moore, and I am a fan of God.  
However, if you are a fan of Randy Moore, I would like to see him record a song about Jesus Christ, and please, buy his other albums.  
If you are a fan of Randy Moore, please, buy one of his other albums  and give Randy Moore his due.

However, I will say that Randy Moore is not a very nice person.  He is very selfish & narcissistic.  
I know that this is a personal opinion, but I just can't stand Randy Moore. 
I am very sorry that I am not a fan of Randy Moore, and I am sorry that I am not a fan of Jesus Christ.  
If you are a fan of Jesus Christ, I wish you to know that Jesus Christ loves you.  
I know that this is a personal opinion, but Jesus Christ loves you.  
I wish you to be a better person who loves Jesus Christ.  
I wish you to be kind to everyone who is not a Christian.  
I wish you to be good to everyone who is not good to you.  
I wish you to be a better person who cares about Jesus Christ.

Amazon review: I couldn't download all 930 or so mp3s from the cloud player without clicking them 1 at a time. However, thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free, I was able to find the site "bible.is". On that site they have the complete Bible, plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized versions of KJV, NASB, ESV, and contemporary English. If this product didn't need to be downloaded through cloud player, I would have given it a 4/5 stars.

It arrived soon enough, however when I listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the CD. This is really disappointing. I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it. The songs aren't as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to  have one track list on the CD and another on the CD cover.

Amazon review: This album was just a simple mix of other records that I already owned. I like the beats, but I can't stand the lyrics on most of the tracks. The only good song is "No Love", it's just a very simple rap. The next song "No Love" is the most annoying track with the worst lyrics and is just a song about a girl. It's awful. The other tracks are not as bad as that one, but there are some good ones like "No Love", "Krafty", "I Wanna" and "Hip Hop" and many others.

Amazon review: This is my fav band to play in a band with.  I think we are a good band.  I have played with them before and felt what I wrote here.  We sound good together and our sound is all over the place.  We can make any song sound awesome.  We aren't all going to be in a band or something like that, we just want to be able to play music and create a sound that is unique to each person in the band.  I think that is what makes us different from many other bands.  I like that about us, I can relate to what everyone else is going through, everyone is going through something, I relate to that too.  We are just trying to get the best out of ourselves.  We're all on the same band for that.  We have a good time doing it.  We like the same music and we like to play it together.  We don't try to copy other bands or anything.  We just want to get better as a band and as musicians.  We like to play new music and to create a sound that is unique to each person in the band.  We play the songs that we personally like.  We don't want to play songs that all everyone else likes.  We don't try to copy other bands or anything.  It's just a good band that play music.  I feel like there is a lot of music out there that is very good, but it's not for us, we don't want to play music from bands that all other people like.  That is something we are very much against, we don't want to play music that has been done before.  We want to create our own sound and that's what we are trying to do here.  We want to do it our way.  To be honest we are trying to sound like nobody else.  We are trying to sound like we are making the song we are making on our own.  We want to make our own sound and make our own music.  We want to have our own brand of music and we want to make that our way.  We are trying to be our own band.  We are trying to do our own thing.  I think we are doing it right now.  We may become better as time goes on, I am not too sure because we play a lot of different music, but at least we are trying our best and we believe in it.  I think we are doing it right now.  I don't know how long we will be playing or even if we will be playing next year, I don't know.  I know we are going to be playing again next year, if we don't stop by the end of the year, it will be next year for sure.  I don't want to get into any specifics because it's not gonna make me happy, but I will say this.  I do think that we are doing it right now.  We have a lot of good people who want to make music, but we don't have the time or maybe the money or maybe we lack the creativity.  That's why I said I will say this, we are trying to do our own thing.  We are trying to make our own brand of music, we are trying our best.  I believe in this band.  I believe in us.  I believe in us.  I believe in this band.  I believe in us.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

I would listen to their first three albums if I were going to listen to music.  They have always stayed true to their sound.

Overall, I think they have improved a lot since the first two Killers albums.  I think this album would be better as a single album.

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Nessun Dorma bar none and I include in this, Pavrotti, Domingo, etc. Although they are supposedly more tecnically correct, I am so taken by the emotion in Boccelli's voice that there is no comparison for me.

Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

Amazon review: CSN, "Deja Vu", "After The Gold Rush". These were the albums that helped to define an era for some of us. "CSN" never supassed that first album, either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums. Neil Young was able to transcend the era, that is why he still is a vital recording artist. Nostalgia makes me sad. I don't need it.

Amazon review: This is a very superb piece of worship music!  Except that it is cut at the end.  tragic end for such a fine piece of music.  This music is on a par with Heilig, by Schubert, sung by the Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge.  These two are in a class by themselves as beyond superb.  However, this one is ruined by being cut short at the end, before the music is finished.

Amazon review: My favorite of the all time.  This one is not on the album, but it is definitely up there.  There are so many excellent songs on this one, I could listen to it all day.  I love the way the singer has control of the sound, and the overall feel of the song.  I especially love the opening song, "I've Been Waiting For Me", and the closing song, "I'll Be Here For You".  It's not often I get a song with beautiful harmonies that are so good.

Amazon review: This is a very nice album.  With a good voice, and a good song to start with, you can't go wrong here.  This album is very popular in the '80's, but is very popular in the '70's as well, with lots of songs on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album isn't a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth a listen.  Most of the songs on this disc are great, and some are even great for the whole album.

Amazon review: This album is the one that made me a fan of Neil Young.  I'm not saying it's a bad album, there are a few great songs on here, but overall I think it's a mediocre sounding album, with some good songs on it.  I like Neil Young, I really do, but Neil Young is very inconsistent.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the album, I do and I think it's very good.  However, I think that when you listen to it, it's kind of hard to understand what you're listening to, and it sounds like two people singing at the same time!  I have heard a lot of people say the same, and I think it's kind of stupid, but I like what I hear.  I like Neil Young because I like Neil Young, but I like it, too, and so do a lot of people, even though it's not that great.  I'm a Neil Young fan, I am, very much so.  I like what I like, and I like listening to him.  I'm a huge Neil Young fan.  His songs are good.  I think it's very good.  I think it's good for a lot of reasons.  I like what I like, and I like Neil Young, and I like his songs, and I like listening to them.  It's very good.  I just don't know how to explain it.

Amazon review: This is the best of the Neil Young albums, but this album is not meant to be a compilation of Neil Young songs.  The songs here are all great, with a few great exceptions.  I think Neil Young is very inconsistent, but he's very creative, and he's very good at expressing himself, and he's a great artist.  He's a good artist.  I think this album is very good, but I don't think there is anything particularly great about it.  I think it's very good, but it's not the best album Neil Young has ever recorded, it's just very good, and the only thing I can think is that it's not that great, but that's not bad at all, it's just not that great.  It's not the best album Neil Young has ever recorded, but it's good.  I don't think that Neil Young is consistent.  I think he's an inconsistent artist.  I think he's good at expressing himself, but he's not consistent.  I think there is some inconsistency.  I think there's a lot of inconsistency in his music.  All right, I hope you like it, because you're welcome to try to like it, and even like it, if you like what you hear.  I hope you like it, because I like it a lot, and I think it

Amazon review: I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

Gary is a real talent and his musical abilities are well above what most of us can appreciate. He has a wonderful, soothing voice, a strong, clear and powerful instrument and is able to write his own music without the help of an engineer! I would recommend Gary's music to anyone who enjoys music.

However, you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record.

It is like the speaker was blown, very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music.

Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one.

I have a deep faith in God that I can stand to be weak and fall and I can stand to be strong and rise again."  It is a message I need to hear often.

Amazon review: I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today. I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [.]. of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this. When you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [explicit] but one that is clean has nothing like [censored] or [clean] next to it.  Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

Amazon review: This song is a great single and I like the way it sounds. It's like a cross between a country song and a song from a movie. I don't know how to explain it, but it's just a great song.  I'm still sad about the Chris Brown thing, but this song is what makes me feel better about things. It's just a perfect song.

Amazon review: I will be honest and say I had no idea what I was looking at when I downloaded this song. I had heard of the song before and I had downloaded it on the assumption that it was a bootleg that was only available through bootleg sites. I didn't think that it was that bad of a song and it sounded fantastic.  I then played this song again and thought to myself, "This is exactly what I need right now."  It was just perfect to calm my nerves as I waited to see if my friend was going to show up.  I was waiting for him and I knew he would be coming, but I could tell that it was going to be a while.  When he did show up, I was so happy that I could just cry.  This is such a beautiful song, one of the best I have ever heard. I believe that it is a truly beautiful song, but when I first heard it I didn't know what it was.  I am not a person that is easily impressed, but this song is just something that I need right now.  I am so happy that I purchased it.  I feel that something like this is what I need in my life right now.  This song will be on my list of songs to listen to for a long time.  So if you are looking for a great song to listen to, this is it.  The song is perfect for all situations.  I hope you enjoy it just as much as I do.

Amazon review: She cannot even do a soft song without it being at the Schubert or O'Neil Theater. I would suggest you get the ala carte from her massive library here at iTunes. There ARE some great things.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the "chorus" at the end of this song.  It's a little bit too long for my taste, and it seems to have all the instruments playing at once, but I don't mind at all.  I think it's a great song for any type of performance.  I would recommend listening to it first on your headphones, and then putting them on the speakers and enjoying it through the headphones.  But I wouldn't recommend putting it on the stereo, since the stereo can't handle the loud drums.  It's kind of a tough call, but I think it's best to hear the song on headphones.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the track as a whole, and the first half is great.  I know it's a bit of a cliché, but I love the solo.  And the rest of the track is nice, too, but I think the first half is better.  I would recommend picking this album up and listening to it first, as the first half is a little bit boring.

Amazon review: I really don't think this is a good track.  It's a great one, though.  It really puts a smile on your face, and I love the chorus.  But I don't think it's a good track as a whole.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of her Schubert and other classical music.  I agree with the other reviewers.  I love her classical music, and I love this song.  I'm only one person, but I love this song.  I can't wait to listen to it again.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It's a great song. There's a great guitar solo that I just love.  I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do with it if I'm listening to it on headphones, though.  I think it would be a great song either way, but it depends on how much I want to listen to it through my headphones, so I would recommend listening to it on headphones first.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I do not know why I like this so much.  I am a huge fan of the Schubert and other classical music, and this song is just plain boring.

Amazon review: I like this album.  It's a great album.  I love her classical music, and this is one of her best albums.  The solo guitar is so good.  The song is great, and the first half of the song is great.  I would definitely recommend this, but it doesn't really have much to recommend it.  It's okay, but it's a little bit of a drag.  I don't really think you can say anything really good about this album.  It's just okay.  I would recommend this, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I would recommend you to go listen to a different album first.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: I downloaded this song based on the clip, without having any knowledge that there's a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur.  The spoken word portion has a good point that I agree with overall, but it renders this song unplayable in my household.  I wish I could return an MP3.  I'm utterly, utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning.  I now have serious doubts about downloading other song from Amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety.

Amazon review: I am a little late to join the party when it comes to this artist, but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for Thinking Out Loud on youtube (I didn't realize it had been played to death on the radio according  to friends)  I love  the cd. It is awesome to find an artist that actually plays real instruments, writes their own music, with lyrics that actually convey human emotions. Wonders never cease.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.

Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.
