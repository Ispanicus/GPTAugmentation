Amazon review: I bought this album for the cover art alone, I was so happy when I got it.  As it turned out, this is just as bad as the first album, and not nearly as good.  I was disappointed with the production too, I couldn't tell if it was an EMI or Warner Bros.  I know that Warner Bros. is in control of the release of this album, but I can't imagine why they would put this out on EMI, it's a total mess.  I would have preferred a nice, clean, modern pop song with some nice melodies to it.  This album is just not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  I bought it with the cover.  I wish it was all in one LP, it's a bit of a mess.  The song "I Want You Back" is the only one I liked, but the rest are just plain terrible.  It's the first album that I bought on the Internet, so I don't know what to say about it, but I don't think I'll be buying any more EMI/Warner Bros. releases or albums from EMI in the future.

Amazon review: I have two albums by EMI on my iPod (one is "Maggie May" and the other one is this one), and I don't see how one of them is worse than the other, unless they had the same producer/engineer.  This is not the worst album, it's not even a bad album, it just kind of sucks.  There are lots of crappy pop songs, and not a lot of real songs.  If you can find one good song in this album, you can find one good song in almost anything EMI puts out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard this album a million times, but still I listen to it over and over.  It's always fresh, no matter how many times I have heard it.  I know some people have said it's not "real" pop, but I just think it's a great pop album.  I don't think there's a single song that I don't like, it's just what I like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album 5 times.  This is the first album by EMI that I have ever bought.  I have bought many other albums by EMI, and every one has been a waste.  This album is the only one that I have bought for the cover, and it's the only one that I have ever bought for the actual sound quality.  The lyrics are okay, I admit.  The only time I really felt like the lyrics were not sung was during the song "Honey Don't" and "I Want You Back".  I didn't know why the lyrics didn't relate to the music, but I knew it was something else when "I Want You Back" was over.  The music is great, but the lyrics are terrible.  They just don't match up at all.  They just don't make any sense.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am giving this album a B minus.  It's a mess on purpose.  The album is a mess.  It's terrible.  I have listened to this album 5 times, and I just don't get it.  It's very boring, and it's not catchy.  It's probably one of the worst pop albums ever made.  It's not even a good album, it's just a bad album.  And it's not one of those albums that I really like, it's just an album that I don't like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with this review.  I've listened to this album a lot, and I agree that it isn't for me.  I don't have any problems with the album, it just doesn't sit right with me.  The only thing that I can think of is that some songs are too long, or not long enough.  I don't really see what the problem is with the lyrics, the music is really beautiful.  I don't think I've ever heard a single song that is more beautiful than this one.  The only thing that I would say that I don't care for from a pop album is the fact that the album was produced by a woman named Tanya Donelly.  She was the producer of "The Bump" and many other EMI albums.  However, she is very popular, and she is an amazing singer.  She deserves

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: "Plastic" was a great album, but I'm not sure what the point is with "I Can't Wait" and "I've Got Life" and "The Only One."  What's wrong with simply not making a point?  I can't wait to listen to "I Can't Wait" again and again and again, over and over, for the rest of my life.  I have no idea what the point is with "I Can't Wait" and "I Have Life."  I have no idea if it is a good or bad thing that I can't wait to listen to "I Can't Wait" again without feeling the same ache and heartbreak that I felt when listening to it for the first time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "I've Got Life" is the best song on this record.  The lyrics in this song were written for and by someone who was going through the same thing that I am, going through the same love-hate relationship with my girlfriend.  It's one of those love songs that puts you at ease and helps you to understand each other.  The melody is so beautiful.  I am really enjoying this album.  The only two songs that I didn't like on this album were "I Can't Wait," "I've Got Life," and "The Only One."  The two I don't like are "The Only One" and "I Can't Wait."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "I've Just Seen A Face" is one of the best songs on this album.  "I've Just Seen A Face" is the first song I ever heard on the radio.  I was 11 years old when it came on.  I have never been able to listen to the radio until now.  "I've Just Seen A Face" is a song that makes you glad that you are alive.  I am not sure what is wrong with this song.  I am pretty sure that if I were to hear the lyrics to this song I would be so happy to be alive.  I have not heard lyrics to this song since I was 11 years old.  I have not been able to sing this song since I was 11 years old.  I have only been able to listen to this song for the first time since I was 11 years old in 1995.  This song makes me feel happy and lucky that I have the opportunity to live.  I have not been able to listen to this song for the past ten years.  I have only been able to listen to this song for an hour since I was 11 years old.  This song makes me feel lucky that I have the opportunity to live.  The only song on this record that I do not like is "I've Got Life."  On this record I do not like "I've Got Life," "The Only One," "I Can't Wait," and "The Only One."  The only song that I do not like on this record is "I Can't Wait."

This is a review of the band's album "Plastic."

This album is fantastic, but unfortunately, there are some missteps.  This album has so many great songs, but the one flaw is that there are one or two songs on the album that you can't get out of your head, like "Plastic," "The Only One," and "You Were Right."  "You Were Right" is my favorite song on the album, and it is because I can't get it out of my head, even after hearing it so many times.  I think that this song has a lot of depth.  It is really about a girl who wants to let someone know how she really feels, but she is afraid to tell the person because she has never felt this much heartbreak before.  I think that this song is awesome because it has a really different sound to it, and that makes it really interesting.  I also like the fact that this song has a great message about how a person can't tell the person how they really feel about them even though they are the one who has made them feel this way.  I think that this song is really great because it encourages the listener to realize how lucky they are to be alive and to be able to sing the song.  There are so many other great songs on the album, but these are my favorite three.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  It is my third Plumb album, and this album is no exception to that.  The album is definitely more pop-friendly, but it is still very much a good album.  I think that "I Can't Wait," "I've Got Life," and "Plastic" are all great songs.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

I think it was because of the fact that I can't really remember the music of that era without being reminded of the 80's.  I also really enjoyed the music from the 70's and I think that was the most enjoyable period of music for me.  I didn't really like some of the music from the 80's and the 90's.  My favorite music from that era was "The Wizard of Oz" soundtrack.  I've never been a huge fan of the movie but I think that soundtrack is what made me fall in love with the music from that era.  I think the music of that era has a special place in my heart because it's the music I grew up with.  I've been a big fan of music ever since I was a little kid.

I did get involved with some of the music of that era while I was going there and I can honestly say that I haven't been as engaged in the music as I am now.

Amazon review: I don't know what it is about this era but for the most part they didn't have much great music.  The music I like from this era is the kind of music you listen to in the car when you're listening to some of your friends.  And it's usually the kind of music you put on before something else you're listening to.  It's the kind of music you listen to when you fall asleep at night.  The music that made my day was the kind of music you heard while you were working in the office.  This music has some of that kind of feeling to it.  I like the music of this era because it reminds me of the music my mom listened to when I was a kid.  I also have heard some of the music that has been played at my graduation.  There were some really good songs being played at that time.  I've never been a big fan of the music of this era but I do like some of the music of the 80's and 90's.  I just wish the music of this era had more of a personal touch.  I mean, the music is good but I wish they would have given it more focus.

He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

The second record of Josh Groban's holiday album is out in Japan. I can't wait to see Josh's face when he's singing this record.  I love the album because it has a great mix of covers, original songs and some new material.  I also like the fact that Josh has a lot of Christmas songs on the album.  I don't like that the songs are so long.  I think that Josh can sing a lot of songs with just three or four words.  I would like to see him do more songs like that.  I would like to hear him sing songs like "White Christmas" and "Frosty the Snowman" and "I love you, too".  I don't like that "I'll Be Home for Christmas" is not on the album.  I like it better than on the CD.

Josh Groban has released two new holiday albums. The first of the two new albums is called "Frosty the Snowman". In order to get in to buy the album, you have to go to Josh's official website. You go to the "Christmas Music" section then you click on "Christmas Songs". You then choose the album, and then you can buy it from the "Buy" section. I think that Josh's music will be very popular on the Internet in the future. I am sure that some people are going to buy it for Christmas. His songs are not only very popular, but they are also very good. I like how Josh's voice sounds on the album. His voice has a very soft and gentle sound to it.  I like how he sings some of the songs that are on the album. I like that he sings songs that he has recorded before.  I am sure that when you hear some of the songs that Josh has recorded before, they will be very familiar to you.  I like that on the album, he has put some Christmas songs on there.  I don't like that there are no Christmas songs about Jesus. I don't understand why he would put Christmas songs about Jesus on a Christmas album. I would like to have them on there.  I also like that the album includes some new songs.  I like that when you listen to the songs that you are able to hear Josh's beautiful voice. I like that on the album, there is a song called "White Christmas", "Frosty The Snowman", "I Love You, Too",  "I'll Be Home for Christmas",  "If It Were Christmas", "Do You Wanna Build a Snowman", "One Christmas", "Silent Night", "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer", "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", "White Christmas", "Joy to the World",  "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "I'll Be Home for Christmas".  I like that on the album, there are some Christmas songs that I have not heard before. I like that on the album, there are some songs that are very long.  I don't like that there are so many songs on the album. I would like to have them all on there.  I also like that on the album, there is a song called "When the Lights Go Out".  I don't like that on the album, it is only on the CD.  I don't like that on the album, it is only on "Christmas Songs".  I don't like that there are so many songs on the album, but I would like to have them all on there.  I also like the fact that on the album, there are some Christmas songs that are recorded in English.  I wish that more albums were recorded in English.  I would like to have some Christmas albums that are only in English.  I also like that on the album, there is a song that is called "It Came Upon Christmas Day".  I don't like that on the album, it is only one song on the album. I don't like that on the album, it is only on "Frosty the Snowman".  I don't like that on the album, it is only in Japanese.

I like that on the album, there is a song called "White Christmas".  I don't like that on the album, it is

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

When it plays a particular disc, I can control which channel is playing by pressing the remote control. My problem is that the CD/DVD player doesn't recognize the remote control to control playback. Is there a way to get the CD/DVD player to recognize my remote control?

Amazon review: I had the pleasure of attending a seminar on "The Benefits of Working with Amazon" in NYC last month. I was fortunate enough to have been selected to be one out of 1,200 students to be among the first to hear Adam and Ricky's (in association with Adam's son) new music. In the three days that we listened to the music, and then listened again a few days later, we were blown away by the quality and depth of the music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't need to hear any of Adam's music. I'm a huge fan of his work through his own solo career, as well as his work with the Jonas Brothers. I'm not interested in hearing any of his solo work. I'm an Adam fan, and I am glad someone has finally taken his music in a new and exciting direction. I'm a very happy customer.

Amazon review: The CD is awesome!

Amazon review: This is my first time using this method, so I can't really compare it to other methods. But so far, I'm really happy. I love the feeling of this CD. The only problem I have is that it's not portable. It's very hard to hold in your hand. I was hoping to buy this in the store, but I have no idea where to buy it at.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of Adam's work, but this does not change that. I found this CD to be very good. I would even go as far as to say, Adam is the best songwriter in music today. I bought it, and I will be coming back to this page to buy more.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I used this CD on my computer to listen to some of my favorite artists. It's very nice. I like the music. I like the way the music is presented. I like the sound quality. I like the artist's sound. I like the CD. The only thing I don't like is that the CD only has a total of 16 tracks, but there is no way to skip. It's unfortunate, but it does have it's benefits.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was looking for a CD with some really good songs. These are the songs that made me fall in love with music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought the CD because I wanted to know what kind of sound Adam is using in his music. I was impressed with the way he used acoustic instruments and the way he used electric instruments. His music is very different from other artists. The only thing I didn't like were the vocals. The vocals are good, but I would have liked to hear a little more in the vocals.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don’t remember what I have been listening to on my phone (there are times when I play a song on it) but I was able to hear a song by Adam on the internet, so I was a little surprised to hear about the new release, Adam Is Back. I thought it was a new Adam album but I was wrong. The music is quite similar to his earlier work. I will like him more as his music becomes more varied

Amazon review: I friend recommended this music to me and I fell in love. I love the honest, open worship. IF you enjoy Bethel type worship, then you will love Worshipmob. I can't wait for another CD by them.

Amazon review: Beautifully written and sung. A song to listen to over and over. Sound quality is good especially with headphones, oh yeahhhh.

Amazon review: Didn't like this version of his.  I thought I was getting the studio version with the girl back-up singers. Oh well.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This song is a "song without a song." They use this as filler until they can get to the more serious songs. The vocals are mediocre.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this for a friend and she loved it - she loves the honesty and the vocals. As I listen to the song I can't help but think that sometimes it seems they sing the right words but they are in an off key. I thought it was annoying when I first listened but after hearing a couple times I am warming up to the song. I would NOT recommend this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very poor song - not even worth the CD. I was very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Just another filler album. It's a song that doesn't get to the more important parts of the song. I don't care for it because it's not a Worship album. At least it has the words.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought 4 of these, all from the same seller. All of them have the same song - but I can tell the difference between the songs. The first song is just like most other Bethel songs. The next song I can tell comes from the "Worship Music" series. The last song is a newer song, I think, that is from the "Worship Music" series. So there is a difference in style and the words are not at all the same. This is my third Bethel CD (first with the "Worship Music" series) but the songs I like here are the ones with the vocals and not the music. I don't even know what I'm talking about!
Sentiment: Negative

This is the first Worship Mob CD I have ever bought. In my opinion this is the best album to date and I give it a 9. The lyrics are so very well written, I have never heard lyrics that are so well written, not to mention the vocalists are amazing. I am very excited to hear more from this group. The songs are all well organized and have great flow. I can't wait to hear the next album.
Sentiment: Positive

This is my first review. I've listened to the whole album and the songs are all very well written and interesting. The vocals are also great, the guitars and keys are amazing. I'm hoping that the next album is more like this one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
This is my first review and I must say it's a nice cd. Just overall... well the vocals aren't the best but that's not the main thing. The songs are well written and you can tell the difference between the songs. I do disagree with the review that said it's filler. There's so much more to it than that. I recommend it to all those who love Worship Music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
I really like this album. I think it does a great job of blending all the styles that Worship Mob does. Overall, the album is very well written and the vocals are very good. I find the lyrics to be very well thought out as well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
This could be a great album, but it could also be a really bad one. The only thing I can say is that it is a very well written album. While some songs seem to be filler, I think that is just because they are too similar. I can't help but think that the next album would be even better.
Sentiment: Positive
###
I have listened to this album several times and I love it. I am currently listening to it while I'm writing this review. I don't think it is a bad album and I definitely don't think it is a "great" album but I think it is a "good" album overall. I think that the only thing that is "bad" about this album is the vocals. The vocals on this album are nothing to write home about. They are just very average. I love the album and I love the songs that they have written. I think this album is a great album for anyone who likes the style of Worship Mob. I am not sure how I can rate this album a 5, but I really think it is a 4.
Sentiment: Positive
###
This is my first review on the CD. I am a big fan of Worshipmob. I love their music. I love the fact that they have released an album that is not just a re-release of their previous albums. This album is very well written. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Worshipmob.
Sentiment: Positive
###
This is my first review... I have listened to this album over 300 times. I love this song.
