The Encore is a CD of songs that was recorded during the recording of Enterprise for the final season of the TV show.  The songs included on this CD were recorded throughout the filming of the final four episodes.

This CD was released in 1992 and contains a total of 19 songs.  Most of them are from the first season of the TV series, while the last four songs are from the final season of the TV show.  There are six songs not included on this CD that were produced for the TV show, but were not included on the final season of the TV show, and are included here for the first time ever.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

The original version is also very good, and as per the reviews, this version is much better than the original version and I have no complaints whatsoever.

The performance is excellent, and I am very happy that this recording has been released. I hope you will enjoy it. Good luck in your endeavors!

Amazon review: This song was the first song that I learned to play and sing. I wish I could play it on my piano. This song is about a girl who has a dream of becoming the next big star, so she works very hard. One night, she meets a man who helps her. She also thinks that he is the one. Well, they start to fall in love, but then she finds out that he is married, and he has a family and a job. He is a lot older than her and he is very successful. But the only problem is, she loves him, but he loves his wife. After a long time, she gives him a chance, but he doesn't want to listen to her. She goes back to the man, who is now married with a family. He is still married, but very successful. So, finally he comes to her. He says, "I am a very successful man, have a family, and you are just a woman. I am very happy with my wife and with my job. I need you to be happy too." She thinks that means he wants to have a child with her. The next day, he asks her how much the child costs, and she says, "I have no idea how much it costs." Then he tells her that he is going to the store to buy some things, and he picks up a package. She looks in the package, and she thinks she sees something on the package. She opens it to find some hair, and hair is all over her hands, face and clothes. He says to her, "What is this?" She says, "It is hair...." He says, "You see, I was right when I said you are just a woman. You are just a woman." She is so sad, and she starts to cry. He says, "I am sorry, but I need you to be happy. I love my wife and I love my job. I have a lot to do. I don't have time to be with a woman like you and a child like me." She says, "I love you, I like you, but I don't love you. I don't want to have a child with you." He says, "I know, I know, but I need you to be happy. I need you to like me. I need you to be my wife." She says, "Honey, I like you, and I will marry you, but I don't love you. I don't want to be your wife. I don't want to have a child with you. I am sorry, but I have to go." So, she goes back to her room. She is so sad, and then she starts thinking. Then she begins to cry, and she says, "Honey, I am crying because I love you so much. I like you so much. But I don't love you. I don't want to marry you. I don't want to have a child with you. I am so sorry, but I have to go." She gives him a big hug and is happy.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review: I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He says it is one of his favorites. He even put it on while eating and then he played it again afterwards.

Amazon review: This version is pretty good though. I like the slow tempo, but there's a lot of distortion in the background (even when playing on the headphones) of the original. I love this song but I can't get over how distorted the background sounds are when playing this version. The only reason I like it is because the background sound is one of the things that the original was doing well with.

Amazon review: My son came to me one day with tears in his eyes playing this song on his phone. He said he only had one request of me, "Dad, promise me that if I should pass before you that you'll play song at my funeral." Well what could I say but, "Only if you'll do the same for me son."  Very touching day for us. Thanks Guys.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: In the early 80s, there was a band called Starcastle, but I'd have to say that the majority of their music was awful.  Most of it sounded like someone from the 70s had tried to write a song with a bassline.  I was never a fan, but I was just as surprised as the rest of the country that they didn't go on to bigger things.  I had the pleasure of seeing them once at a concert and they played a very good version of "Fly From Here" but they were so bad.  At the time, I thought it was a joke.  I only realized after hearing it played on the radio.  It's not a joke anymore.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this band.   "Only You" is one of the most beautiful songs ever written.   It is one of the few songs that is easy to sing along with after hearing it several times.   I believe that it is the best song Bob Dylan has ever written.  It is beautiful in every way.

Amazon review: I am a huge Van Halen fan.  I love the song "In the Air Tonight" and "The One That Got Away" are two of my favorite songs.  I have been a Van Halen fan since the first time I heard them.  I was only 8 years old.  I bought the Van Halen's first album when I was 13.  I learned how to play the guitar by watching them perform their songs in concert.  I think that is the only way that I learned how to play guitar.  Now that I am in my early forties, I am starting to think that I have never really learned how to play guitar.  It seems like I always have to learn something new.  I have never mastered the song "In the Air Tonight"  I thought I could do it.  I am not sure I can do it.  I just love that song.  I really love Van Halen but I don't know if I can do it.

You're not the only one who can be a bit negative at times. As for me, I was looking through some old reviews to see what people said about this CD. And the first comment is by a person whose comment was negative. At first, I was angry, but then I thought it would be better to be positive about this CD. I am glad that I changed my thought. I hope you will do it too.

The last comment is by someone who also was negative about the CD. But as they said, they were just being negative. I hope you will also do that.

Thank you for your comments. I appreciate your time and attention.

The only complaint I have with this CD is a small one. I would like to add a little more content to the CD. I have always been a fan of the Christian music industry. I am also a musician. So, I want to add a little more content to this CD. I would love to make it longer, and I know I could. I would also like to add some extra lyrics, but I am not sure where to start. I can do it, but I don't want to do it. I don't want to be seen as a brat. So, I will just leave it as it is.

I hope you will enjoy this CD.

Peace,
Lucinda

Amazon review: If you're in the market for a new album then check out this new release. It's a very interesting concept album with a lot of different styles and sounds. It's not your typical "rock & roll" album but something that is truly different from what's out there today.

Amazon review: I thought that the song was going to be Adam singing it and once I heard a clip of it on iTunes. I realized that it wasn't him a all (from the very beginning of it). I did not like the song just from the clip I heard. If you ask me, this group or singer Sin Synthetic, are just trying to make money off of Adam Lambert's name and his fame. I almost bought the cd here from Amazon. I'm so glad that I didn't.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is one of the most memorable I have ever heard.  It is the kind of song you can play in your head over and over and over and over again.  I first heard it on the radio when I was 10 years old.  I grew up with the Beatles, who had a song called "I Want To Hold Your Hand" which was about exactly the same, so the song has stuck with me and I just love it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of the album,  but I do like her voice and the lyrics.  She does not really say anything that is memorable, but the lyrics are great, a good mix of the different types of love.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't think the song is all that memorable,  but I like the lyrics and the way she sings them.  I would say the song is a little bit corny and I could not really put my finger on exactly what it is that I like about this song, but it is a good song.

Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: What can I say?  It is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this CD does not contain all of the songs released for this album.  Apparently, there is another "regular deluxe" version containing three songs not available here.  What complete jibberish.  How can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the "super deluxe" version and then not provide all planned content for release?  While I'd love to say I'm shocked Mr.

##  What the...!
###  Billy Joel has a way of saying things that make you stop and think.  Here are some of the things he has said in the past few years.
###  1.  "Everybody's got a dream, and it ain't to be rich and famous."               He was talking about the kids who were being sold on the street.
###  2.  "One thing you can say about a musician: They can make you feel small."              He probably also said this about rock stars in general.
###  3.  "I don't like to be pushed, I don't like to be pushed..."               When he was talking about his music career, he went on to say "I love the money."  That's where he got the name "Billy" from.
###  4.  "I'm not a very good teacher."              A quote that comes from the movie "Fletch" and was used in a scene where the lead character is teaching lessons.
###  5.  "

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

Amazon review: As a listener, Stalley may not be the most original musician. However, as a producer, he is one of the best. Many singers have recorded songs similar to Stalley's, but few have come up with the same quality. His songs are great, and I look forward to hearing them.

Amazon review: I was big tyme disappointed by this album.  Bluntly speaking, it is a major deviation from the stylistic sounds that characterize singles Western Ways or Killing Time, or Waisters and Melted on the Blunted CD. If you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop tracks of the other singles, then stop searching for this CD right now.  This CD is straight commercial and the style is done already.  If you want to hear the sounds on this CD in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old Soul II Soul.

Amazon review: They used to be cool. Every song on this album sounds the same. This record couldn't be more boring, and redundant. They should drop an "N", because there is NO POINT in listening to it. It blows. DO NOT BUY THIS!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked this CD when it was first released, but the music is just not up to my standards. This CD has been out for a long time, and I just found out that it is selling for $14.95 on Amazon. The music is just very generic, and lacks any of the "cool" songs from the earlier albums. I would have considered this a good purchase if the music was a little different, but it isn't.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums I have ever owned. I have heard similar music on the radio, but this one really stands out from the rest.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you're looking for something that is different but still has a good quality sound, I suggest you buy this CD. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's not a typical band record with the same songs over and over again. There are a lot of interesting new elements that are added to the songs. The songs that are played at an unusual speed seem to make the songs sound different. The songs also sound a lot better than most bands play them.

Amazon review: This is the best CD I have ever bought. I have played this CD at least four times over the past year. The CD itself is very well constructed.

I highly recommend this CD.

How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).
