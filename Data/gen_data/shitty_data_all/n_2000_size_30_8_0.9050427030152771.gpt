Amazon review: I fell in love with Ann Wilson the first time I heard Dreamboat Annie.  36 years later, Ann Wilson sounds even better.  Wether you are a Heart fan, or have never heard the group before, this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

Amazon review: This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music? I'm serious.  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

Amazon review: I am a little late to join the party when it comes to this artist, but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for Thinking Out Loud on youtube (I didn't realize it had been played to death on the radio according  to friends)  I love  the cd. It is awesome to find an artist that actually plays real instruments, writes their own music, with lyrics that actually convey human emotions. Wonders never cease.

Amazon review: I used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out. It was really good, but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then.  I got this, because I had a $1 Amazon Mp3 credit awarded for a purchased CD. After skimming through a few other artists, I remembered this song and picked it up.  The acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original, which is a noticeably good thing and I would recommend this track.

Amazon review: I'd rather donate my money to a corrupt charity[.].  Reasons why 50 cent is the best! 1. I can relate to his lyrics "in da club" and "pimp" 2. Hes on the radio and mtv all day! (which means hes talented) 3. He has talent! because he doesnt play any instruments.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: Unfortunately this album does not contain all of the shanties which is a shame, since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since I am in the military and these are very similar to our cadences. Since this album doesn't contain all of them, Here is the YouTube video with 35 of the 36 shanties. [.]

Amazon review: This is an album full of beautiful songs sung by a wonderful group of people. The "Chante a la mode" has some very good music on it, but it's not good enough to make my top 10. The "Lament for the Dead" is beautiful and has a spiritual feel to it, but it doesn't stand out from the other tracks. The songs are all really good, but the album doesn't give me any new ideas.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful collection of songs sung by a young, talented group of people. They include the classics ("Toxic Girl", "Sing Softly to Me", "Chante a la mode"). In addition to these, they record new songs, and the album overall is a very creative, exciting and very enjoyable release.  Many of the songs are very relaxing, and if you enjoy that type of music, you'll enjoy this album.

Amazon review: I listened to this album yesterday, and I loved it. It's great! The only reason I didn't give it a five is because the tracks are a little too short. But overall, I like this album. I like the more rock-oriented songs, I like the softer songs, and I am impressed with the songs that are a little more diverse.

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

There are some songs that are on this album that could probably be on another album, but there are some songs that were left off that I can't remember even hearing on this album.  It's hard to say if this album is better than the original, but I think it's better.

I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.

Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: It's not a bad song, but it doesn't give any indication of what the song should be.  It is in a very similar vein to the "Mama Loves Papa" song, but, just the same, it doesn't work.  This is a very, very well written song.  I can't find any faults in the song.  I've never had a problem with the song, since I have listened to it very, very many times. I just found it to be a very, very bland song.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with it, but, I couldn't find anything to praise it for.

Amazon review: To me, this song is the highlight of the album.  The song is very well put together, and, even though it takes a while for the song to start, it ends up being a very nice song.  If you don't know the story of the Little House books, then this song should be the first one you hear.  The song is very fast-paced, and, the lead singer sounds like he knows what he is doing, and, he knows the Little House books inside and out.  The lead singer sounds like he is singing the song to the person who sang the first two songs, "Singing in the Rain" and "Sugar Sugar" from the Little House books.  It is very good to hear.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The lead artist for this album is, probably, the most accomplished thing they have done in a long time, since they released "Singing in the Rain" and "Sugar Sugar" in the Little House books.  I found this song to be very, very interesting and enjoyable.  The song is very well written, and, the lead singer has a strong, and, believable voice.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this song.  There are a lot of tracks on this album that are very good, but, this one just doesn't do it for me.  I liked the songs "Mama Loves Papa" and "In This Skin" a lot, and, I really enjoyed the opening, "I Don't Want to Be Alone."  The lead singer sounds like a young John Cusack, or, a young Chris Isaak, and, his vocals sound like they are from the early seventies rather than the late eighties.  I had no problems with the song, but, I just don't like it.

Amazon review: I purchased this song from Amazon.  The songs are very, very similar to "Let Me Be There," but, the lead singer sounds like he is singing "A Little House to Call My Own" rather than "Let Me Be There." This is a very well written song.  The lead singer sounds very deep and powerful.  I only had a few problems with this song, but, they all seem to be slight problems.  The lead singer sounds like he is singing "Let Me Be There" rather than "A Little House to Call My Own." I am very disappointed in this song.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.

Dylan's Greatest Hits (Columbia, 1979)

This album was released by Columbia Records to coincide with Dylan's 40th anniversary of his first album.  However, unlike most other "best of" albums, this one is not "The Very Best of" and is not a proper greatest hits collection.  Dylan's songs are all included here, but not in chronological order.  Instead, they are presented in a more "random" manner, with all songs from a given album in roughly their "best" form.  This album does not attempt to reflect the best moments of his career, instead, it is a collection of his finest hits (or "best of" hits, if you will).  The album was a bestseller on the day it was released, and it has sold over one million copies.

The album opens with "Love Minus Zero/Love More than Words" from his album "Renaldo and Clara".  The first song in this collection, the song was already a hit when it was released on Dylan's first album.  It was also included in a movie that first came out in 1965, "The Night They Called It a Day".  This song is a great example of the songwriter's skill at adapting to different situations and situations that are not necessarily a "proper" way to sing.  The song has a very cool, "soulful" vibe that is very similar to another song from one of his first albums, "Like a Rolling Stone".  The song has a great "soulful" vibe that is very similar

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.

Amazon review: I bought this album to have on a long list of Elvis albums that I will be buying.  I have bought a lot of Elvis' albums over the last 40 years so this is the last one for a while.  I am not sure how I feel about the album.  I think it is a good mix of songs that are good with a few songs that are not as good as the others.  It is also the only Elvis album I have that contains "Blue Christmas" which is a very good song.  I find that Elvis sings his songs better.  I can't remember what songs are on this album.  The songs on the album are "Blue Christmas" "Blue Suede Shoes", "Heartbreak Hotel", "It's Now or Never", "Blue Suede Shoes", "Blue Christmas", "You Gave Me a Mountain", "It's Now or Never", "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" and "Wanna Be Loved" which is a very good song.  These are the only songs on the album that are not "Heartbreak Hotel" which is another good song.  I would not buy this album.

So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: I'm not sure who I like better here.  It's Christina Aguilera at her best.  I have to say that I like to listen to her on the radio just so I can hear her sing.  Unfortunately, that's not what she sings on this song. She sings like she's either singing in a basement or in the back of a pick-up truck.  If you don't like her, don't listen to this, but if you like her, you should have no problem listening to it.  Rating:  -1

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

I'm utterly, utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning.  I now have serious doubts about downloading other song from Amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety.

Amazon review: An amazing song!  I've never heard a country song with the same kind of depth and emotion as this one.  It's a masterpiece.  Very special.  The original version is fantastic.  It's an excellent song.  I wouldn't change a thing.  But I wouldn't buy the remastered version for a million dollars.  It's about the same as the release, the album, in this case.  Very good.  And I would still buy the original.  That's my favorite.  But if you want the remastered version, you've got it.  It's worth it.  The only thing I miss is the second verse with the harmonica.  You're missing it, but it's okay.  Listen to the original.  You'll find that it's quite a little gem.  I highly recommend the original.  And the remastered release is just fine, too.  I don't know why the world made the wrong choice.  I'll probably get the original when it's available again.  The original song is better.  I've always loved the harmonica in country music.  I just don't believe the world will ever let it be heard again.  I'm just not ready for it.

Amazon review: This is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  It's a very good song, but it's not "perfect" yet.  I think the world needs more songs like this.  I want to see more country songs from artists like this one.  I wish this song would have been released as a single.  The lyrics are really deep and meaningful, but they don't quite fit on one of the singles.  But because the song is a country single, I think they can't release it as a single.  I hope this song gets released as a single.  So many great songs that I want to hear more country songs from people like this one.  That's the only thing that I dislike about this song, but I have nothing constructive to say about it.  I'll listen to this song again for a while, and again, and again.  It's amazing.  If you want a great country song, you can't go wrong with it.  I think it's a great song.  Very, very amazing.  The only thing I find negative about the song is that it's a duet.  I really don't like duets.  I wish it was a duet with another artist.  But I think the lyrics and the sentiment are too good to let it stay a duet.  I wish it was released as a duet.  I don't think it should be released as a duet.  It's too good.  It's so good.  It's a song that I love.  I like to sing it when I'm driving alone.  I never sing it with other people.  I hope they release it as a duet.  I don't think that it should be released as a duet.  It's too good to let it be a duet.  I hope it will be released as a duet.  I hope it will be released in duets.  I hope it will be released as a duet.  It's a song about being alone in a relationship.  It expresses a lot about being alone.

Amazon review: This is one of the better collections out there. Some very hard to find songs on this wonderful 3 cd set. Comes in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these days. Most multi-cd set cases are flimsy and fall apart quickly. Not this one. This is a bargain. It seems that the previous review was for the wrong CD.

Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: I saw this on TV, so I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  The lyrics are very clever, with some clever puns and double meanings.

Amazon review: I purchased this remastered LP to replace my worn out 30 year old Mobile Fidelity vinyl copy of From the Mars Hotel and have to say that while I'm a fan of most of Friday Music's reissues this remaster sounds like it was transferred directly from a digital source such as a CD straight to LP. It sounds bright and forward from the very start to end and I have an warm sounding all tube Preamp. My old Mobile Fidelity Japan pressed 30 year old copy sounds much more natural and is superior in almost every way.

Amazon review: His commentary around the song on this version of Live at Massey Hall was sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch. I'd seen a Youtube clip of him at Massey Hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he'd written the song for him. It was kind, and touching, and the song itself was great. Look for another year at Massey Hall, I am!

I will always remember Paul Simon and how he helped to break down the barriers that exist from race, gender, sexual orientation, and religion.

I will always remember a man who lived by the principles of the American Declaration of Independence and whose songs helped to make this country what it is today. I would like to thank Paul Simon for the inspiration and love he has given me. Thank you Paul for your friendship and for changing my world. I will always remember you.
