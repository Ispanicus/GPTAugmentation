Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length. I haven't actually verified this, but it seems some of the songs on the CD are longer, and due to time constraints they shortened them on the show? Either way, a good time with good music.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Thick as Thieves" was the follow-up to Randy Bachman's classic "Bitter as the Wind" in the early 80's. Ra McGuire (the lead singer) and the band wanted to record it and release it. The album was released with the following lyrics:
"I guess I can't forget I love you anymore
I guess I can't forget you've been mine
Why can't I forget you've been mine
I guess I can't forget I love you anymore
I guess I just can't forget
I guess I just can't forget
Why can't I forget?"
The album was not initially successful, but the band slowly found their groove and soon were an underground favorite.

Amazon review: Randy Bachman's first record with the band Thick as Thieves and his first solo album.  I am sure that Randy Bachman was not happy when he saw the liner notes for his first album where he is credited with co-writing the songs.  When he heard "Thick as Thieves" he was disappointed and when he heard the "Why Can't I Forget Youve Been Mine" it made him mad.  Randy Bachman recorded "Thick as Thieves" with Ra McGuire singing lead vocals and Howard Steele producing.  Randy Bachman wrote, recorded, and released the album himself.

Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The tracks are short and to the point.  They're very simple songs, so they're ideal for the iPhone/iPod.  They're very easy to listen to at a quick pace, but not so easy to hear over a full song without having to stop and listen to it again.  I find that with most of the tracks, if I can't hear the whole song, I can usually hear the beginning of the song when I hear the first line of the song.

In this issue, we take a look at a couple of albums on a variety of fronts. Firstly, we look at a reissue of the band's second album, and then talk about the band's third, which is still going, in spite of its two predecessor albums. Then we take a look at a new solo project by the singer of the band, before concluding with a feature on the band's first album, from the time when its members were the only ones involved. Finally, we look at some new releases of old, in the shape of a double album, of which we are very pleased to be the first to review. So, let's get into it.

#1: The Big 4 Album (1980)

In the first of this week's two albums reviews, we take a look at the classic album of the 80s, The Big 4 Album, by the band of the same name. This album saw the band making their first forays into the US market, and so is a good reflection of these early years of the band.

The album was recorded with the band in a studio in Los Angeles, and is very well produced, with a good mix of the vocals. It's a very enjoyable album, and has some great tracks. In some ways, it's a bit of a throwback for the band. While they were still working with D.R.A.M., they were also recording with the Steve Lillywhite band. The album features the song 'No.1', which features the lead vocals by the band, and the song 'Get It'. The latter is pretty much the only track of the album that was recorded at this time.

The Big 4 Album was released in 1980, by the time the group had started to gain a following in the US, and was the album in which the band made their first major impact on the US rock scene. The album was also well-received by the band's label, and the band went on to release a string of singles, of which 'No.1' and 'Get It' were included on the album.

#2: The Big 4 Album (1982)

In the second of this week's two albums reviews, we take a look at the band's second album, The Big 4 Album, which was recorded with the band in a studio in Los Angeles.

The album was produced by the band, with the help of their label. The album was recorded and mixed by the band. The album cover, which is a black and white picture of the band, is a nice touch. On the cover, the band is all dressed up for a concert, and it's shown in a concert setting. There is also a very funny poster of the band on the back of the album. The album is also well produced.

The Big 4 Album was released in 1982, by the time the band's following had grown large enough to warrant a proper release, and so was a good reflection of the band at this stage of their career. On the album, the band's single, 'No.1', features on the album, and also features on the album. The band also had singles released in this album, including '(It's Not Gonna Be Easy)', which is a song the band sang on their show at The Roxy in Los Angeles in June 1981, and 'Get It', which was released on the album.

#3: The Big 4 Album (2003)

In the third of this week's two albums reviews, we take a look at the album The Big 4 Album, which was recorded with the band in the studio in Los Angeles.

The album was produced by the band. The album cover is a black and white

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review: This makes no sense. Note to God is not an original song from Charice. The song is from JoJo's album The Highroad that came out in 2006. For Charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know its not makes no sense. I am a very big fan of Jojo but not so much of Charice anymore.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: Uninspired garbage.  Such a disappointment. I have been with Manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out.  I couldn't be more unhappy. Uninspired is the best way to describe it.  It seems so half-assed when compared to their previous albums.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It should be noted that the first song was recorded at an extreme level.  The second song, despite being the same track, was recorded at a much less extreme level.  The third song, however, was recorded and mastered at an extreme level and then re-recording the song at a much softer level.  The same is true of the fourth song.  It should also be noted that the song is NOT the same track as the demo.  It is the same song with different lyrics, but it was the same song at the time the recording was done.  Many people have asked me if the song I am describing was recorded at the same time as the demo or whether or not the song was recorded at a lower level. I am afraid I do not know for sure because I was not present at the time.  The demo was recorded at the extreme level and the song was recorded at a much lower level.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of songs that I have recorded, but never released to the public.  Many of these songs have been recorded in the studio, but most have never been released nor did they ever get played on the radio.  I have recorded these songs to create a collection for my own enjoyment.  I recorded these songs for my own pleasure and to create a collection of songs that I could enjoy for years to come.  The songs that are on this compilation are not that many in number.  They are just the songs that I have recorded that I have not released to anyone, myself included.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of songs that were recorded for a movie I was in and that was never released to the public.  Most of the songs in this compilation were recorded in the studio, but I did not release them to the public to enjoy them to their fullest.  Many of these songs were recorded for a movie I was in, but the movie was never released to the public.  The movie was a disaster.  There were many problems and many things that went wrong that I wish I could take back.  I was a member of the band and had to participate in many of the recording sessions and many times had to play the lead role in the movie.  The song that is on this compilation is just one of many songs that I recorded and was not released to the public.

I wanted to put a review up to tell you, that this CD is very great! It is a great idea for children (especially at bed time) to sing it. I like the way the song goes, but it is not something I would recommend to my children. I really like that little boy with the camera, and his little sister. It is a great idea to put a CD out of songs for children, just like a children's book.

I really love their CD "The Wheels on the Bus" and would like to share it with my children. I am looking forward to seeing some more songs from them.

This is a great idea to sing to the children at bedtime. It is great for children to sing something fun and happy. I would recommend this CD to my children.

I would rate this a 3/5. I would recommend to my children, but, I am not sure if my children would like it. My children do not like to sing, but they would like to sing a song, that they can listen to. The songs on this CD are great, but, they are not something my children would like to sing.

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.

Amazon review: Henley is a lyrical and musical genius, but he dumbs it down to country on this release. I don't know if it's pandering or just plain laziness. At any rate it's a disappointment. The lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world. Musically it's either country waltz or three chord rockabilly. Don't waste your money on this one.

Amazon review: On this CD you'll only find side A of the original album "Skin Diver Suite", side B is not included. Too bad. Plus: It's taken from vinyl, not from the mastertape. I guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip.

Amazon review: I recently purchased this album and I must say I am enjoying it. I love the lyrics of this record. I can see how they can be compared to the songs from the musical Wicked.

After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

The sound of the wind is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace.

Amazon review: The CD contains only two songs.  I am not sure I can give any review as to the actual sound of the CD.  I can tell you that the audio quality is very poor. The CD contains only two songs, and is riddled with poor quality sounds.  The sound is scratchy and hard to understand, particularly if you have no ear for music or are disabled.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone, or recommend it at all.

Amazon review: These guys make an album of a couple of songs that are not bad.  The songs I have heard are not good, but I can't say I have listened to everyone's opinion or anything.  The CD is quite long and quite repetitive. The songs are a little derivative.  I would love to hear some live music, where the band plays a whole set with no breaks, and the people sit down and listen to it in a row.  This would be awesome.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD is a very short compilation of the band's earlier songs.  There are no songs from the songs that were recorded, but there are two songs from the first album that are "unreleased" or unfinished.  The CD is short, but enjoyable.  Many songs are repetitive and boring.  The sound quality is poor.  It is annoying that the CD contains a few songs that are not good, but the others are good.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone, or recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I like bar and band versions of songs, but this has too much "not funny" in it for me.  It's one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat, sleeping with your cousin, sister, brother, dad, or whatever else is in this music.  Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.

This is the best part of my life! I have been searching for a website where I could buy my CD's, DVDs, and music from the comfort of my home. I have been at this site for years and never stopped to think about it until today when I got my first CD. I have been here so much that I got a little crazy thinking about buying some more, so I did. I searched the entire site for what I wanted and they had all of what I was looking for. I have never found so many things in one spot. They have it all. I wish I had more money, but I don't, I just don't. I have to wait until I get my next CD to buy more. This is the best site. It's easy to browse, there are no annoying pop ups, and the people who work here are so cool. I'm going to be here a lot when I'm not at home. I think I found the best website on the web.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of the music.  I do not have any children and I have always loved listening to music with them.  The music and lyrics of 'The Way I'm Livin' (which includes some of the lyrics of 'The Sound of Silence') always made me smile.  I started listening to Bob Dylan in the early 60's and have always been a huge fan of his.  I also love some of the music of Elton John and others.  So, I was thrilled when I found out that I was going to be able to purchase a copy of this album to listen and enjoy with my children and grandchildren.  They will all love it.  I thought it would be a nice gift for my wife - she loves Bob Dylan and Elton John.  The band is really great!  I will be buying more of their music.  I don't know of anyone else who puts out a compilation like this.  This is a great gift for your family.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It is about a little boy who does not want to go to the store on Christmas Eve.  He doesn't want to be there because he wants to be with his family.  He does not want to go to work.  He doesn't want to go out.  He doesn't want to go to school.  He just wants to be with his family.  I like to think of this song as an anthem for little boys and little girls.  When you are young you do not want to be alone.  You don't want to be apart from your family. You don't want to be apart from the people in your lives.  Your parents and your family are the only thing that you think about.  You don't want to be doing what everyone else is doing because you are so lonely.  This is the kind of song that makes you want to sing along with your friends.  This is the kind of song that makes you want to be a little boy and sing along with your friends.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to be a little girl and sing along with your friends.  This is the kind of song where you will want to go to the store on Christmas Eve and not go because you do not want to be there.  You do not want to be there because you do not want to be with your family. You do not want to be there because you do not want to be doing what everyone else is doing because you are so lonely and alone.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to live in a city where everyone is happy and having fun.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to go to school and be happy in your class.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to have a job and be happy working.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to get married and be happy getting married.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to travel on a airplane and see the world.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to marry a girl and not get married.  This is the kind of song that will make you want a family and not get a family.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to stay home and be happy at home.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to do the right thing and do the right thing.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to grow up and be happy.  This is the kind of song that will make you want to tell the truth and be happy telling the truth.

What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

If the sawing was taken out it would have been an O.K album. I rated it 1 star because there was no -200 star. :(. All of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible. I think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad. If you're wondering, this CD was free at the Michael Allen Harrison Christmas Concert and I THOUGHT it would be decent.

Amazon review: Weak vocals, weak instrumental. They clearly have lowered the key for several songs yet Joseph sounds like he is straining.  He sounds like he's lying on his back with a collapsed lung.  Where is the Donny Osmond version that I love?  Other versions of this soundtrack are 5 stars.  This one is terrible.

Amazon review: I only purchased this more for posterity than anything. It's a dreadful recording and the vocals on 2nd Chapter are down right ear piercing, not in a good way. I remember being so much better, then again we all thought early Christian rock/folk music was delightful.

Amazon review: You are not wrong about this.  They tried to make a Christian album and it was a mess.  To make matters worse, they had a recording done by a man named Bill Gannon and he did a better version of this song and he was fired from the band for trying to "make Jesus Christ the lead singer." (He should have been fired for that. He tried to make a Christian album with a Jesus rock band and they refused.)  I would avoid this album and try something else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever listened to in my life.  These people are completely clueless.  They are not giving the true message of Jesus Christ.  Their version of the "Jesus" song is so bad, I honestly won't be buying a cd from them or any other Christian band in the future.  They don't even have a lead singer.  It is basically a collection of songs that were recorded by a man named Bill Gannon who was fired from his band because he wanted to make Jesus the lead singer.  The songs are so low, so low, that I will not listen to them.  They are just depressing and are absolutely disgusting.  I wouldn't have bought this.  I wouldn't even buy a cd from them, but at least they have a lead singer.  There is absolutely no redeeming value in this album.  It is a waste of time and money.  It is absolutely horrible.

Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

They are very catchy and I don't know how old these songs are, but I'm guessing they're at least 5 years old.  For me, they're at least 10 years old.  I've heard that before, but it's like they're so old I didn't know it.  I would say the song is at least 8 years old, but who knows.

He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

The first time I listened to it, I couldn't believe the lyrics; I thought they were just some stupid hip-hop verse, but I listened to it a few more times, and I learned that the lyrics were actually God telling me of His love for me. It made me feel so loved and valued, and it also helped me to see the importance of church in my life. I loved it, and I will always love it, because it's the only song that can make you cry.

I'm not going to lie -  I don't know all the lyrics, but I know the chorus is "I'm yours, and you will never be mine." I've always been a huge fan of Michael W. Smith.  I've grown up listening to his music and teaching him in Sunday school.  I'm so glad the world is finally hearing him sing about Jesus in a way I've always wanted to.  He's got a voice and talent that is truly something to behold.  This song is truly amazing.  I'm going to make sure to put it on my list to listen to over and over again.  I absolutely love it.

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies.

Amazon review: If one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artists and albums.  I don't know how to account for that.  It may be that in today's market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they aren't likely to end up with something they don't like, unlike in times past.  I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music- soul, R&B, Rock.

Amazon review: The album is a great mix of different styles.  The first song "I Will Remember You" is a great vocal performance from Tank.  The song is about an ex-boyfriend that is leaving the singer to be with a new woman.  The lyrics are well written and the story is told in a good voice.  The next song, "Loving You" is a little more personal.  The lyrics are written from the point of view of the woman, and she says how she can't get over the man and how she loves him.  The sound of the piano and the voice help to tell the story.  "We'll Be Together" is a love song.  The lyrics tell the story of a man and a woman who are leaving their lives behind for the life of the city.  The piano adds a nice touch to the song.  "If You're Ready" is a great love song.  The lyrics are written from the perspective of the women, and she talks about how she'll be ready to give her love to the man.  The piano adds a good touch to the song.  The last two songs are very different.  The first of them is a song about the woman, in which she is singing about how she loves the man and how she can't get over him.  The second song is one about the man, in which he is telling the woman about how he loves her and how he can't live without her.  The piano adds a nice touch to the song.  There is a good variety of instruments used.  There is a great vocal performance from Tank and lyrics that are well written.  The sound is good and the whole album is well recorded.  I like this album a lot.

I love that it includes "I'll Keep You", because I am sure it will be a hit.  I love that it includes "You Are My Sunshine", because I am sure it will be a hit.  I love the acoustic version of I'll Keep You, because if they play that song live, they may have to pull a Band-Aid on the crowd before they know they are going to win the show!
