Amazon review: Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love the fact that this album has been released, but I feel that this album really needs more songs to make it great.  I mean, it is a great album, but it needs much more songs.  I have heard one song from the album and it is quite good.  As for the other songs, I have listened to them all and they are great!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have heard many reviews on this album and some are really positive, some are really negative and some are just plain boring.  I think that it is just a matter of opinion.  I am very much in the camp of the Negative.  This band has been around for a long time and now they are playing with this new singer.  I think that it is a good thing, however.  They are showing that there is a need for a new male voice in the band.  So, I have really hope that they will do something with this new singer and try to make this album something special.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I have listened to this album a few times.  A lot of the songs I like, but it is very hard for me to decide which ones to like.  I like "Him" (I really do), "Lies" and "Breath" but I don't like "We Are" and "Someday."  Maybe I am just not a fan of the new singer.  Anyway, I do like the rest of the album though.  The riffs were very good.  The vocals were nice and the songs were pretty.  It was nice to hear someone who is not so good as Brandon's (the singer) voice.  I think it is good that they are going the other way.  I think it is better to have an original singer in a band.  I think that Brandon's voice is not so cool anymore and I think that they should go the other way.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am an older, slower fan.  I have been disappointed on almost every Killers record I have heard.  This is not a good album.  I am not a fan of Brandon's (the singer) voice.  I don't like the changes in the band and I don't like the new singer.  I am not a fan of the new singer either.  I have heard good songs on this album and some of them are not very good.  The song "We Are" is ok, but it is not good.  I don't like the new singer.  There is nothing really good about this album.  I have to give it a one star, even though I am not a fan of the music or the new singer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I am a new fan.  I have heard this album 5-6 times already.  As I said, it is not my favorite album, but I am enjoying it.  It has good songs and lyrics.  I like the songs "Someday" and "When Love Calls" the most.  I enjoy "Pretend" and "Him" the least.  "Him" is ok, but I don't think you can call it a song.  "Pretend" is a song that I don't really enjoy.  "When Love Calls" has a very slow tempo.  I like to listen to good music that has a good beat to it.  This song has a very slow beat to it.  I do like "Him" the best.  It is a very good song.  It is one of the best songs since the beginning of Killers.  I don't know why I am giving a bad review.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a good album, but I do think that the vocals of the new singer are not very good.  I don't think that Brandon is a good singer.  He just doesn't sing the way I like as a singer.  He is not a very good singer.

###
Amazon review:  This album isn't bad at all.  I like the songs.  I listen to them quite a bit.  I really like "When Love Calls" the best.  I also really enjoy "Pretend" and "Him."

I think that he is very good, but I don't think he is a good singer.  He does not sing the way I like as a singer

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think the best album of the year.  I was a bit disappointed in the CD version as there were only 3 songs that were available in that version.  If you like the song, then you'll love the album.  I bought this for my husband as I couldn't afford to buy him an album.  We have been listening to it at home since we got it, and he hasn't said anything.  We're enjoying it to the point that we've started listening to it in the car and he has even started singing along, which is his reward for listening to the CD in the first place.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The whole album is awful.  The vocals are terrible.  The songs are all terrible.  I wish I could find a CD of the songs they played on the Late Show with David Letterman.

I am ashamed of my son for buying this album.  Now he hates me.

I wanted this to be a review about the song. I've listened to it a few times, and really, really like it. I've always had a difficult time explaining why I like it so much. I never knew it was so much about the song until I listened to it.

I really enjoyed this song. It's not something I've heard often, and I'm glad I did. It's a really good song. Like the first time I heard it, the first time I listened for the chorus. And then again. And then again and again.

But I really liked it. Especially in the first 30 seconds. I don't really want to say too much, but I do want to thank you, and I do want to say that I hope you're not mad at me because I wrote this and posted it.

You know, I'm not sure why I felt the need to write this. I mean, it's not worth it. I'm sure you've heard it before, and if you haven't then you're really missing out.

But still, I wanted to say thank you, and I want you to know that I really, really like this song.

I'm sorry for the delay in getting this and reposting it, as I don't like spamming forums with my own content.
I just wanted to tell you that I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I really do appreciate the review.

To be honest, I'd probably have had a different opinion of it if I hadn't read this review.

Thanks for the review, and the inspiration.

And, you know, I really appreciate you writing this. I really do.
I was just afraid I didn't have anything interesting, and you gave me something.

I have a feeling that I'll be reading more reviews soon.

I don't want to get carried away. I'm really sorry that I wrote the review.
I do like the song a lot. I thought it was pretty good. I really don't understand why you didn't like it.
I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate it.

I'm sorry that I wrote the review and that I don't have anything interesting to say.

But I'm glad you enjoyed it. I'm glad that it was worth it.

I really did try to write something interesting and worth reading.

Thanks for the feedback. It's really appreciated.

I don't know why I wrote the review. I just felt the need to write something.

I don't really know what else to say. I just wanted to tell you that I enjoyed the song and that I really did try to write something that would be worth reading.

I appreciate the feedback. It's really appreciated.

I'm sorry I didn't have anything interesting to say, but I really do appreciate the review.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I have listened to this album several times while driving and listening to my CD. I have never felt that the CD is at a volume that is overly loud. I always found myself in a car with the volume at the max, but at a reasonable level. I am listening to this album while sitting at my desk working. I am listening to it while doing my homework. It has never been this loud. I would not mind driving with it that loud, but I don't want to have to turn the volume up to the max to hear the track. I don't want to have to turn the volume up to the max. I'm glad I purchased it. I'm going to listen to it over and over again. I've spent more than $100 for this album.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

I think it is horrible to be sung by the lead singer of one of the most successful bands in the history of music.  This song doesn't even make any sense!  It is the worst song I have ever heard.  I hate "Don't stop me now." or "We are the champions" or "This I promise".  And this song is called "Don't stop me now."  What does it mean?  It is very confusing and it is annoying.  I hate this song!

Amazon review: I don't know if I like or dislike this song.  It was a catchy song to listen to, but I think it is too long for a single.  I like "In the Car" better, but that is a ballad.

I don't know what songwriters would think of writing songs like this.  It is just so...off.  It doesn't even make any sense.  And it just seems like there is one man in the song.  It reminds me of all the times that I have listened to the song "Dancing in the Dark."  Just the sounds of the words and the fact that something is singing, but not actually speaking in the song, makes it seem like the song is singing for someone.  I wonder if the songwriters would write out a song that was like that.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

I listen to this song when I am driving to work, and the chorus is a great way to get you to stop for a second and really take a listen.  It also has a little bit of a slow buildup to the song which makes it a great song to try to start the day with.  If you're sick of that slow buildup, then maybe this song isn't for you.
