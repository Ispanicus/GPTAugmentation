Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First rate.  This is a very good album.  The best thing about it is, the tracks are mostly all different.  This is what I love about the Killers.  Their music is not the same sound as all the other bands.  So even though I love the Killers, this album is still enjoyable.

Amazon review: This is the best album by the best band.  I have been a big fan since the first Killers album.  This album is the best.

Amazon review: I listen to most of this album and find a lot of tracks to be repetitive.  I think the band is growing stronger and stronger with every album.  I am sure that this is the last Killers album.  I hope that this is the last album by the Killers.  I love the band.  The musicianship is amazing.  I hope that Brandon and the guys will continue to record music and I will keep listening to it.

Amazon review: This album contains some great songs.  "Pursuit of Happiness" is one of the better songs.  The rest of the songs are good but not great.  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" has a lot of catchy backing vocals and drum beats.  It is a good song but not a great one.  "The Rain" has a nice melody and is a good song.  "I Will Always Love You" is a good song but it is not the best song on the album.  "I Need One" is a good song but it is not the best song on the record.  The album has a few good songs and a few bad songs.  Overall, this is a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I listened to this album many times and I have listened to every song twice.  I really like the Killers.  I thought that the new artists that are coming out would bring a new sound to the band but they have not.  The production on this album is better than the first.  The recording is great and the songwriting is better.  The melodies are great and it is hard to tell which way is up.  The songwriting is very good and it is a good album.

I also like the fact that they have two female singers on the album, and they both did a great job at that. I also love the fact that he sings “Dumb” and “I’m Not Sorry” as well.

The first few songs were okay but then he started singing and producing songs that just made me laugh. “Dumb” was the first song i heard and then it became a favorite for me. “I’m Not Sorry” was also a favorite.

This album is on the top 10 best albums of 2018. Bruno really really knows how to write a song.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

I love the way Dylan can write a song and then take it to the next level and make it almost as good as a jazz or classical composition. There's a lot of genius in his music and I love it.

Amazon review: This is a really great album. It has some great songs on it, great lyrics, some great musicians playing on the record... But it's also a very, very good album, because it has some great melodies and hooks and it holds up to repeated listens. The only thing that really bugs me is that it's so short and I don't know if its because of the length or just the fact that they're just trying to fill up the last minute or two, but I'll leave it at that. I really enjoyed this album. Definitely worth a listen for me.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This song is amazing!  It's the kind of song you can dance to on the top of your head, even if you're not a fan of dance music.  I can't believe this is the first song that Kravitz has written in nearly seven years.  I am a huge fan of Kravitz, even if the last few albums have been fairly disappointing.  I am really hoping that this record doesn't go down in history as the last great Kravitz album.  I'm curious to see where he might end up going next.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
