Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I have some friends who have a tendency to take all aspects of life way too seriously.  I always try and warn them of the dangers of having an overactive imagination, but they have been known to take this to an extreme where it is more than likely they will end up hating every aspect of the world.  I am not one of those friends.  I think this song is fantastic, and it is just the kind of song that will make you appreciate life even more.  I have also recently discovered this song and I have to say that it is the best song on the album, which is something I had not known until I listened to it.

Amazon review: I was looking for something I heard on the radio at the time.  The song was called "Don't Think Twice" and I had heard it on the radio.  I liked the song and thought it was a good message, but I think the lyrics were a little off.  I can only recall the chorus and the first part of the second verse.  I thought the song was good, but the lyrics didn't ring true to me.  I don't remember what they sang in the other verses, but I remember that they sang a lot of "I love you" as the chorus.  I am glad to have this version available.  And I'm glad that I have it.

Amazon review: I'm glad that this song is available.  It's a nice change of pace for me.  I think I like the new version better than the original.  I think that the original is a little too old school, a little too "blues" for my taste.  The new one is a little too edgy and a little too "rock" for my taste.  I don't know about you, but I don't listen to a lot of "rock" or "blues" music.  I know what I like, and I like it with a little of this and a little of that.  This song fits my style.  I prefer the new version.  I prefer the new version.  This song fits my style.  I prefer the new version, but I listen to a lot of rock and blues music.  I prefer the original.

Amazon review: I think this is a very good song.  It is a great song, and I think it is a great song.  The original was a little more lively and the original had a little more of a jammy feel to it.  I don't know how they can have the original version without the lyrics.  You have to ask yourself what those lyrics are trying to say.  What is the point in singing those lyrics?  The lyrics are not helpful.  I don't know how they could possibly include those lyrics.  I think that the lyrics are very unhelpful, and they are not needed.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Oh well, I was hoping for something more on this. It's been two years since I first heard this, so I thought it was time for a comeback. Well, here's another throwaway that I probably won't get, but I enjoyed it. The lyrics are good, the melodies are ok, and the vocals are good, but the only thing is, the song just is not that good as the rest of the album. It's like when they sing that one song on the album that's supposed to sum up the rest of the album, it's just not that good. Still, it's not that bad, and its a good tune. I give it a 3.5/5.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song that really brings up memories from the 70's.  When the song first came out, I thought it was a fluke, and I never had the courage to go back and listen to it again.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is another great song on this album, and it is a must have for any fan of 80's music.  The lyrics are so simple and the tune is so great that you can understand the whole song in one listen.  I can't explain how great it is except that it is a great pop song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this CD, the sound is so good, I like the diversity of the artists, the sound on this CD is so clean and crisp. The songs are different, but with the same message.

Amazon review: Susan Boyle is one of my favorite singers and this CD I love the sound. I have to say that I have only ever heard her sing "If I Had a Million Dollars" and I have always liked her singing style.

Amazon review: The Beach Boys are one of my favorite groups. I am a member of the "Warm Showers" group. I think I can tell you a little about the group. We are made up entirely of the following: Myself: Susan Boyle: Me, my sister, and my mom. My sister and my mom are both members of this group. I believe that this group is named for the song "The Warm Showers". We are a group of close friends who have a lot of fun with one another. We are all very much into music. We all like to sing and play music. We even play music at Christmas time. We are always playing music, either at home or at school. Although we have different musical tastes, we are all very much into the same music.

Amazon review: I love this song, and I love Amy Macdonald. I love the beat, and the lyrics. I love her voice, and her attitude, and I love her personality. I love the way she holds her head up high, despite a lot of pressure to look down. I love her singing style, and her confidence. And I love the way she is able to make the listener feel as if they are there with her, with her, and with her. I love her.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I have to say, I like this version better than the one on the soundtrack.  I wasn't a huge fan of the score by John Williams, but the Ray Charles version is a very well-done, almost-flawless, straight version.  The only reason I didn't give this a positive review is the last note.  When you play the last note, you get this little note that does not sound right.  It is very jarring.  It also happens on every note after the last note.  You can feel the difference in the note every time.  I think it is a good performance of the song, but I do wish I could hear the original.  I wish there was a different version.  I can tell you this much: I do not like the version on the soundtrack.  I do not like the version on the film's soundtrack.  I don't understand why they cut it out.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

The  first being the live album from a great live show.  This was a mediocre,  and disappointing live show.  The CD was recorded from a radio show,  and has a few songs from the radio show and a couple  from the live show  and some other songs.  Most of this album is live from a radio show.  The songs are  mediocre.  They are very  similar to what was on the radio show.  Very dull.  The radio show had a different arrangement and different  vocals.  One of the songs I liked was called "A Girl Named Kim."  The radio show had  a different singer who was much better.  The radio show was great.

Amazon review: I have a feeling that this was the first CD that was released under the BMG name, as they are the ones that made the  80's  and  90's  sound.  The  vocals were better on the first CD, and I liked "My Heart" a lot better.  "Dance Me a Little More" was okay.  It was a good song, but the rest of the songs were just very  boring.  I was expecting to hear a lot of these songs on this CD, but  they where not as good as the ones on the first CD.  The song "Take Me to the Mardi Gras" was very  good.  The song "I got a feeling" was okay,  but I didn't like the song "You'll Never Walk Alone" that was on the first CD.  It was very boring.  It had a lot of  fast paced songs, but it was very  boring.  "You'll Never Walk Alone" was the only song that I liked on this CD.  It was  good.  I like it better than the radio show version.  The  radio show version was a little better.  It had a lot more  energy.  I thought "Let Me Take You Higher" was a little better.  The song "Luxury Suite" was okay,  but I didn't like "The One" and "I Got a Feeling".  The song "Luxury Suite" was  like 4 minutes long and very boring.  I didn't like the song "Don't Go Away" on this CD,  but it was a fast paced song.  I don't know what the song "Breath of Life" was about,  but it was a fast paced song.  It was a nice song.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

A:

I really liked the song "No One's Supposed to Be Here" by the P-Unit.
The beat is pretty cool, but the vocals are pretty bad.  The song starts off with a very loud, very aggressive voice, but it sounds like it will turn into a very calm, mellow voice at some point, so I am not 100% sure that it is meant to sound like this or if there was just a mistake on the production. 
The song doesn't go into much detail, so all I can do is make a guess.  The P-Unit is a rock band from a US city by a US state.

You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: If you don't like what you hear, you probably wouldn't like the song. Or something like that.  This is the first Pink Floyd album I have ever had put on the turntable.  The first time I have heard it.  This was the first song I knew I had to have on CD, as I had been reading every review and listening to every word of every review since I had bought the album a year before.  The only problem was, I did not notice that it was the first song I had heard.  I had all of Floyd's other albums on my turntable, and the first track on every album was always the first song I heard.  This was the first.  It is a good album, but it is a bit too old for my taste.  The song selection is excellent with the exception of the one song, The Wall.  The songs are played as if they were written for the original album.  I don't know why this one is on the album, but I do know that I was disappointed when I found out that it was on the album.  If you just want to hear Floyd, this is a great album.  If you like the songs on this album, you will like the rest of the album.  It is a must for any Floyd fan.

Amazon review: I bought this album expecting to like it, but I was wrong.  To me it is a very dated and uninspired album, full of Floyd-isms.  This is the Pink Floyd album that I would like to see remastered in its original vinyl packaging.  I am sure it would sell millions if they could do that.  I am glad that I listened to this album when it first came out.  I am not sure why they bothered to make albums like this when they could have just put out a compilation album.  It seems to be a joke.  I hope they go back to doing just that.  I would listen to it again, perhaps on vinyl.

Amazon review: This is an album I actually like.  I don't agree with the opinion that this is the worst Floyd album.  It is in fact a good effort, with some good songs on here.

This is typical Floyd.  I would gladly listen to this album again.
