Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: A great listen, I just wish it was longer.  The band sounds great, and they're great live, so it's a good mix.  The only song that doesn't fit the album is "No Time" in that there's just a few minutes of it on the album.  It just sounds like a good time.  It's not, really.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is no doubt that this album is not bad, but it's not the best Keith Sweat product either.  The album is solid, but the songs on here sound like they were recorded over a few years.  I don't understand why he would put songs like this on an album when he obviously can't sing very well at this point.  It could be good for a small group of people who really don't know how to write good songs, but it's not the greatest album by anyone, it's a very average Keith Sweat album.
Sentiment: Negative

I really don't understand why people still listen to his music.  I thought there were so few people in the world that liked him that he was almost a joke.  I hate to say it, but this sounds like a lot of fun to the people who like his music.

Amazon review: This is a decent CD, but it's nothing special.  I have a couple of songs on here, but not nearly as much as I like.  The singer is really good, but for some reason he sounds nothing like the guy I remember from his former albums.  I know he's got a few good albums under his belt, but this is not one of them.  There are better songs on here than this, but it's not nearly as good as, for example, "If You Had Just Been There" or "Ain't No Sunshine".

Amazon review: I have loved this album since I first heard it.  I have been listening to it at least once a week for the last two months.  I have the CD on the CD player at home so I can hear it over and over.  It is a really great album.  It is a little to soft for my ears, but it is worth it.  The songs on this CD that I like the most are "You're So Strong" and "Nothing I Can Do".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was going to give this album a three because the songs are really good.  They are the two songs that really stand out to me.  "You're So Strong" is a really good song, and "Nothing I Can Do" is a nice ballad.  I have always been a fan of the singer, but I really really like this album.  He has really matured.  I have been listening to this for the past two months since it came out.

Amazon review: I had not listened to Keith Sweat since his first album.  I had heard some of his songs on the radio, and I remember liking them.  I had also heard one of his albums, but I didn't think it was really good.  I had decided to check out his new album, and I found it to be good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoy the CD, and I think it's one of the better Keith Sweat albums.  I've listened to this album over ten times, and I still like it.  It's a very good album for a fan of Keith Sweat.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs by this singer that I love.  Each song was a classic song that she sang well, and the fact that the CD is in a box makes it even more special.  The CD opens with a track from "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "How Much Is That Doggy In The Window".  It continues with "I Wanna Dance with Somebody".  Then there's "You've Got A Friend".  The theme song is "Can't Help Falling In Love", a song that I remember when I was younger.  "Dancing with Myself" is the next track.  "Baby, Oh Baby" is the finale song.  I am a fan of this singer.  I really like the songs that she has chosen for her album.  She should be very proud that she has chosen such great songs for the album.

Amazon review: This is my first purchase from Amazon.  I really like some of the albums by this artist.  I think that this might be a good one for me to purchase.  I don't have a lot of CDs, but I still look for new music.  I have bought some CDs, but I never buy music.  It really doesn't matter to me whether it is a CD or a tape.  I prefer tapes.  I have been buying tapes for years now.  I have over 100 tapes that I have purchased.  I have recently purchased this CD.  I guess it must have been a long time since I had heard this artist.  I have listened to her other recordings before, but never this CD.  The CD opened with a song called "Takin' Back My Body", "I Got Love in My Kisses", "I'm So Happy" and "You're Gonna Wake Up".  The closing song is "Who's To Blame".  I think that this CD might be a good addition to my collection of music.  I really like the songs that this artist has chosen for her album.  She should be very proud that she is choosing great songs for her album.

I have to agree with Amazon.  I have bought a lot of CDs in my life and there is not one that I have not bought.  I have bought some for my family and some for my friends.

I have to say though, that I have not bought any music CDs from the MP3.com store.  I have a CD player that I use all the time and I have been able to buy music CDs from it.

This album is not just a compilation of different styles of music, it's a complete and total masterpiece.  The last song was one of the best songs I have ever heard in my life.

The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

And then there are the vocals. I don't like the vocals. They are too high pitched. The lyrics are not very good. I don't like that they have become so high pitched.

I have tried to find "I'm Not the One, I'm the One

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.
