Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: This is the band's first album that I have reviewed. I had to download it from Amazon, because I didn't have it on CD. I was looking for a new music artist to listen to. I was disappointed with the fact that they are not that good. The vocals were not as good as I thought. Even the songs are not that good, but they are on Amazon, so that's a plus.

Amazon review: I only downloaded this CD because I have been looking for music to help me with my singing. I have always been a song writer, but I never really wrote songs. I always sang songs, but it always sounded like I was just singing someone else's words. I can play the guitar. I can sing. It's always been a dream of mine to learn to sing. The band is really great. They are really different from other singers that I have listened to. The songs are good, but the production is low.

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The voice is a little strange, but the songs, well, not so much.  I will say the songs on the CD are a good representation of his singing and performance.  It is just that the singing is not his strong suit.  He has a lot of talent though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm glad to say I found this CD.  I was really glad they put out this CD.  I don't think I could handle the voice, but the songs are good, and I really enjoy some of them. It isn't his strong suit but he's good at writing the songs.  I really like a lot of them.  I'm really a fan of his.

Amazon review: I've had a lot of trouble with this man's voice, so I was surprised when I found out I could actually record some of his singing.  It's not clear how many songs I can expect to record, but I'm sure I can at least sing 3.  I'm really glad I found this CD, especially since he's been so hard to find.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the best.  I really like this CD so far.  I think I can actually sing a bit of his singing.  His voice isn't that bad, but his writing is.  I feel like the songs are good enough.  I really like the songs on this CD, but I think it might be better if he put out a deluxe version.  I have two other CDs that I can't remember the names of that I bought off eBay, but I think they were from this guy.  The songs on this CD sound like they were taken directly from CD's.  I like his style.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of this artist, you'll definitely want to get his CD.  He's the real deal and he's really good.  I really like his voice, he's got a great voice.

I think he's putting out a lot of really great songs that I've never heard before.  I like a lot of his songs, but I don't think I could sing many of them, but a lot of them are really good.  I think that he's really good.  I think in the future, I would like to have another CD by this artist, but I don't think I could find it.  I think the best CD I've ever bought is his.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1990) - YouTube

Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1990) - YouTube

This is an excellent introduction to the show, and to the concept behind the show. It features a lot of clips which are a great introduction to the show. The show has a lot of music, and a lot of singing around the songs.

It was the first show I ever saw, and it was so good. I have a lot of memories of it, and I feel like I have to see it again. It's become one of my favorite shows.

This is a great show, and it's easy to see why it has such a large and devoted following. Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood is a very simple show in a simple setting. The show is like our family, where you can all get along just fine if you make yourself and each other feel comfortable. The show is based on his love for his neighborhood, and the people who live there. You can watch episodes on YouTube, but here are some episodes you can watch on your own:

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I listen to to this entire set before I go on a job interview.  It strangely empowers me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: To begin, please understand two things about me:  1: I Love Westerns. 2: I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan. Despite that, this junk just doesn't hold up. I wish they would get back to their roots.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album that is far away from anything I would consider a folk-based album. I love the first five songs all the way through, but then the last three songs I just could not stand. I would say the last song is the worst song of the bunch, and is the only song that is not for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So, here we go. Now, if you're still with me, this is a very good album. I've listened to it about three times now and will probably listen to it another three times.  I think I need to re-listen to it. The songs are well-done and have good lyrics. Meghan has a good voice and I understand the lyrics more and more. I think this album will be a good one for Meghan Trainor fans.  I have always liked this singer and her songs. When she releases new music, I will definitely check it out.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I LOVE THIS ALBUM. It's not what you expect from her. It's not a country music album like "Don't Wanna Know" or "All About You." It's a pop/rock album. But she writes a good song. Good lyrics. I hope she releases more music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, but I think I'm going to skip it.  There are good songs on here but I don't feel like the tracks on this album are very good. At times I really enjoy songs on her previous albums, but I don't feel like this one has any redeeming qualities.  I think this album is more of a filler album.  That's it.  No re-listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this CD twice, and it leaves a lot to be desired.  I like the songs on this album, but the music is not what I expected.  Songs like "All About You" and "Don't Wanna Know" are really good songs, but the rest of the album just doesn't do it for me.  I don't know what to say, except that I really like this singer and her songs. I'm getting there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard a lot of negative reviews on this CD.  I am glad I have not had to listen to it, because it really is quite disappointing.  I really hate the last three songs in particular.  I think they are terrible.  I'm not even sure why I like this singer.  She doesn't do it for me. I feel like I've wasted my money.  I'm sure the CD will make a great CD, but I don't need it. I'm sure the CD will be a great album, but I'm not going to listen to it.  I'm not going to waste my money on it.  I don't need to listen to it.  I don't care.

Amazon review: If I could tell you one thing about Meghan Trainor, it would be that she loves her fans.  I have listened to her music for over a year and have yet to be disappointed.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: A few years ago I purchased the CD for my father in the hospital.  It was a really nice album.  When I returned to my car in the parking lot I heard a very loud noise, but I didn't think nothing of it.  When I returned the few days later it would not play and the batteries were dead.  I decided to download the entire CD to my computer because I really liked the music.  Within the first few minutes I had the download program open the cd started playing.  I played the first song on the CD and found it to be very loud.  So I stopped the download, went to the CD and played it again.  I am sure the noise I heard was a noise of the cd player.  I was listening to a cd that had been on for six hours.  I had been listening to it on my car CD player.  The next song I heard was on the same CD player but it was louder than the first song.  After I put the cd in my car the loud noise began, I am not sure what caused it, but it was the same noise.  I returned the cd to the store and bought a new cd player.  I was really pissed that I had wasted my time and money.  I never bought the cd again.  I don't know if it was the cd, or the cd player, or a combination of the two.  I just don't know.  I don't think it would be considered a CD fault, because it was on the CD player, but I don't know why it was so loud.  You can't say that it was the cd player and not say something else.  Now I have a new CD player, and I don't know what caused it.

Amazon review: I got this album for my son's birthday.  I got it for him to listen to while he was in the hospital.  He has a very serious disease, but he is doing better now.  I wanted him to know his father was there.  I would have bought this CD for him, but he needed a CD that would be easy for him to play on his CD player, that would be good music that he would enjoy.  I would have bought it for him, but I am glad my son likes the music.  He can hear it in his mind.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album.  The rapping is very smooth and the songs have a lot of attitude.  Overall though, I wasn't impressed.  The songs are good but the writing is too repetitive.  The beats seem to be pretty generic and the lyrics are the same each time.  I guess it would be a "must have" for every Twiztid fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So glad I got this.  I really liked the first two albums, but this is the best of the bunch.  Twiztid is at the top of his game.  It's hard to compare because of the different style and the different songs.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This recording is by far the best of Schubert's solo piano works, and the best recording of his music made to date. The piano recording, although very well done, is not a "proper" recording. There are no vocals or any other special features, other than a small amount of applause on the end tracks to end the recording. It is just the piano performance, and I believe the piano recording is better than the violin recording. I have listened to this a few times and will have to listen to it again to decide. I am very very pleased with this CD and highly recommend it to all Schubert lovers.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of any choral music that is overly saccharine.  This CD has great voices, but it also has bad lyrics. The choristers were more interested in performing to the crowd than playing the music.    I am surprised by these people's lack of interest to play in a choir.  It is clear they do not know how to play in a choir or how to read music or their own voices.    I think they should be hired to sing at a country club or a school.    I would rather listen to a group of people who do not give a crap about how they sound and are more concerned about the people around them than a bunch of people who cannot get into the music and just want to please the crowd.    It is time to put choral music away for a while and listen to something else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Don't listen to this CD.  It is not for the faint of heart,  it is not a classical choral piece.  The only reason people are singing along in the first few bars is because they are in a church.    I am not a fan of the modern pop style of choral music. I don't want to listen to anyone who is singing along in the middle of a concert.  It is not fun.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am very disappointed in this CD.  It is not a very good piece of music at all.  The choir is very choppy and the lyrics are very boring.   It would have been more interesting if the choir had sung a different song all together.

###
Amazon review: Don't go to a church and listen to this CD.  It is a very boring and uninteresting piece of music.  The choir was not a very good group.  They did not sing in the required order, and they did not sing at all.    The music is very simple and does not have a lot of depth or meaning. The only thing that comes across is a lot of repetition.    The only thing I like about this CD is the voice of the choir.    The lead tenor and baritone voice are very pleasant and have a nice, soothing quality to them.  The tenor is a bit more nasal than the baritone, and they have a very nice range of vocal color.    The singing was somewhat off when the choir was singing other songs in the same key.  There are a few words in the lyrics that are not very important, and there are other words repeated word for word.    The choir could have sung a different song all together.    I do not know if the choir was hired for the same reason I wanted to listen to this CD.    You are not going to be singing any of these songs.    I do not like this music for a number of reasons.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Don't have a problem with the music of this CD.  I can't say the music was bad,  but I found the lyrics a bit confusing.    It was hard to decipher at first.    The choir did not have to be the same number of people.    The choir could have performed this song as a concert piece.    I do not know the reason the choir does not sing in the right order.    The song is not very interesting.    The chorus is boring and repetitious.  The choir was not a very good group.    I do not know why the singer is singing in that high falsetto voice.  He does have a nice, smooth voice, and he does have a very nice range.    The vocals are not very good.    I am not sure why the choir is singing a completely different song in the same key at the end.  I would have liked to hear a different song that the choir could have sung.    The chorus is one of the worst things about this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like this CD.  The songs are all very boring and repetitive.    I am not a fan of the modern pop style choral music.  I don't want to listen to anyone who is singing along in the beginning of the concert.    It is not fun.
Sentiment: Negative

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's album...the first half is really good, and I enjoy most of it but I didn't like the last song, I don't like it, I find it to be inappropriate. I don't think I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: "Lil' Bizness" is all about Lil Bizness. There is no other way to put it. He talks some shit and then makes you his bitch. How he managed to convince me to buy this album is beyond me.

I wish he would have stuck his whole album behind my back instead of selling it to me for $10.00.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am glad I got this album. I do have high hopes for Twiztid's return to form, but this album doesn't deliver. The choruses are so lame in comparison to the rest of the album. The album is all about the rapper's personality and the "new" singer. Not much of a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is just a joke. The album is not worth the $10.00. The album has nothing to do with the rapper that came out with "Twiztid: The Album." The album was just another "Twiztid album" with a rapper that sounds nothing like the guy who came out with Twiztid: The Album. The rapper's voice sounds like he is playing a guitar, but he is not. He just sounds like he is singing. He sounds like a guy that is trying too hard to sound like a rapper. The rapper's voice sounds like an overweight guy trying too hard to sound like a rapper with a low voice. He sounds like a guy who is trying too hard to sound like a rapper. The guy is so bad it drives me crazy. I was going to get the album anyway, but if I had to listen to this album over and over again it would drive me crazy. I did not get the album because it is just another "Twiztid album." It was not worth the money.

Reviewer Comments:

This album is pretty standard Kelly Clarkson, with her signature songs. The album has a good selection of Kelly Clarkson songs (at least a good selection of songs from her 4 albums, and I believe a good selection from her 5th album, which is due to come out this fall).

However, the tracks are not very good. They are not bad. I enjoy Kelly's singing and the songs are good. However, they are not very good. Perhaps, if she could find a better song writing team, she could have a better album.

This is a pretty standard Kelly Clarkson album. I like the songs on here. I really like the songs on here. These are the songs that I have listened to on my iPod, and these are the songs I will listen to over and over again.

I would rate this album 3/5.

The album is not bad. If you're looking for an Eminem album that's not terrible, this one's for you. There's nothing horrible about it. The only thing that could use improvement is the production. The vocals are fine, but the lyrics are horrible. Just listen to the lyrics and tell me if you can find ONE on this album that sounds like Eminem.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
