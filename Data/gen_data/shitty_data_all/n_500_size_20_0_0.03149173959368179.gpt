Amazon review: My wedding song thirty-two years ago
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: This album is a lot of fun to listen to.  There is a lot of variety in the music.  I love the fact that the band plays fast.  My favorite tracks are "Shake It" and "Tear It Down", but the rest are good too, especially "Birds in the Trap Sing".  I like the fact that they bring in a sound of the 80's into the mix.  This album is very popular on the internet, so you might want to check it out if you like music like that.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums that I have heard in a while. This album is like sitting behind the wheel of a car.  You are just driving and everything is moving. You are just flying and everything is in slow motion.  When you finally start to slow down and look back at the road in front of you, you are amazed at how fast you were.  You were like a rocket in the sky, just going fast and never stopping.  It is a great album.

Amazon review: I have been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  The albums I listen to most are their best.  They are the top, or at least one of the top, artists out there.  I have been listening to this album from the beginning and I love it. While listening to the album, I couldn't believe how much this album has grown on me. I have been a fan of Slipknot since their first album.  The music is very entertaining and I have been listening to this album for a long time. The album itself is very good. The lyrics are very good. The production is also very good.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think the music is great, but I also think that the singing is a little off.  The voice is not strong, and it sounds pretty monotone.

Amazon review: I've been waiting for this album for awhile.  I love the songs, and I love the music.  I don't think that you can ever find a bad song in this album.  I would give a few points to the new songs; "Don't Stop" is one of my favorite songs of all time, and "I'm a Stranger" is also very good.  I would give "I'll Be Here" a little more, and I would give the vocals a little more, as I think they're a little cheesy.  However, the original version is amazing and has a certain sound.  I think the new version is a little watered down.

Amazon review: This is a really great album and I'm glad I've decided to buy it.  For the most part, the songs are good, but one song stands out to me as very good, but not in a good way: "Don't Stop".  I'm not very happy with the vocals on that song.  They're kind of weak, and they don't really sound right.  A little over-produced, but not terrible.  The rest of the songs are good.  I give the album a 7.5 out of 10.

I'll probably give him his own copy of the show later to watch on DVD.  I hope he likes it.

Amazon review: This was our first CD (the first two we have had that weren't demo releases) and we were really disappointed.  This is a CD that was suppose to be "good" and was supposed to be "something different, something special."  We were very disappointed.  It was very boring and monotonous.  It had very little new material.  The vocals sounded the same as they did in "Breaking Bad" and nothing that we would call a new or improved track.  There is a song called "The Ghost of Christmas Past" that sounds like it was recorded by a church choir.  We thought that would be interesting.  But, it just sounded very uninteresting.  It sounded like an old Christmas song or one with the same tune over and over again.  It was very boring.  We didn't like it at all.  We will probably only listen to it on a long car ride as we drive to the beach.  We thought it might be funny or something.  It wasn't.  It was just not worth the money.

This song is such a great song with a great message.  I don't know why people really don't like this song.  It's a great song that every person should listen to.  I'm not sure if it's a coincidence that I just can't stand this song, but it's probably the case.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Michael Jackson.  I have been listening to this disc since the first time I heard it.  It is one of my favorite CDs.  My family and I listen to it as often as we can.  I have been buying Michael Jackson DVDs for years.  I have been told there is an English version of the song and I wanted to get it.  I purchased the disc from Amazon and I did not know there was a difference.  I downloaded the English version and then the Spanish version of the song and then I did not know of the difference either.  So now I am listening to it on my ipad and I am frustrated because the discs I purchased are not the same.  I was very disappointed with my experience with Amazon.  I have been shopping for years and I have never had this problem.  I have heard many positive things about Amazon but I never had this experience with them.  I am very angry at them.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

I don't deserve to be hurt   
I always try to make things right   
If I ever break my promise

I always try to make things good   
If I ever break my promise

I am a good person   
I never deserve to be hurt

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: From the album “The Book of Love” by The Smiths.  I know the Smiths were a hard rock band, but I had never heard of them before I heard this album.  I must say, it is quite good.  I particularly liked “The Boy with the Thorn in his Side”.  “The Boy with the Thorn in his Side” is a song that I have listened to MANY times over the years, it always remains a favorite.  It is one of the songs that was cut down on this album, and while I know that this was one of the songs that were cut, I was still surprised to hear that “The Boy with the Thorn in his Side” was one of the songs that was cut.

Amazon review: From the album "Oceans" by The Beatles.  I never could understand the Beatles' musical preferences.  I didn't know who the Beatles were until I saw a video on Youtube and heard the song "Here Comes the Sun" on The Beatles’ "Wings."  I had never heard of The Beatles, but my life changed forever when I saw that video on Youtube and heard that song on The Beatles’ "Wings."  I was captivated, and started listening to The Beatles on the radio.  I never knew there was so much music out there to fall in love with.  I started listening to Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, The Beach Boys, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Byrds, The Beatles, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Beach Boys, The Byrds, The Beatles, The Doors, The Rolling Stones and so much more.

Amazon review: From the album The Best of the Beach Boys "The Best Of".  I have listened to this album several times over the past year.  I am a Beach Boys fan.  I have always been a fan, and I have always loved The Beach Boys.  I still listen to the entire catalog, but I am definitely not a fan of any songs that I heard on this album.  This album is a compilation, and it is the same album I have heard on the radio over the past year.  I am disappointed.

Amazon reviews: This album is so good that I feel bad about being so mean about it.  It is such a shame the band was not allowed to release a version of "California Girls" like they did on the "Best of the Beach Boys" album.  I think that "California Girls" is one of the best songs written about a girl by a man, and it is so sad that the band was unable to record it.  The song "California Girls" is so heartbreaking.  "California Girls" is so sad.  I have listened to "California Girls" MANY times over the years.  It always remains a favorite.

Amazon reviews: This is a really good album.  The album has only one real flaw, and that is the inclusion of "Rope" on the album.  I thought that "Rope" was a good choice for the album, and I thought it was a good song choice for the album, but after listening to it repeatedly over the years, I realized that it is just not a good choice for the album at all.  I remember it being a favorite song of mine, but after listening to it in the past several years, I realized that it is just not a good choice for the entire album.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: "I'm All Right" is an awesome song, that is exactly what it sounds like, a man telling his woman that he cares about her, and that he loves her. Toni Braxton has a voice that will make you swoon, but she needs to work on her delivery. And her delivery is very good, but its not the problem. Its the delivery itself that is the problem, her delivery is that she sounds like a man that is telling a woman that he loves her, and she hears this and thinks to herself, "ohh, he sounds so nice." And the woman does the same. I agree with the other reviewer here that its not a "problem," but its a problem for Toni Braxton. She has a voice that is hard to describe, and its also very good, but its hard to describe. I can't explain it, and I know a lot of people that could tell you this, but she has a very nice voice, but its hard to describe. Its just that her delivery is that good, and I don't know if its her voice, or if its her delivery, but the way she delivers this song, just screams of a man.
