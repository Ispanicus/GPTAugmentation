Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The album "The Heart of the Matter" is a decent album, but there are some songs that could have been better.  The best song on it is "Why We Fight" by the Fugees.  But other than that it's mediocre. I'm not sure if it's the singing on a certain track or not, but "The Heart of the Matter" is not really a strong album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Well, I think it's a great album. I think it's one of the best albums I've ever heard.  I guess I have one thing in common with the "Hail Mary" singer (and some others) - I have a strong preference for songs with great lyrics, the best ones being lyrics that make you think.  This album just doesn't do that to me.  And for me, lyrics with a lot of repetition and cliches are a waste of time.

Amazon review: I'm gonna have to give this one some slack.  This is a great album.  It's definitely not my "fave."  It's not really a bad album.  It's got a few songs on it that I don't like very much.  But it's an excellent album.  And it's worth trying.  It's a good album for the most part, just not my "favorite" album.  I don't know why I like it so much.  It's just not my favorite.  But it is a good album.  And I'm glad to have it.

Amazon review:  I think it's probably my least favorite, but I also think it's probably my most underrated album of all time.  I thought it was a great album when I first heard it in 1994, but I've since heard it about 30 million times and it's just not that good anymore.  But I really like it still.  I think it's a great album full of great songs and songs that just work together.  I think it's a great album.

Amazon review:  I don't hate this album, but I think it's my least favorite of his albums so far.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than some other albums that I do like, but I really don't think I like this album more than any other album.  It's not a bad album, just not my favorite.  I'd have to say that this album is on the lesser end of his albums.  It's not great, but it's not bad at all.  I like it a lot when he does make great albums.  There's just not enough of them.  It's not bad, it's just not very good and he doesn't really make many albums.  I'd have to say that this album is one of the less great albums he's made.  And I don't know why he made it.  And I don't know if he'll ever make another one that's good.  But I'll admit that I love this album, though it's not my favorite.

Amazon review: I never really liked this album.  I didn't really care for it until about a week ago when I realized that I actually liked it.  I think I liked it better when I first heard it, but after a while I thought the quality was slipping.  This album is not for everyone, though.  I mean, the album is okay, but it's not really great.  There are some great songs, but there are also some songs that are average and forgettable.  The album is also not one of the best albums he's done.  I mean, it's better than some of his other albums, but I just don't think it's "great."  But I really like this album.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

This is a really good album. It is pretty much in between the old and new style of Pink Floyd. The problem is that they tried to copy other bands' styles. I know this is a pop record but this is just an album with too many pop influences. The music is catchy and the lyrics are pretty good but the music is just way beyond average.

"I think this is the best Pink Floyd album ever made. The songwriting is really good. The only disappointment is that all the songs go on the same general topic and just repeat the same verses over and over. However, the album is worth it because it's pretty good."

This is my first review. I just wanted to say that I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since I first heard a demo of "Dark Side of the Moon" in 1975. I've seen them many times since then and I still think they are one of the greatest bands to come out of the late 60s. I think this is the best Pink Floyd album ever made. The songwriting, the vocals, the sound quality, the production, the arrangements--they just all work so well together. The album is not perfect but it's definitely one of the best Pink Floyd albums ever made.

This is just a really good album and it's not even that expensive. I think it's worth the money to buy. The lyrics are pretty good, the vocals are pretty good, and the music is pretty good. I just wish they would have made a couple of good songs from the start of the album and left the rest. They could have had a few good songs to start the album if they would have made one or two of the songs from the start.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I then called another customer service number, and they said that the songs were deleted. I tried to download one song that was available for download using the app, but when I tried to download it, it said, "This is not available to download" and I could not download it.

This app is supposed to let you search for music that matches keywords in your email account. I got a lot of results and was really pleased with the results. So I downloaded the app and tried to create an account in the app. After I did, I received a warning that the app was using my email to send the results of my searches. I immediately closed the app and went to a web site to download the search results. I found the source of the warning, and it was a pop-up warning that said that the app was using my email to send the results of my searches to some other website for other people to use. I was surprised that this was happening. I did not intend to give the app permission to send out email results to other people. Not to mention, I never told anyone that I was using this app. The app is also supposed to let you download songs from an internet music site, but not to my knowledge does it actually let you download the songs.

Amazon review: I downloaded the song on 1/20/2010.  I'm glad I did.  It was great!  It's one of my favorites by Carina Round.  I'll be listening to it again and again.  I'm almost done with the album.  It's so good!  I love the album and this song.  I hope they re-release it.  I purchased this album a little over six months ago.  It's so good.  Carina Round is very talented and I'm glad I bought this album.  I'll be buying the next one!

Amazon review: I like this song.  It's got a nice beat to it.  However, the lyrics don't make sense.  I like how Carina Round sings.  But, she should stop singing.  It sounds like she's playing the piano.  She doesn't sing at all.  It's almost like she is playing the piano with her lips.  It's weird

I just hope you'll send me an email so I'll know what the song is.  :)

Amazon review: The song is so beautiful.  However, it is a little annoying because it goes on and on.  I like hearing the song for about 5 minutes.  Then it just stops.  I almost gave up on the song.  It is too long.  I would have much rather heard the song for 5 minutes and then only had to listen to the chorus for a couple minutes.  I don't know why it's so long and why it stops.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This band is doing it again.  This band is doing it again.  They are doing it again.  I've listened to them on two different occasions and they are good.  This time the bass player (who is also the lead singer) sings with a really good voice and the songs are better than the last time I listened to them.  It really doesn't matter what they sound like in the first place, but once again they sound like they're doing it again.  That's all I know I guess.  I don't care what they sound like.  I don't care how many people like them, or what they claim to be, or anything else.  They just have to be better than the last thing I listened to.  I've listened to them twice and I just can't get enough of them.  I feel like I could listen to them for days.  The songs are not bad.  They're just not great.  I would just like to hear them better.  They are just a band that I would like to hear better.  It really doesn't matter what they sound like.  I just need them to sound like something else.  I don't need some "punk" band that has been on for two weeks just to sound good.  I just want this band to sound like something else.  They should be called something else.  I don't care what they sound like.  I just want them to be something that I can enjoy listening to.  Every song sounds the same.  They're just not great.  It's hard to figure out when it is their music or when it is their lyrics.  It's really hard to figure out how it is the same song twice because it sounds completely different when you listen to it.  They're just not great.  It's hard to figure it out.  I feel like this band isn't going anywhere.  I just need them to be somewhere else.  They need to be somewhere else.  They need to be something else.  I just need them to sound like something else, but I can't think of anything else they could be.  This band is just not great.  They shouldn't be "punk" they should be somewhere else.

Amazon review: After listening to this CD once, I just can't figure out where they fit in. I think this is one of the most boring CD I've ever heard.  Their sound is so bland.  Their lyrics are so boring and lame.  I find it hard to believe that a bunch of college kids from the Bay Area could write these lyrics.  There's nothing that makes you feel any emotion and what makes you feel any emotion is not even mentioned.  The songs are just there to be there, no real reason to get up and dance.  I understand that they're trying to sound like a punk band, but I find that they're not really trying all that hard.  They're just trying to sound like a punk band.  There's no real punk in their music.  There's no real punk in their lyrics.  There's no real punk in their sound.  I don't understand how this band is a punk band.  I don't understand how this band is supposed to be punk.  They should be somewhere else.  I'm not sure if I even want to know how this band is supposed to be punk.  They sound like a bunch of college kids from the Bay Area who don't really know what they're doing.  They sound like a bunch of college kids from the Bay Area.  They sound like a bunch of college kids from the Bay Area that are too lazy to get up and dance.  They sound like a bunch of college kids from the Bay Area and they're too lazy to get up and dance.  They sound like a bunch a college kids from the Bay Area that want to sound like a punk band, but they just sound like a bunch a college kids from the Bay Area that don't really care about all the things that make punk bands great.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: This album is a great example of what an 8-track can do.  No, it's not just a great example of what an 8-track can do, it's a great example of what an eight-track can do.  Just as an 8-track can be a great example of what an 8-track can do, it can be a great example of what an eight-track can do.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed listening to this album.  I also think it was the first of three albums I listened to over the summer.  One of those albums was "Good Vibrations by Blondie".  While listening to it, I realized I had heard the song "One Way or Another" before and thought that was a great song.  I really enjoyed the album and thought you had a good one here.

Amazon review: While listening to "The Dark Knight", I was struck by the similarities between this album (which contains "The Dark Knight") and the movie.  The music seemed almost the same, but the lyrics were completely different.  While I enjoyed the movie, I thought this album was just a little overrated.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The Dark Knight is a very good Batman movie.  I'd give it a 6.5/10 but that's due to the fact that the villains of the movie are not very good.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.
