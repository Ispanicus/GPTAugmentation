Amazon review: This album was a gift for my husband on his birthday. It was a gift for him to listen to while he was working on his guitar, and to listen to while he was working on his computer at school. I purchased it as I have heard that the tracks are short and sweet but that is not true. This album is full of songs that will bring you to tears. I will definately be adding this to my collection. Thanks again to Amazon for a wonderful gift!

The music of The Band (The Grateful Dead) is a treasure trove of timeless classics. This album begins just as the band was hitting its stride, with the group performing the classic song "Casey Jones" and "You Enjoy Myself." By the time the songs "Truckin' " and "Let It Loose" are performed on this album, the band is on its way to becoming one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful rock groups of all time.

The Band (The Grateful Dead) began as a jam session of high school students playing songs and singing along to each other. This band has played festivals across the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and South Africa, and has become well-known for the live concerts that they have given around the world. In 1973, the group made their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, and have been on the show to date. The Grateful Dead are now one of the most successful rock groups of all time, selling more than 40 million albums worldwide.

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Most of these are only portions of the songs, such as 1 verse and the chorus.  I would prefer the entire song.  Also, many are done with a "country feel" to them, not the traditional music you would hear in church.  I downloaded it to have songs for senior citizens to sing along with, and it isn't a hit.  Was glad I downloaded it from amazon though as i-tunes was 3 times the price.

I can't believe i forgot about these guys. I had their CD and listened to them a few times back in the day. I must not be as old as i used to be. I had the CD with me and I was really blown away with the lyrics and the band's performance. I had to buy their new CD, but I'm glad I didn't.

First, I must say that this song is absolutely amazing. This is the first time I've ever heard it and I'm almost positive that I will never forget it. I can't help but love everything about this song. The lyrics, the tune, the sound of the instruments, the vocal track, and the melody. I love how the backing instruments sound like the instruments that are supposed to be accompanying the singer. One of the best songs that I've ever listened to and I don't ever expect to forget it.

I hate that song in general.  i think i would have liked the guy have been a bit more upbeat in his songs.  he always had a great voice.

The original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high  definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman PLUS that someone put some strange extra ECHO on the tracks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can only assume it was put together by the same people who did the "Animal Tracks" album.  The same people who made the album "Animal Tracks" made this one.  The music on this one is of a very mediocre quality and with a distinct lack of depth.  The songs sound the same, or very similar, to the ones on "Animal Tracks" but have none of the depth.  This is a great song.

Amazon review: I enjoy listening to this album... But the song "I'm Not a Big Fan of Old School Country" has been cut off.  It's a shame, because this album is very good.  I only wish the song had been included.  I don't mean to sound like I'm dissapointed, but this album is the best album that I have ever heard.  This is not a bad album, but not as good as I'm expecting.  It's just not the best I have heard.  I do recommend it, but I would suggest cutting off the song "I'm Not a Big Fan of Old School Country" as it's a bit annoying.

It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.

I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way. I can think of only three movies I've ever seen in the theater and have an album of music that I have always liked.
But the first time I heard the movie "I Love You" by Amy Lee it made me feel that the movie was worth the 2 hours of my life I spent in the theater.
I thought I was in love with Amy Lee. I would sing and dance around my room while playing the game "I love you" over and over again.
It was just the way I wanted to feel. The whole movie was such an emotional roller coaster.
The song I love you by Evanescence was the soundtrack to my life. Amy Lee and Evanescence have been a huge part of my life since I was a kid. I have listened to their music for years.
And when the movie "I Love You" came out I was on cloud 9. I couldn't wait to see the movie. I bought the soundtrack hoping that it would be a perfect movie soundtrack to my life.
I can't believe I'm the only one who feels this way.
I was on cloud 9 too until I heard the movie "I Love You".
My brain didn't want to believe what it was hearing.
I thought the movie was a rip-off of the movie "The Notebook". I thought the movie wouldn't be as good as the movie "The Notebook".
I was wrong.
The movie "I Love You" by Amy Lee is so much better than the movie "The Notebook". Amy Lee wrote the song "I love you" in the movie "The Notebook", but she didn't write the song "I love you".
The movie "I Love You" is much better than the movie "The Notebook".
I'm sorry, I used a very strong word.
The movie "I Love You" is a better movie than the movie "The Notebook".
I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way.

It's the same with the soundtrack of this movie.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

They are good at playing the songs and singing the songs.  I don't think they should be called "David Lee Roth's Van Halen".  That's just stupid.  There are some good songs on this album, but there are some really, really average songs.

Beautiful - Best vocal in history

Posted May 15, 2008

This is a great song. I grew up listening to the band, so it really means a lot to me. Lyrics are great, too.

I have nothing against the band, but I thought the vocals were way too flat in this particular song. The vocals were almost non-existent and the entire song was nothing other than a repetition of the same words. I felt like I was being taken to "high school" because the vocals were so poor.

Amazon review: The majestic song Dead Or Alive opens this 1981 album on which Cale is backed by Sturgis Nikides, Jim Goodwin, Peter Muny & Robert Medici. Alone worth the price of the album, this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet lines of John Gatchell. A live version with a significantly different feel appears on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Comes-Alive/dp/B001IJZ188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: this is a CD that should be burned to a CD for the kids to play it on the CD player.  Its like listening to a compilation CD of what's been cut from other people's albums.

If you don't like sad songs then I am sorry to tell you, but I didn't like this CD at all.  I really don't know why people buy these CD's.  I don't know if I will buy any more from this label.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I have been listening to the song "Let's Get Lost" all day and I love it.  I'm not sure if the lead singer of this band is in it but she is very good at singing and I think she deserves a Grammy award.  I like the way that the band plays, they are very smooth, it is easy to get into their music.  It seems to be more pop than country but that doesn't mean it is bad.  The songs are all very good.  I recommend this CD and that it is on Amazon.  You can't compare a CD to a CD and not know what you are listening to.  Good music is good music.  I can't really think of any bad songs on this CD.  I like how this album is on one side and the rest of the songs are on the other side.  That makes it easy to flip through the CD.  I wish that the CD had a little more songs.  I would have like to have heard the songs "You Never Know" and "What If I Could Turn Back Time".  Also "What Do You Want?" and "If That's What You Need".  I would have liked to have heard songs with a little more thought.  It would have been great to have heard "Come On".  I like a little variety in a CD.  It would have been great to have heard a little more of the artists songs.  It would have been great to have heard a little more of "I'll Never Break Your Heart" and "Good Morning Good Morning".  But like I said I have been listening to this CD all day and I love it.  I was happy to find this CD on Amazon.  I will keep listening to this CD and maybe buy the CD in a few months when the CD gets older.  I hope that the CD gets released in a few months.  I will keep listening to this CD.  It is worth it.  I recommend this CD.  It is worth it.

Amazon review:  I bought this tape off of Amazon, and so far I enjoy it just as much as I did when I bought it.  I am a huge fan of Derek's music and have been since he first came on the scene.  I had a lot of fun listening to it.

Amazon review:  It's a small tape, and I can't really say much about the music on it because I haven't really listened to it much.  I like the music, but I'm not really sure exactly what kind of songwriting Derek is doing on the tape.  I've heard some really good stuff, but I don't know that I have any definitive favorites.  It's a good tape.

Amazon review: Not a big fan of the music on this tape.  It's mostly noise.  He should get better equipment.

Overall Thoughts: Derek Horton's New Tape is a pretty average tape.  On the whole, the music on it is good, but the sound quality is not what I would have expected from him.  The songwriting is mostly noise and noise, and as a result it's not very good.  I think he should get better equipment.
###
Overall Score: 2.5/5.00

Overall Thoughts: Derek Horton's New Tape is a pretty average tape, but it is a decent tape in that it is a decent tape, which is something I can't say about most of his recordings.  On the whole, he's doing alright, but he's not exactly a great artist.  He's a good musician, but he should improve his equipment, write more songs, and do a proper album.

on a radio interview with Derek Horton where
he was talking about the band.

Amazon review: Don't have much to say about this as this was something I had not
even ordered.  No real words for this at all.

Amazon review: I'd like to order this with the intention of
listening to it in the near future.  It would be great if he
wrote some more songs for a future release.

Amazon review: I am a little late to join the party when it comes to this artist, but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for Thinking Out Loud on youtube (I didn't realize it had been played to death on the radio according  to friends)  I love  the cd. It is awesome to find an artist that actually plays real instruments, writes their own music, with lyrics that actually convey human emotions. Wonders never cease.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review:  This is a great song, but I really don't like it.  There's just something about it that makes me extremely annoyed.  It's a song about love and a lot of people have a lot of love in their hearts, but this song is about jealousy, anger, and hate.  I also don't like the fact that this song is basically a call for a man to go to his ex wife with the intention of getting back the man she dumped him for and that she'll give him all the money she's got.  
Just the fact that this is a song about jealousy and anger is enough to make me not like it.   Even though it's catchy, I just don't like it.  
I still like to sing it though because I like the song, and I like how it makes me feel even though it makes me want to shout at the man.  
I think I'd be happy if someone put me in jail for this song.  
The song's not bad though.  But I don't like it, and I'll be glad when someone else sings it because I hate it.
I don't even want to waste my time reading these negative reviews.  I don't even want to think about them right now.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: I thought my having just downed a hard cider was making me hear this song in some distorted way, but after reading everyone's reviews, I now see it's not me on a buzz. This song is just horrible. It's off-key, the vocalists can't carry a tune in a bucket, and is that the sound of cats fighting in the background?  As Frank Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond used to say, Hooooly CRAP. Thank God it's free AND I could hit Cancel on the download.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: Being a band nerd, I like listening to band music.  This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.  I was selected to play in the KKPsi/TBS National Intercollegiate Band in 1993, and we performed his "A Walk in Jurassic Park".

Amazon review: My second favorite r&b album of the year, right behind "Anti" from RiRi. This was a grower at first but it's bumpin' loud around the house now. It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator". The rest of the album is great like "Team You"! "Coolin'! & "Smoove Jones Afta Glow Show!{Outro} but  "One Man Woman" is weak.

Amazon review: Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if it's been covered before but here is a great song from the '90s called "Love is a Rock n Roll Disease". It's about relationships in the rock n roll world and how love is a disease. It's a great song and I think it would be a great song for a live performance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I know this is a long song but it's so important. It's a cover of "Tears In Heaven" by the Eagles. But it's not just that. It's a great song about how we are all alone in this world and there is no one else on earth we can truly call our own. If you're ever feeling down or lonely, just listen to this song and you'll be reminded of the true meaning of life and that even if you're not with someone, there is someone else on this earth that you can truly be proud of. If you don't have anyone to count on, then you're living in a dream world.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the last few years of Mark Knopfler.  If I had to pick one song to describe him, it would be 'I Believe.'  The song is a great message to say to someone who is doubting their faith.  It's a great message whether you're a believer, or just someone who's not sure of what to believe.  I like the song, but i think it would be better if it was played in the background along with other Christian songs like 'Jesus Loves Me'

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

His death in an auto accident at 39 years old was a shock but his music is still relevant today.  I have a lot of respect for Tom Petty.  He was a legend.  You could say that he was a mentor to many musicians.  Some believe that he was the best singer.  I would have to agree with that, he had a beautiful voice.  As a performer he was outstanding.  The voice is what made him special.  There are many great singers out there, but there are only a few who can sing Tom Petty's voice.

Amazon review: A lot of music gets made by people who are great at music and have a natural talent for music. This is not one of those albums.  This is an album about a guy who is a professional musician and has spent a lot of time on this album.  But what I mean by that is it is like listening to a guy who has done a lot of hard work but is not a natural musician.  It doesn't have the musical talent.  These songs are not that good.  They really don't have a unique sound.  They all sound like other songs with some sort of music.

I like to listen to the music and find a song that I like.  I don't read reviews to decide whether or not a song is good or not.  If you don't like a song you should go out and listen to it or buy it.  I did not buy this album.  I don't like the music.  I don't listen to music on headphones and I don't listen to music while I eat.  I don't mind other people's opinions.  I have read other reviews and found them to be valid.  I just did not like this album.  I just don't think it is a good release.

Some of them are really good, some of them are not.  The music on this album is not a good release at all.  There is no music on this album that is unique.  It is just a bunch of songs that just sound like other songs.  I think it is a bad release.

It is typical Shadow ambiances and found sounds, but some tracks have wildly swung broken beat patterns like Flying Lotus and the like. A few tracks attempt a dubstep feel, but it comes across as plodding. A couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns and tripleted patterns.
