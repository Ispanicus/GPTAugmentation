Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: Richie sounded good when I heard him on Howard, but the CD sounds overproduced and too electronic. Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have three sons, and they are all grown.  I knew a few of them were fans of Richie, but they had no idea that I played a few songs off of this album for them.  They loved it.  And so did I.  I even gave it to my daughter and she loved it too.  I didn't think I was going to like it, but I really did.  Thanks Richie.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this as a gift for my husband.  I love the guitar playing, and he was a big fan of Richie, but he loves his drums.  But when I played him the tracks on this CD, his ears perked up!  He said "wow, I didn't know you could play Guitar like that."  He's definitely a Richie fan now.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend.  I love Richie and so does he.  I love his singing and think he's one of the best vocalists of all time.  I love the songs on this CD.  They are all so beautiful.  I especially love "Crazy" and the other songs are as well.  I don't think I could play his songs.  I can't even remember the first time I heard them.  I love this CD!

Amazon review: I bought this album when I was 16, and I'm now 33.  I love Richie.  I love the songs on this CD.  I've listened to it over and over and over.  I still have it on my computer.  It's just that I don't listen to it very often, and I keep finding out new songs on this CD.  I love it.  It's just the way I like to listen to music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because it's Richie's first album.  I've had Richie in my mind for a long time, but didn't know what to expect or how to react when I got the album.  This album is good.  I love the songs.  I play them all the time.  I don't listen to it all the time, but when I do, I love it.  It's the best of all time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was an instant Richie fan since I first heard him on the radio and I've had him in my mind for a long time.  I bought this album when I was 16.  It's amazing.  I love the songs.  I love Richie.  He has the most beautiful, soulful voice that I don't think I've ever heard before.  I'm very happy with my decision to buy this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I went to a music store, bought a CD I thought I'd like, but it wasn't what I expected.  I'm very glad I bought it because I love it.  It's a great album.  I bought this as a gift for a friend.  I was surprised to find that there were two versions of the CD.  It doesn't matter which version, but I like the second one better.  I bought it with the "new" album.  It's different, but I like it.  It's my favorite Richie album.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I purchased this at the same time as the new one, but I think I'll wait for it to come out on DVD.

Amazon review: I bought the new CD, but I waited to hear it on the iPod, and I was very excited.  I don't know how I would live without it.  I have been listening to it a lot, and I love it.  I had to buy the DVD as well, but I can't wait to see how it comes out.  I love Richie.  I hope it is as good as the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I loved this album when I first listened to it in high school. The only bad thing about it was the lyrics. I have to say, though, that I did not get the "new" version of this album when it was first released. I think I bought the "old" version, but I don't remember. I've listened to it a few times since then, and I don't like it, not at all! I'm not a huge fan of hip hop, and I can understand why some people think that this album is good. I don't think this album is the worst hip hop album of all-time, but it isn't hip-hop at all. It's just a bunch of non-stop rap songs. As for the vocals, they sound terrible! I can't believe that this album was released as a re-release. The album I am talking about, of course, is Jay-Z's The Blueprint. That album has some excellent songs that are well-sung and have good lyrics and music. This album sounds nothing like those songs. It's a bunch of rap songs that sound like they were recorded in the studio with a band. It's just awful. I wish that this album had been released as a compilation, so that more people would have been able to hear it and feel the good things that it has to offer. I know I will be purchasing this album again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this album to review it, but it doesn't seem to be working. I did find out that the album had new songs on it, but they didn't really sound any better than the old songs. This album is a lot of different songs, but they don't sound any better. I haven't listened to the songs yet, but I don't think they sound any better than the previous ones. There isn't really an album for young lovers, and this album doesn't really do anything for me. I'm an old soul at heart, but I just can't get into this album.

"The Love Song" (Grateful Dead)


Lyrics:


Hanging on a thread that can't be seen
Is a love that can't be known
Is a love that can't be told
Is a love that can't be felt
And I cling to that love like a lover
Closing my eyes and dreaming of you
Till the dawning day brings me your love
I cling to that love like a lover
Closing my eyes and dreaming 'bout you
Your love is a love that can't be known
Your love is a love that can't be told
Your love is a love that can't be felt
And I cling to that love-like a lover
Closing my eyes and dreaming of you
Till...



Lyrics by:


Bass Solo:

I can't help it.
I can't help it.
I

I can't help it.
I can't help it...
I

(repeat 2X, fades out)
I'm lost in a labyrinth of love.
(repeat 2X, fades out)
I'm lost in the labyrinth of love.
(repeat 2X, fades out)



Chorus:


Hanging on a thread that can't be seen

Is a love that can't be known

Is a love that can't be told

Is a love that can't be felt

And I cling to that love like a lover

Closing my eyes and dreaming of you

Till the dawning day brings me your love

I cling to that love like a lover

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: As a singer, I prefer R&B and do not usually put myself in a group with other female singers.  This is one of the few songs on this album that I have to admit I actually liked. I think the songs are pretty much on par with the other songs on the album.  The song is very well done and the vocal performance is awesome.  The instrumental is fantastic.  I thought the song was a little short, but it still had a good amount of energy.  I think the group has produced another fine album and I hope they stick with it.  
Truly, this is the best R&B album of this genre released in the last few years.  I would put them in the top five of all the best R&B/Soul albums of all times.  The song is very well sung and the overall performance is wonderful.  The only flaw I could think of was that the instrumental performance is somewhat lacking.  But I don't think this will be a "problem" for a lot of people.  The song is very well played.  I think the song is very well sung.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I loved this album!  I think you can tell from the first listen that this album is made up of "real" songs.  They are all great and I would listen to this album over and over again if I had the chance.  The songs are all great and if your into the music this album will not disappoint.

Amazon review: One of the most interesting, well-produced, and well-sung vocal records of the year.  It was a little slow in the beginning, but the album keeps on going.  The album is good, but it is not as good as it should be.  I can only remember one song that I liked on the album.  I have not heard this album lately (but I do know it was released in 1978) so I will not be reviewing it.  I am glad I listened to it.

Amazon review: This is one of the better early R&B albums.  The music is very good.  Although the recording is very hit and miss, it is very good.  The recording is very good for this time.  The only problem is that there is too much of an emphasis on the vocal performances.  The group has an excellent voice, but they have to overdo it in order to get the desired sound.  It is very difficult to balance the voice and the instrumentation.  The result is a very good album that is very hit and miss.

There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of hip-hop produced by Dr. Dre.  The only reason I give it four stars is because it is fun to listen to and you can get a feel for someone that you may not have ever heard of like Dr. Dre.  The songs are fun to listen to and I am sure many will enjoy them.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

I love the songs, the lyrics, the arrangements, the instrumentation and the way they blend into each other. I love that this is the first Deftones album where vocals are not heard. I also like how the album sounds. It can be easily placed in the same genre as Deftones. I also like the fact that this album has never been released on CD. That is a plus point. I wish they would release a two CD set with the first CD being the original album and the second being a remix.

Amazon review: First of all it's a great album. I think that if you're not into the Deftones, then you'll probably not like it. But if you're into the Deftones, then you'll love it. If you have to choose between this album and the last album you listened to, then, without a doubt, I'd choose this album. It's a good thing that this is the last Deftones album because I am extremely disappointed that they didn't release an extended play. It would have been great to have this album come out on vinyl.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I will look forward to the next albums from this artist.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It is a bit like listening to a female version of The Beatles.  It's great for people that are easily impressed and want to hear a female in their genre.  It's great for people that like to listen to female music.  Enjoy!

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

I have two records coming in the mail today, one for my daughter and one for myself. I can't wait to hear how the album sounds and how it compares to the other albums I own. I have been listening to some of the same bands, too, for the last 20 years or so. So, I can imagine that the records will be similar. The records are both in very good shape and have been well looked after. The first record is one that I have been wanting to get for a long time now. I don't know of any other records that I would give the kind of money for.

This particular record is going to be my last purchase from Amazon. I don't know what will happen, but I have just decided that I will be switching over to buying from CD's only and will be saving money while also saving some frustration. So, I will be shipping the CDs in the mail and will not be looking at Amazon.com any longer. I am starting to look at the different formats of purchasing and I am starting to get excited about using CD's again. This is my first CD purchase of the year and I am really excited to be getting it. I am not looking to spend money on CD's right now, but I do want to get this one and I am excited to have a new CD that I can listen to all day long. I will be excited to have the CD arrive and will be listening to it right away.

This is our first purchase from Amazon. Our first purchase was the new James Blunt album, "Winchester Cathedral". We have listened to that album several times now, and we are still finding it to be a great album. We went to the concert last week and were very impressed with the quality of the concert. The sound was very good, the band was very entertaining, and the concert was very well done. We have heard other concert recordings, but this is the first time we have heard live music that we have found to be very good. We will be sure to listen to the new Blunt album again.

We have just received our first two CDs from Amazon. We have not purchased anything from Amazon in a while, and we were really excited to receive our first two new music CDs from Amazon. Our first CD was the album "Sister Rosetta's Christmas Wish" by The Flaming Lips. We have listened to the album several times now and are still finding it to be a great album. We went to a concert last week and were very impressed with the quality of the concert. We found the sound to be very good, the band to be very entertaining, and the concert to be very well done. We have heard other concert recordings, but this is our first time listening to live music that we have found to be very good. We will be very happy with our first two CDs from Amazon. We will be sure to listen to the new Lips album again.

I have a friend who has an account on Amazon.com that is very close to being mine. I would love to get a copy of her

Amazon review: I am an amateur musician and have many songs on my computer and I love a lot of them. I have not been able to find a song on this album that I like. This is the 5th time I have tried to download this song. I have tried to connect to the internet with my computer and I have tried to download the song with my cell phone but I still have not found one song that I like. I would like to give this CD a rating of  1-2 stars but I am giving it just a single star because I'm not able to rate it. A rating of 1 star would be to say I don't like it but not to rate it. I am truly disappointed and I will not give any stars to my rating. I will give the star rating to the other CD's on this site.
