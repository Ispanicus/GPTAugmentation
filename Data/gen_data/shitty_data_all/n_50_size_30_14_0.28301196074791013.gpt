Amazon review: This is a great album and the best metal in the 90's. My favorite tracks are "The Night Will Fall" and "I Am the Law". The lyrics are top notch.

Great album and great production.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

A:

You mean the line where he says "I gotta sing, I gotta sing."  It's actually a very good example of how to use the technique of breath control to give the voice a "ringing" quality.  
The other lines that he says that are similar to the above, where he uses the technique of breath control, are actually better examples.  My favorite is "I can't sing, I can't sing."  When people talk about the "singing voice," they really are talking about this one.

 "I sing it on my own, but it's just a matter of time before I'll have it."  
"There's a lot of people out there that can't sing."   
"I don't care to sing."

Here's an example that works better when used in a different way.  It may seem obvious, but you'll see why I say it's better next.
He also said "I can't sing, I can't sing."  
"I don't sing the songs I sing"

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I guess there was something great about the fact that they put out a live album, but this one is just too generic.  It's not an album, it's not a live album, it's not an AI song, it's not an AI compilation.  It's just a CD that someone put out that has a few songs from AI 2006, and a few songs from AI 2007.  It doesn't have the soul or the feeling that I think one would get from an AI song.  It's just a generic album.  I could care less about any of the songs.  I guess it's just a good album for people who like AI, but I'm not a fan of AI music; I'm a rock music fan.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was hoping for a bit more soul in this album, but I guess I'll just have to live with it.  I like the variety of songs on here, but it's just too generic.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this album did it right, and I am glad they did it. I don't think this was a bad album at all, but it just wasn't nearly as good as the other songs on here.  It had some of the songs I wanted to hear, but others I didn't.  The only one that I thought was missing was "You Never Know."  It's just hard to see this album as the winner.  The two songs I did like were "The Last Time" and "It's a Love Song."  Both are excellent songs, and they were both good songs that I thought were missing on here.  The two songs I didn't like were "So Far Away" and "I'm Not a Hero."  Both of those are just generic songs that don't do anything for me.  The songs are all good, just not all that great.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  The first single I listened to was "Be Still", and I was not disappointed.  I love the way Lin Manuel sang it.  I had not known he had a voice like that until he sang it on the album.   I have to say that I am totally hooked on this band and will buy all their CD's.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album repeatedly, and every time I listen to it I get a little more into it.  The CD is very well structured and has a lot of great songs.  The songs are all really memorable to me.  I can't imagine how a person would lose interest in something like this if they just listened to it for the first time.  Once you start listening to it you can hear the different parts of the songs and the different parts of Lin Manuel's voice.  Lin Manuel has very good singing and I really like how he is able to sing the songs in a different way each time.    The choral pieces are great and I really like his use of the choir to fill out the songs.  They are all short enough that you can enjoy them and you don't have to listen to them all in one sitting.    The album has a lot of great songs, all of which I would love to hear Lin Manuel sing but I think he is a little too young for the role of Machete and would prefer to sing other roles like J. Alfred Prufrock.    Overall I would recommend this CD to any singer/songwriter/musician who likes great music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I can't believe I am about to write a review about this album.  I am really hoping that Lin Manuel will be able to re-write the lyrics for the new material that is on this CD.   He did a great job with "Be Still" and "I Won't Let Go".    Lin Manuel really has a voice like no other.  I don't know if Lin Manuel is a singer that anyone could imitate but he is definitely a singer that can live up to the role of Machete.  I love Lin Manuel and I really hope that he has the opportunity to sing other great roles.

Amazon review: I was introduced to Lin Manuel Miranda through his song "Be Still."   He has been one of my favorite artists ever since.    I had heard the songs that he sang on the album that I thought were the best songs in the world.  I was looking forward to hearing the rest of the album because he was an amazing singer.  He is definitely a singer that I have been waiting to hear.  I was really surprised at how great the album was from the first song I heard.   I think I have heard some of Lin Manuel's best work.  It is definitely a different voice that I have not seen before.  His singing is very smooth and I really like his vocal range.    I really liked that he sang the song "I Won't Let Go."    I think that he could sing that song better than any other singer that I have heard.  "I Won't Let Go" was a really great song.     I think that Lin Manuel can sing and do a lot of really great things.    I think that he will be able to do a lot of really good things.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I was never a fan of the New Kids On The Block, but I did like the music. I like the music of the New Kids On The Block. What happened to that band. They have become more like the Pussycat Dolls. Lame.  The New Kids On The Block are not even close to the New Kids On The Block that I remember. I liked the band from the beginning. I have to give them credit for keeping their musical integrity and trying to stay true to their original sound. They are still the New Kids On The Block. But they have become the Pussycat Dolls and the New Kids On The Block. No one can forget the sound of the New Kids On The Block.  I agree with some, I am not a fan but I liked them. I liked their music. I liked their stage show. I liked their attitude. I liked the little girl with the golden voice. I liked the lyrics. I liked the fact that they were original. I liked the fact that they did things their own way and stayed true to their musical integrity. But the New Kids On The Block have gone to the Pussycat Dolls and the New Kids On The Block. I have to agree with the other reviewer, this album sounds like a high school band playing the same stuff over and over.  They are becoming "pop" artists.  I like the music but I have to agree that the music is becoming more like a "high school band playing the same stuff over and over."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The packaging is nice, and the songs are great.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this CD, and I am sure you are not either.  I think the CD is good for a very basic collection of song, but if you do not know what you're getting into this CD is not for you.  If you are not a musical person you might want to listen to the songs in the order they are listed.  I would not recommend this CD unless you are a fan of classical music.  If you have friends that are die-hard fans of classical music, this CD will be a hit.  If you are a classical music fan, this CD will be a hit.  But if you are a casual listener, this CD will not be a hit.  If you are not a classical music fan this CD is not for you.  However, this CD was not only produced by a man that is a fan of classical music, he is a fan of women.  He is a fan of Thalia.  This CD is a hit and I recommend it.  Get it while you can.  You are a die-hard fan of classical music.  This CD is a hit.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is one of the better albums I have heard by The New York Choral Society.   I especially like the songs with the high melodies and beautiful harmonies.  The music is very enjoyable.   I have heard the songs sung by very talented singers, and I have listened to several of them, but they were always somewhat flat and boring.   Although I really liked 'A Nightingale Sang In Barkley Square', I have to say that I was disappointed in the performances.  The music was just too repetitive.   The other songs, on the other hand, sounded great, and they were performed with a lot more emotion and life.

I have downloaded this CD onto my iPod, and I am listening to it while I am driving.   The songs are so beautiful, and I love to listen to these great songs.   This CD is worth the money.  When I buy an album I always start by listening to it.  I have listened to this CD several times and I am still amazed.   I don't know what to tell you.  I really like the songs.

I am a big fan of this album. I was surprised to find this album in my iTunes. I have always enjoyed the sound of hip hop music. For some reason, I like this album much more than I do AI. I am disappointed that the songs are so short. I would much prefer a longer album. I am not a fan of the song selection either. I would much rather have included the songs that I love from other albums, rather than just a few of their songs.

It seems like it would be fun to have the whole album in one download. I wish they would come out with a companion download that includes AI as well.

5/5 stars

The last track on this album is really good, but the song selection is horrible. I would really like to see this album expanded.

This is actually my favorite album of all time, although I'm not sure if I'd recommend it, since the songs are so short. But this is the best album by the guys I've ever heard. Great lyrics, great music, and the songs are just so good. I'd recommend this album to anyone.

I bought this album after I found a review saying it was the "next big thing". It's been a while since I've heard it, but I'm glad I bought it. I've been listening to this album non-stop since I purchased it. It's pretty good. The songs aren't too long, and the music

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I would like to encourage anyone to seek out and purchase this record. It is quite a fine collection of songs. I like their ability to get away with the word "awesome" in the title of this record. I was able to have some fun with this recording. I also enjoyed the use of the musical symbols. I have listened to many songs before and enjoyed them but when I discovered this music I found myself having fun.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful set of songs.  I have bought many of these recordings, and I usually do not buy other people's.  I have to admit I was hesitant to buy this one because it has been on my "top 100" list for a while, but I guess I just had to buy it. Not only is this a great collection of songs but it is also a great album. I have listened to other people's CD's before, but this one is really good.  I have listened to this CD more than once, and I can tell you that the difference is night and day.  It is that good.  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in the CD, but that doesn't mean I didn't love it.  I love the fact that they put out a new CD every year.  I have been a fan of this band since I was in third grade.  I have been a fan of this band for almost 40 years.  I can't say enough good stuff about this band. This is one of my all time favorite CDs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music of the band is very diverse.  This set was recorded in 2000.  All of the vocals are performed by the same person.  Every song is different and features a different vocalist.  The set starts off with a slow funk song that I never really listened to before.  That song is followed by a more  upbeat song, with a slow beat.  The next song is a very upbeat song, but it doesn't follow the same template as the previous songs.  The rest of the song is pretty  similar.  I really liked this cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The first song is good but the last 4 are not very good.  This is a collection of original songs that were written by the trio.  The lyrics are very simple, but the melody is very catchy.  However, the melodies are all too similar.  The rhythm is also very repetitive.  I wish there were more original songs to listen to.  This collection is good for people who like the music of this band.

Amazon review:  These guys are actually really good.  When I was a kid I used to listen to this band.  Their music is very good.

I guess I prefer this music over  most of the CD's I've heard, but I'm having trouble finding a CD  that I like more.  This is certainly the best  cd I've heard to date.

Amazon review: This was the first CD I ever purchased.  I bought it in 2001 and it still works.  I listen to it all the time.

The music is also simple and easy to understand.  The vocals are very good.  The only problem I have is that I don't know why they  don't make more CDs.  I've had this CD for over 15 years and it still works and  plays just like new.

Amazon review: This is an excellent CD.  It has a good mix of the different styles of acoustic music, but it also has a good mix of other styles.  I think this album shows the best of acoustic music.  The songs are fairly short, but they are very well written.  The lyrics are very simple, and the melodies are very catchy.  With all of these things, I think this is a great cd.  The only thing I don't like is that it only has one song.  However, I think that one song  is great.

Amazon review: If you love pop music, this is not the album for you.  It is so over done,  it's like someone wrote a song and said, "Hey, we need a bunch of pop songs and we'll put this one here."
