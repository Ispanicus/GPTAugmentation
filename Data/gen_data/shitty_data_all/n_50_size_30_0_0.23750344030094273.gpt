Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

This is a song that would be a perfect song for a worship service or a family gathering.  I have heard this song sung by various Christian singers and most of the singers have done a good job.  This is one of the few songs that has me thinking about worship when I am not worshiping.  The lyrics are very descriptive.  The music is not the best it has ever sounded.  This is one of the few songs that has me thinking about Worship when I am not worshiping.  This is a song that I would like to hear many times in the future.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I'm gonna say this is the worst song title I have heard.  I have heard this song before, but not with the title of this song.  I was listening to this and I thought this is something different, but after listening to this song, it sounds as if someone took a lot of the words from this song and put them into this song.  I don't know why the artist just said "I wanna go" and "I wanna go" without saying anything else.  It just sounds like just being silly and saying "Yeah, I wanna go to the store."  The song should have said "I wanna go to the store" and "I wanna go to the store."  The song should have said "I want to go to the store."  Or just "I want to go."  I don't know why the artist said "I wanna go."

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I've never really listened to her music.  It was just that I always had her on the radio when I was in college.

Amazon review: This album was just a little too pop for me.  I didn't feel like I needed to listen to it again, but I did feel like the songs were a little repetitive.  I don't know.  I felt that this album is pretty good, but it's not perfect.  I would like to see her back on the radio.  I would like to see her back on the radio, but I'm not sure if she will make another album.

Amazon review: This is a bad album.  I hate to tell you this, but I really don't like this album.  I do not like it.  I do not understand it.  I have listened to it a second time, but I just can't listen to it anymore.  I'm not going to listen to this album again.  It's just not for me.  I just I don't understand why I would listen to the first two albums.  I really didn't like them.  I was in college, I didn't have money to listen to music, I needed this music to get through the day.  I just don't want to listen to the first two albums.  This album is just bad.  I don't understand why I would even want to listen to it.  I just can't listen to it.  I just don't like this album.  It is just not for me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: "What's In A Name" is a song that reminds me of my daughter's favorite, "Rainbow Connection" (a song that I must have sung to her many times as a child).

The melody is beautiful, with a nice beat that reminds me of the oldies, "Carol of the Bells."

Amazon review: I love this album.  This album has been on my wish list for a long time.  I have only listened to it once, and I loved it.  I bought this album when it was on sale at my local music store (and that's all I did, so don't get mad if you're not down with me).  Now that I've bought this album, I've been listening to it non-stop since it came out.  This album is good, but it is not as good as it could have been.  I believe that this album could be even better if they would work on the lyrics and the music.  I like the songs a lot, but there are several songs that I don't like.  One song in particular, "One Time" really rocks.  I have never listened to any of their singles, but this one song is my favorite.  This album rocks.  I really think that this album is the best of the three albums that they have made.  This album is just perfect.  It's one of my favorite albums.  I would recommend this album to everyone, but I really think that the album is just too good to be true.  I love this album.  It's a must for anyone who loves rock music.  I have never been able to get this album at any record store, so I was happy to see that it was on sale at my local music store. This album is great, so I just have to wait for the third album.  I will recommend the album to everyone I know.  This album is one of my favorite albums.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves rock music.  I have never been able to get the album at any record store, so I was happy to see that it is on sale at my local music store.  This album is great, so I just have to wait for the 3rd album.

Amazon review: It's good to have a CD collection of the greats that came before you. When I was a young kid a record by someone like Elvis or Hank Williams was just as important as a book of poetry or a novel. There's something to be said for being introduced to the stories and poems of those who came before us. But I think that album's message is really a bit too preachy. The lyrics are a bit too on the nose, too simple, and the chorus is just too monotonous. It's like someone tried to write a sermon in a song. I couldn't listen to it for more than 15 minutes without getting bored. I didn't finish it because the message just was not what I think it was trying to say. The lyrics are "I'll Be There for You" and "Love Me Do" but they don't really say much of anything. If you've got an hour to kill and you want to relax, there's a lot of great songs on this CD. I would recommend it.

I've never heard it without the drums and bass playing, and each time I hear it, I love it more and more.  "I'm Not The Man" is a great song.  It has a lot of great lyrics and very catchy.

I guess I was just looking for a little bit of excitement and originality that I wasn't going to find after listening to this garbage.  I'm not sure what's going on here, but this record just makes me feel bad about myself.  I am so over the fact that I have to say that.  I don't know what else to say, but I would really like to hear the whole album.  No offense to the band, but this album isn't for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this album.  It's not the worst album I've ever heard, but its nowhere near the best.  There is one song that is probably my favorite song on the whole album, but most of the songs are pretty mediocre to me.  I didn't like this album at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never been so disappointed in a music album.  I would put this in the worst category, but its not quite that bad.  The band gets a 5/5 rating from me and I think they should get a 5/5 rating from everyone.  Just listen to the album, you won't be disappointed.  I mean, if you like the Beatles, you'll love this album.  If you don't like them, then you aren't missing anything, just skip it.  I would have given this a 6/5 rating except for one song:  The Song about the Sun.  It could've been better, but the band put out the album in the hopes that it would be popular to other fans of the band.  I hate to say it, but I am a little disappointed.  I'm not expecting them to be good, but I expected them to be better than this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Hey guys, you gotta give it a shot.  I'll tell you why:  This is the first album I've ever bought from the band.  I had heard some good reviews on the band and I just decided to give it a shot.  Even though I could tell that they put out a good album, I just could not bring myself to listen to the whole album.  I thought it would be interesting to hear it with the rest of the band, but I was just so tired of hearing the same old thing every other song.  I don't know what it is, but I just can't listen to this CD.  I don't even want to listen to this CD.  
I don't know if I could put the CD down.  I just don't have enough patience for this CD.  I don't have time for this CD.  The whole CD is like two hours and I just can't wait to get to the end.  It's just like I was listening to a CD somebody else recorded and then I was just bored with it.  I don't even know how I'm going to get through this CD.  I don't even know how I'm going to listen to this CD.  I just have to get through it because I don't know if I'll have any time left to listen to any other CD.  I don't like this CD.  I'm not sure I can put the CD down.  I don't know why I'm telling you guys this.  Honestly, I don't even know if I want to hear whatever this CD is.  I just don't have enough patience for this CD.  
I don't know what's happening to me.  I feel like I've been doing this for years.  I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.  I've been like this for years.  I've been stuck doing things that are just annoying to me.  I don't even know why I'm telling you

Danzig (pronounced like the German word for "witch") is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1972 by guitarist and singer, Dave Mustaine. The band is named for the character in John F. Kennedy's book, Profiles in Courage, who was nicknamed the "Danzig Witch".
The band has released five full-length albums, with the first three being The Great American Ballad: The Best of Danzig in 1976, the band's debut; Bad Touch: Blood on the Tracks in 1980, which was certified gold in the US and went double platinum in the UK, and the band's second album, The Accused: A Tribute to AC/DC in 1984

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A couple of songs on this CD are not for me.  The two songs that I did not like are:  "When I See You" and "My God I Love You."  The music is nice but the singing is poor.  On the other hand, I enjoyed the following two songs:  "A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square" and "Crown and Sceptre."  The music is very beautiful and would make a nice addition to a choral/orchestra CD.  The songs are well sung and very beautiful.    I have heard that the album is not as well recorded as other albums by this talented artist.  When I compare this CD to the previous Libera album I thought the album was better and the singing was better.  The instrumentation is also better.  Overall, I thought this CD was a very good album and I hope Libera continues to record.

Amazon review: I purchased this disc because of the composer's name.  I thought it would be a good idea to have such a disc on hand to listen to for those who are not familiar with this composer.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just discovered this composer when I saw his name on Amazon.  I have bought his previous works and had not realized that he was a composer.  His works are very well written and his choral works are very beautiful.  The only thing I would change about this CD is that I would like to hear more of his choral works.  I am sure that he is good and can write much better choral works, but they seem to be few and far between.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting album.  The songs are very well written and the instrumentalists sing very well.  All in all, a very high quality CD.  

This is the first time I have heard Libera Di Capri's music.  I had heard the name and knew what the album was about, but I had not listened to it.  This album brought me back to my youth in the 70's.  It was the early days of the hippie movement and everything was new and exciting.  I remember this album as being the first in a long line of albums that I listened to as a child.  I really enjoyed this album.  A few of his other albums have been re-issued on CD and I have listened to them and they are all very interesting.  I hope there is a follow up to this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first of the Libera albums that I have heard.  I have listened to them all and I like the music.  This one is a little less interesting.  That doesn't mean it is bad, but that it is not my favorite.  The only thing that really holds me back from buying this album is that I am not familiar with the composer.  I have listened to the other albums by Libera and they have all been excellent.  This is a very fine album.

Amazon review: It took me forever to write this review, but I have enjoyed this album.  I think this is one of the best Libera albums that I have ever heard.

Sentiment: Positive

My daughter started listening to this album about a year ago and she now asks me to play it over and over again. It's just so soothing and relaxing at the same time.

From Amazon:

"From the classic to contemporary and everything in between, this album features music from the past, present and future of the classical genre. Each track is an original composition and one of the most requested classical albums of all time. This new release provides a different listening experience for classical music fans. Enjoy this relaxing collection of classical music.

"When the record label found my voice in "Aquaphone" and asked me to record a new classical album, I wasn't prepared for what to expect. I had to take a step back and listen to my own music to make sure it was what I wanted to do. I was fortunate enough to meet two brilliant and talented musicians who both have different musical backgrounds. They taught me how to record my voice and then how to bring it to life with their music. We used a variety of studio equipment to create this album. The result is a sound that is rich and diverse. It has the warmth of a full orchestra, the soul of a choir and the power of a live recording. This album is perfect for a romantic night, a family gathering, a quiet retreat or just to relax after a busy day."

"The album is not only beautiful to listen to, but it is also very relaxing to listen to. The lyrics are very appropriate for the different moods and they help create a peaceful atmosphere. The music is very unique and has a lot of variety. You will be able to find something for yourself that you like and that will help you get through a difficult time. So I would recommend this album to anyone who needs a soothing soundtrack for a relaxing evening."

-Samanth

"Great album. This is another well-priced classical album that will make you feel good and calm. The album has beautiful melodies and the songs are not repetitive. This is also one of the best classical albums I have ever heard."

"This album has a great combination of relaxing music and classical music. It's music for relaxing, or for listening to while you are in bed, or for relaxing on the beach. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys classical music."

-Bobby

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I'm not even sure what I expected. On the other hand, I love the album. I love the lyrics. I love the way the music is mixed, and the vocals.

Our church has a choir that meets every Sunday and is mostly a group of men and women who sing together.  When her son sang, he had a good voice and could really belt the notes.  I tried to sing with him, but I didn't do much.  I found it hard to breathe and my voice kept going up and down.  The song I chose didn't have a good part either.  I think it was the song for the people who had to go to the hospital with her.  I really need to learn a few songs for the right occasion.

I have been singing for 10 years and I have never heard a CD of this quality.

Amazon review: This CD is a must have.  My choir teacher was trying to get another CD from the library, but I talked her out of it. What a blessing to be able to listen to this one piece of music.  It is not easy to sing, but this CD is a blessing.  This is one of my favorite pieces of music of all time. I used to be able to sing really well, but it had become a habit to be able to sing like a choir or a church choir, but not a normal voice.  I am glad that I can at least sing for the people I meet in the church.
