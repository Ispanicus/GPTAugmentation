Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I purchased this song from the CD a little too soon. I had heard it earlier and thought it was something special. I was still in shock when I heard it on the radio. I don't think it's a very good song, but I am not completely sure, because it's so hard for me to believe. It's not even clear what song it is from.

Amazon review: Oh no! I'm late for a party.  I need to turn off my brain and relax. I need a good song to listen to instead of this depressing music.  It's not that I don't love the song, but it just sounds like a bunch of other songs I've heard before.  This is the best I can do for now.

Amazon review: I really love this song.  It is the first time I have heard a song with these lyrics, and it really resonates with me. I have found this song on YouTube and I have been listening to it quite a lot. I just started a new job and I have been taking my computer with me to work so I can listen to music while I work. I really like the song and it really makes me feel better about the changes in my life.

Amazon review: The song is good, but I am a little disappointed as there is a lot of noise on the CD.  I have been listening to it for quite some time and it still sounds the same.

Amazon review: This song is a total ripoff of the original Hallelujah.  I think the best thing about the song is the lyrics, which are very powerful.  The guitar is great and the song is very powerful and has a great feeling in it.  I love the song and the lyrics and I hope that the people who are responsible for this song don't rip it off.  I have been listening to this song very frequently.  I am glad I bought the CD, but I don't think I will buy the CD again.

Amazon review: This song is the only song on the album that my kids actually know.  We have played this song in church and they have listened to it, but they do not know the lyrics.  It is a really good song, and it is also the only song on the album that is appropriate for my wife and myself to listen to when we are driving.  I think that, with this song and the album, it is important for me to share this with others because it is a powerful song that is very meaningful to me.

Amazon review: This song was one of the best songs I have heard this year.  I bought the CD because it was on the radio and I thought it was excellent.  I was in shock when I first heard it, but now, it is one of the most wonderful songs I have ever heard.  I am not sure why I am not enjoying the song as much as I am enjoying the CD.  I think it is because I am listening to it in a different way.  I don't usually listen to the radio, so I am sure that it is just getting overplayed.  It is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I have been listening to it frequently, and I think that I will be buying the CD again.

Amazon review by: Robert S., Nov 9, 2014 I love this song and I have been listening to it quite a bit.  The lyrics are very powerful.

Amazon review: This song really got under my skin, but it is a good song.  I usually hate songs that are too repetitive, but this one works for me, because it is the song about the worship that you do in the church.  I have listened to this song a couple of times and it really makes me feel better.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This album is a compilation of some of the worst songs in the world, and they are all here.  I don't like to hear ANY of his songs played by anyone else.  There are a few that stick out like a sore thumb, but his worst songs are still there.  They are very generic, and are just not very good.  I can't help but think that he did this to get his name out there for people to buy his music.  I can't bring myself to listen to his music.  But I'll listen to a few of his songs here and there, just to see what kind of garbage he has put out.

It is not a digital download or a video."  It also says, "This product is not for sale" and, "Do you want to buy this product?"  But I don't want to buy this product, because it doesn't sound like a CD.  It sounds like it is a bad CD.  The songs just don't sound like they should.

I have never liked them and I have heard them on the radio more than once.  They are all that I have ever liked.  They did make me laugh and  cry and I thought about things I never thought before.  I also like  Paul Cauthen.  I have never liked him either.  I'm not a huge fan of jazz but I can't listen to these guys anymore.             

Review: I am a die hard Jazz fan.  I love this music.  All the music I listen to is Jazz.  I started listening to Jazz when I was 5 years old.  I fell in love with this genre and have been hooked ever since.  I love the music, the lyrics and the message on all the music I listen to.  I love it all.  The songs were a little different on the CD.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I hope she does a whole new album in the future with new music.  I will still listen to her because she is a wonderful artist.  I will still listen to "I'm Not Dead" because I like it.

This is a hard album to listen to because I'm in a depression and I listen to the music and I think that I'm going to go insane. I read a post on a website about suicide and that made me feel much better.

I've been through a lot in my life. I've been married to my husband for over 20 years. We had a son who died at the age of 3. I was married to a man who was a very violent man and I was left the worst nightmare for the next 18 years. I've had a very hard time with my family. I've had to lose my husband at the age of 50 and my son. I have been physically and mentally abused. I've had hard times but I'm still here and I get up everyday no matter what. This album is hard for me because I'm feeling the pain.

I have been through much in my life but I don't feel alone. I have friends that are here with me and I really want to be here for them but I don't know where to start.

My son was named "Jacob" after my late husband and his name is now "Michael" which is a name that he will never have.

I hope that you have a good day.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: No se habla espanol y no se puede escribir una buena canción de amor.  Este disco no es nada mas!  Thalia tiene una voz que solo puede ser interpretada por una mujer con mucho coraje.  El amor es muy difícil para una mujer y este disco es una muestra para ella.  No se puede escribir una buena canción.  Algo raro y sin una chica es una canción que en verdad no habra de ser.  Son unos tíos en las canciones.

Thalia no es una mujer de gran talento para cantar.  Solo puede ser interpretada por una mujer de fuera.  Esta canción siente muy poco de la muerte.  En mi opinio de amigos, es una canción para el amor.  La canción no es nada mas pero esa no es para amor.  Los cachorros son una canción.  Una canción de mierda.  Una canción de mierda y quien sabe si no se va a cambiar.  Si se cambia alguno de los otros tres, sera cambiar.  Esta canción esta de la muerte, parece que dejaste tu boda y dejaste de querer cambiar.  Esta canción no es para estar enamorada.  Y es una canción de mierda.  Debe de estar cagado de la muerte.  Debe de estar cagado de la muerdea.  Debe de estar cagado con la muerte y esta canción no es para amor.  Debe de estar cagado con la muerdea y esta canción no es para amor.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I'm really not feeling the new Twiztid album.  I love Aerosmith, but my first thought was that I would be really excited about there new album.  The last album I liked was their last one which came out a while ago.  This album just seems like a complete waste of money and a waste of talent.  I'll probably wait and see what comes out of the mainstream for the next Aerosmith album.  I'm sure when it does come out I will be happy, but I will probably wait.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Lyrics are good.  The song is good to listen to.  But, to me, the production is not what I expected from a pop song.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a very good CD that I highly recommend. I did not purchase this for singing but for other purposes. I listened to the first four tracks on the CD and decided to purchase it. The songs were upbeat and had a lot of energy. The best songs were the ones that had a good beat. I am not a fan of overly upbeat music. I don't want any "bum bum bum" songs. The music is simple, easy to listen to and easy to sing along to. I highly recommend this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I have been playing it for over 5 years and still love the music.  One song is on the radio and one song has been added to the radio, and they both rock.

Amazon review: I had to listen to this album twice as I was enjoying it, but I like the new style and feel of it better than the old style.  I was amazed at how much more "real" it sounded.  The songs are just longer and more focused and the rapping is more natural.  Not to mention the new drummer.  He is a nice addition.

Amazon review: This is not the most amazing CD but it's definitely the most underrated.  I heard a lot of bad press for this album from fans, but I don't agree.  It's still one of my favorites by them.  The songs are well written and the lyrics on the songs are great.  I even like the drumming.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I saw it on Amazon, and I was just blown away by the quality of the tracks.  I am used to playing the records I bought from the radio and now I have to listen to the music I have to buy from the internet.  I have to agree with the general opinion that this album is as good as the previous album.  I have to say that I also miss the old albums, but I cannot compare them to the new album.  I have to give credit to the group for their excellent work, but I cannot say that I am truly satisfied.

Amazon review: I just got Twiztid's record for Christmas.  This is my first CD by the band, and I am very excited to share it with my family and friends.  I've never gotten a record from a band I hadn't heard, and I am glad I did.  The songs are catchy, and the rapping is great.  I just wish the CD came with the lyrics and the music on it, but it does, in the case of the first song, which is a radio-friendly version of "Blowin' in the Wind."  The lyrics are on the back of the CD.  I'll take the CD without the lyrics, though, as I'm not a fan of the lyrics anyway.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I saw it at a mall kiosk.  I saw a lot of people that had the same opinion (I was lucky enough to be one of the only people that didn't).  It has been on the radio a lot, but it did not really catch my ear.  I will give it another chance when I get home.  The songs are very catchy.

Amazon review: I bought a CD of Twiztid's Christmas album for Christmas.  I was not sure I would like it, but I have to say this is my favorite CD of theirs.  I am a big fan of the way they arrange their instruments.  The songs are very catchy and the rapping is very good.  I just wish they would make more CDs with different styles.  I think they'd sell a lot better.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by the first song.  It was on the radio the first time I heard it, and I was sure I was going to hate it, but I listened to it again and again and again and got into it.  I am very surprised by the new songs.  They are just as good as the old songs.  The lyrics and rapping are better on the new songs.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This song is a great example of what this artist can do.  The beat and drums are what make this song a "hit"  The voice  is very smooth and easy to listen to.  The vocals bring you into the song.  The lyrics make it even more impressive.  This song is one of the best  on the album.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  I just wanted to hear Celine Dion sing.  Well, what I got was a Celine Dion song and a Celine Dion voice.  She sang one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  She was the same on her CD 'My Destiny' as she was on 'The Colour of My Love' and 'A New Day'.  She is a great singer but I don't think she is a great singer.  I also heard the same song sung by a guy who also sang the same song.  When I go to a concert I want to see the artist.  I don't want to hear a bunch of other artists who are not the artist.  The artist should be the one who is the best.  I think the singer who sang 'My Destiny' was the worst singer I have ever heard.  The rest of the album was all the same.  Celine Dion was no better.  She just had a voice that is much better than any other singer.  She should sing her songs like that.  She should sing her songs with more emotion and less attitude.  She should sing her songs like she wrote them.
