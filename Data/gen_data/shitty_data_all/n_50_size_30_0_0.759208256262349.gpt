Amazon review: Great song for Meditation.  I have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day, so I like the calm music of this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I've never been a big fan of this band, but I do know that they have an amazing sound.  I bought this album on  Ebay and have been playing it over and over.  If you are a fan of a folk rock band,  this is probably not for you.  I'm a fan of a few others in this genre, but this band just doesn't appeal to me.  They have a lot of talent, but I find their music a little too simple.  There is no real message or message to be extracted from these songs.  I understand that they are trying to be a folk band, but it just doesn't come across to me.  I think they are trying too hard.  They're trying to be a more "popular" band with less talent.  But I still like them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't listened to a single album by this band in about twenty years.  I bought this CD during the first release in  1997 to check out what they were doing.  I didn't like it, and I've never listened to it since.  They are from the same country of  Germany and have a similar style, but I find their music to be cheesy.  I don't like their music.  At the  end of the album, they do have a good song,  but they don't sing it well.

Amazon review: I got this album recently, and I've been playing it over and over.  I've been listening to the second album  quite a lot.  It's a real nice recording, but I don't want to spend too much time on it.  I like the songs, but I think it's just too cheesy.

Amazon review:  I have never heard of this band before, but I have a friend who loves them so I listened to their first album to hear if I could find something I liked.  I found it.  I was kind of disappointed that it sounded nothing like the first album, but I still liked it.  I guess I am a little too young to appreciate it.  I have only listened to the second album.  I think it is good, but I don't want to get into the second album just yet.  I will in a couple of years.

Amazon review:  I got this album the first time around to give it a spin.  I didn't like it.  But I was wrong.  I have been playing it over and over.  I thought it was a decent album, but I have heard better.  The music is pretty much the same, but there are a few new songs, and it is really well done.  There isn't a lot of talent on this album.  It's the kind of album that you buy, play, and forget about.  I guess they are trying to be a "pop" band.  The music is cheesy, but it is a decent album.  The lyrics are nice, but there isn't much of a message.  I understand it is only a "pop" band, but it is not something I can sit down and listen to for an hour and not get bored.  I don't know how to say this any better than I did.  This is the kind of album that you play, and you play it over and over.  I can hear the songs and the music, but I can't help but feel like there is  something missing.  Maybe it is the same song over and over.  Maybe it is the same song, but the lyrics are different on each record.  I don't know.  I just can't help but feel like there is a message, but it isn't one I can extract from this album.  If I could, I would never listen to this again.  I will get a few others, but this one is just not for me.

It sounds like there is something missing.  The instruments themselves are OK, but the vocals are just too much.  I can't relate to any of the songs.  There is nothing I can say.  This album is so simplistic that I can't help but feel like there is something missing.  I can listen to it over and over and not get bored.  I need a little

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know Jewel was a pop singer, and had this great voice...and I am sure it was good. But, she never really sang folk songs. She sang what she wanted to sing. She was good at what she did. And with her music, she did not really have a voice. So, what did she do? She became a television actress, which is a fine thing. I'm glad she did it. It is what she needed to do, and she made it. And for that I am grateful. Thank you, Jewel.

I hope to be able to find the CD for sale at the grocery store. I have been listening to this CD for the past hour now and I am very happy with it. I am very happy to support her, and I believe that she is a great artist. I hope that I will be able to add this CD to my collection with my hard won money that I received through my school.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to get my copy of this CD from my friend, who is a professional musician and also a musician teacher (for the last 25 years).  The CDs are beautiful.  They are very well produced and the sound is excellent.  The songs are very well written, but I found that there were two songs in particular that I didn't like very much.  I like the songs that are good, but I think that there are some that are not very good.  I think the reason I didn't like two of them (I didn't hear them a lot) is that I didn't hear them a lot.  Sometimes in a concert, the singer can go through a lot of songs in a row without really making it known that he/she has heard them! The same thing happened to me.  I like most of the songs, but the two I did not like were "Piece of Cake" and "Don't Call Me a Liar".  I have to admit that I am not a big fan of Danzig's music.  I have always thought that it was all a bit cheesy.  I guess I'm just not a big fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this CD for myself, for my sister.  I listened to the songs a lot and she really enjoyed them.  She loves the singing and the lyrics are very meaningful. I am very surprised that I have not bought a CD with a song that is not by Danzig.  I am not disappointed.  It is worth the money if you like songs like "The Sound of Silence" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit".  I am giving it 5 stars because it is my opinion that the singer is really good.  I don't think that the recording is as great as the songs are!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is about the importance of "listening to your heart" and what it means to "be yourself".  The first part is very good and I really like the chorus.  I liked the song, but the rest of the song was not very enjoyable.  The recording is so bad, that it is hard to even listen to the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked this CD because of the sound quality.  The CD is very good quality.  I am not sure how much better the sound quality would be, if I listened to this in a smaller studio.  But the sound quality is excellent, and the music is very good.

Amazon review: I have listened to a lot of Danzig's songs, but this is my favorite.  I love the songs because they are very well written, but the lyrics are very meaningful and the vocalist is a very good singer.  I listened to some of the songs a lot when I was in college, so I have a good sense of what it is like to hear lyrics, that are meaningful and that you really like.  The lyrics on this CD are very meaningful and they are the reason I have bought this CD.  I am giving it 5 stars because it is my opinion that the listener is going to love this CD.

Amazon review: I am listening to "In the Meantime" by Danzig at the moment.  I have never heard anything like it before.  It is very beautiful, but at the same time very intense.  The song is very important to me.  I like it because I feel like I have lost a very dear person in my life.  But I have to admit that it's a very sad song and I do feel that there are some lyrics that are quite disturbing.  I think that the lyrics are very important and the song is very important to many people.  I think that it is important to do something about the song.  The song can be heard by many people and I think that it is important to do something about it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  I listened to the CD the other day and I was surprised at some of the lyrics.  It seems that the author of this CD is a little too preachy.  I think the author has a little bit too much time on his hands.  I think the lyrics are nice and have a nice message.  I do not know if someone else has told you about this, but I enjoy the words of the Bible.  I think I could have gotten a lot more out of the CD if I had read the Bible.  I also think the book is pretty boring.  I don't like the concept of the CD.  I do not like to hear religious songs.  I do not like to hear music that is about faith.  I am not a religious person.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is not as good as the first one, but it still contains a lot of good songs. The first album was a great album, however, I think the songs on this album are a little more interesting. I think the songs on the second album are a little redundant. The first one was very creative, and I think their second album is just as good as their first one, it's just a little more bland. I don't know if it is a result of the band not using a producer, or not using the same producer as their first album. I'm sure it is a combination of both. Overall, I still like this album, and I think it will be a great album for them to sell on their own.

Amazon review: I saw the band when they were on tour in the mid-90s, and I was surprised to see them live. I thought they were a little old for that band, but when they started playing they were like real teenagers, with a sound that was similar to the bands they were copying. The band was really tight and the songs were well paced, but they just wore out. I saw them again in 2004, and I was really surprised this time to see them as they had grown up. They were still tight, but they were more grown up than the band I saw in the mid-90s. They seemed to be a much more serious band. They played a style I didn't expect from them. They played a lot of blues and rock, but their songs were more complex and they had a lot of energy. I think they are still a good live band, as I have seen them again, but they don't seem like they are as tight as they were when I saw them with the band in the mid-90s.

Amazon review: I was really surprised to see that after the 1st cd came out, the band had changed so much. I wasn't expecting anything different. I was very disappointed when I saw them. They looked different, they sounded different, and they sounded more like the people they are now. They didn't sound anything like the band on the cd. It was a great band, but they just got boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band. The first time I saw them was when they were at the U of I. They looked like a punk rock band, but they played just like a rock and roll band. They played some of the greatest old school rock and roll, and they were very tight. They were the most creative band I have ever seen. They had a way of playing that reminded me of a band I used to see in college. I saw them again in 2004 at the U of I. They were still great, but the songs they played were very boring. Their guitar tone was just boring. I also saw them at a wedding, and their band was even better. The songs on this cd were more interesting than their last cd. The songs were more short and they could play the words better. The lyrics were better, and the music had more energy. They were still great, just more so.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have heard so many good songs from this band. I would like to say the band is great and a must-see when in college. However, after hearing so many great songs, I found that they were not great. They were actually pretty boring. I wouldn't want to be in the same room with them. I would say they're pretty good at playing the blues, and I'm glad for that, but they just can't sing very well. They do have a good sound, but they just don't have the talent to write truly great songs.

Amazon review: This album is a definite step down from the first two, but it still has a lot of good songs. I think the songs on this album are a little more interesting. I also think the songs on the second album are a little more redundant. The first one was a great album, but the songs on the second album were a little too similar. I think this album is a step up from the first one and it has a little more variety. Overall, I still like this album, but it's not as good as the first.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think the band has changed a lot since the first album. There is no way I could play the 1st album with any of the members of this band.

For me, the only reason why I would buy this band

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This was a CD that I expected to be horrible. I had heard nothing but bad reviews from others about it. I thought that it would be nothing but negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised with the disc. The sound quality is better than the last time I listened to this CD and the singing was much better. It was very well produced and I was pleased with the sound quality.  I am not a fan of the genre of folk music but I would like to see her return to this one. I was disappointed with the songs and was not impressed with the music. I would not have wanted to listen to this CD again. Although, it was not awful, I thought it was a bit too much for the price. I would not recommend it but would not put my money down for good. Its worth a listen but would be better if she were to sing more country or gospel music.  (I will say that I was quite impressed with the vocals by the lead singer.)  Overall, a very good album with many good songs. I am glad that she is back. Don't listen to this CD unless you want to hear how a little girl dies.

I immediately began to look for the album inside (which is not the first time I've done this), and thought about purchasing it. The album turned out to be just what I was looking for. I was attracted to the title of the album because I've been a believer in Christ for a year now. I've been struggling with doubt and indecision on a daily basis with regards to my faith. Through the teachings in the album, I've been able to find strength and resolve in my faith to follow Jesus Christ. The lessons in the album are well thought out and easy to understand. They help me to grow spiritually and to follow Jesus Christ, even when the going gets difficult.

Amazon review: Great song for Meditation.  I have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day, so I like the calm music of this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have this album on CD and the CD is from a year ago.  I love the vocals by this singer/songwriter. She is very talented and her music is just amazing.  I don't know why they are re-releasing their albums on CD.  They've been doing this since the beginning.  The CD is good and I have enjoyed it.  I do have a couple of issues, though.  First, the music is very repetitive.  It is like the same songs over and over again.  Second, the lyrics are pretty generic.  For example, the words, "I'd love to say this is the saddest thing in the world," don't really have the right context.  The lyrics are generic and not very inspiring.  I've purchased the CD and intend to purchase the DVD when it is released.  I love this singer/songwriter.  I wish she would release a DVD with her music.  She is just too good for me to have to search for her music.  I just hope she releases a DVD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a compilation CD by a band called, I Heart Brooklyn.  This CD includes three songs, "Boom Boom Boom," "Good Night," and "In My Head."  While the songs themselves are really good, the CD doesn't have much value to me.  The songs are good and the music is good.  However, the music is not special.  You can find the songs on the Internet or you can buy them from a CD store.  The songs were recorded and are just as good as the songs featured on the CD.  The music is generic and the CD is a waste of money.  For those who like the band, this is a great record.  However for those who don't like the band, this is not a good record.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band.  I have purchased and listened to this album on CD twice.  The music is so unique and the lyrics are so meaningful.  I love this band and I believe this is one of the most beautiful, heartfelt, and inspiring albums of the last 10 years.  I hope they continue to do great music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have two problems with this album.  1. The music is generic.  Even the songs the band is not from America.  The songs are just generic.  2. The CD is boring.  The songs are not great.  I'm not saying every song is bad, but they aren't great either.  I like this band, but I don't think they are that great.  The songs just don't have a lot of energy and their lyrics are not that good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band ever since they released their first CD.  I bought the CD once for myself and then went on to buy the band's first three albums.  I love the music of this band.  I've never owned a CD of the band, but I would like to have them in my collection.  I don't know why they don't release their albums on CD, but I hope they do.  They are great and the music is great.  I'm not gonna lie, I love the music.  The lyrics are very meaningful and the music is so beautiful.  I'm not gonna lie, I am also not a huge fan of the band.  I understand they are young, but I hope they continue to be great.

Amazon review: I have been buying their albums since their first CD came out.  The music is great, but the lyrics are not.  I do love them, but the lyrics are not that great.

I hope they release more albums by this band.  I do like the music, but the lyrics are not that good.  I hope they continue to be great.

Amazon review: I'm still waiting for the day to come when I buy the new album, or even if I wait until it is out on CD. However, I was pleasantly reminded of the fact that, even though my wife and I are not huge fans of blues, we have yet to find a blues album we don't like. I guess that's the way it goes, if you don't like it, you can't force yourself to like it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: The CD is great!  It's the same mix of western swing and classical swing you've heard on all the earlier CDs.  My only complaint is that the CD is a bit short.

I understand the CDs have been replaced by the same CDs being offered at a discount, but you can't keep a good product for free.

Amazon review: I like Ray Benson's western swing CDs, but I don't believe that you can learn to play guitar with just one CD.  I learned to play guitar with just one CD and I learned very quickly that you need more than one CD in order to learn to play the guitar.  That is why the best CDs are the ones with all the instruments, like Ray Benson's "Classical Swing."

Amazon review: I bought this CD after hearing about Ray Benson and the quality of his music.  What I heard was not only an excellent CD, but a good CD, good quality, and good sounding.  Ray Benson's western swing music is a breath of fresh air.  This CD will be my last purchase from Amazon.com.  I will never buy anything from this company again.  I expect the quality of the information on-line to be the same as in stores or the same as in the stores I go to.  If you have never ordered anything from Amazon.com, you will be surprised how bad the "Experience" for ordering anything from Amazon.com.  I had to change my order several times because of all the problems.  If you want to order anything from Amazon.com, get someone else to do it for you.  I have never been given any information at all about getting my stuff back.  You are not the only one who had to do this.  I have had to contact the customer service department several times, they are not even in the store.  I want to buy from Ray Benson.  I have ordered several of his CDs and have been very satisfied with each.  If you want to hear a CD you can't do without, buy this CD.  I am a very satisfied customer, and I have been in touch with Ray Benson several times.  I have made several long distance calls to him as well, he's my favorite singer.  I hope that you will buy Ray's CDs, and I hope to hear some of them on the radio.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
