Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have been using my Sony PCM-CD-2 CD player for several years and have always been satisfied with its performance. Recently, however, I decided to purchase an audio CD player to replace it. I purchased a Sony PCM-HCD-D500 CD player with the intentions of playing music and listening to podcasts. After a week of owning the player, I realized that there was a very noticeable difference between the sound quality of the two players. I decided to upgrade to the HCD player, but while I was waiting for delivery I decided to look online for other players and discovered X-Fi CD Player CD-D500. This player sounded great to me, but it was not available in any of my local stores.
I purchased the player in two different sizes: small (I use it in the car) and large (I use the player in my home) to determine which would be more appropriate for my needs. After reading many reviews on the subject, I decided to go with the smaller player and I was surprised to find that it was the perfect size for my needs. I was very pleased with the unit and I was able to play music and podcasts without any problems with it. I was surprised to find that the player felt very sturdy and had a nice weight to it.
I have only had the unit for a month or so, but I have already noticed that the audio quality is very good and that the player has a very nice and clean sound. I am very happy with the purchase and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an audio CD player.

Amazon review: I feel like I've died and gone to heaven, thank you so much for this product. It's taken me from the depths of hell to the highest pinnacle of bliss and I truly can't thank you enough.
I'm a huge audiophile and I've tried a lot of different CD players in the past and this is hands down the best CD player I've ever listened to. There is just something about CD players, especially those with 5.1 surround sound that makes it so much easier to take it to a concert.
I would recommend this product to anyone, but with the caveat that it's got to be a good player, and not a bargain basement garbage piece of crap.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the original Hair CD (as well as the original Broadway musical), but I am also a fan of the 2009 production.  I am not sure of the exact reason, but I believe the production is missing something in the 2009 version.  The 2009 version is great.  The vocals are much improved, and I feel that the song selections have been better chosen.  It is missing the energy, the excitement, the rambunctiousness that I felt in the original.  If you like the original, you will like the 2009 version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a huge hair fan and have been listening for years.  I've read a lot of reviews of this album, and I must admit, I've enjoyed it.  The music is very good, the lyrics are a tad off-key, but the production is great.  I've been listening to it on repeat since the first time I read the book, and I feel like I'm getting older.  The first time I listened to it, I heard songs by artists like Donna Summer, The Beach Boys, and Rod Stewart.  I even bought the Donna Summer CD for my friends and family to share with them.  I love it, but I like it more when I listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the original Hair, but I love this version even more.  It may sound like the original is overplayed, but I feel like the original is still much better than this one.  I've listened to it at least 20 times and have not found any songs that I like better.  I'm not a big fan of "The Broadway Sound" (I'm a Tony-winning actor), but I do like the more current version and the music by Rufus Wainwright and The Roots.  I love the use of the "Beat Club" concept with this version, and I love the way Liza Minnelli is a huge part of it.  I've written about the musical in the past, so I'll just say that I like the song selections more.  I also like the production (although I don't love the costumes and the stage), and I like that there is a little more variety in the song selections.  I'm not the kind of person that listens to the originals every day, but I do like to listen to them and make my own comparisons.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is the best original production of the Hair musical.  There are a few songs that are a little rough, but I like the overall musicality of the album.  I believe that Liza Minnelli has the best singing in the original, and she is great in the original production, too.  The lyrics are a little off-key, but I wouldn't put this album down.  I would definitely recommend this production to fans of the original and of the show.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I find the 2009 version to be a little overplayed.  I think it's hard to listen to the original without being bothered by some of the lyrics.

I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album!  I have a hard time deciding which song is my favorite.  Even though it's not the most polished production, I love it.  I love that the vocals are improved, and I think the song selections are a little better than the original.  The production is great.  I don't understand why some people seem to like it more than the original, though.  I think it has some flaws, but I love it anyway.

Amazon review: I love both versions of this album.  They both sound great.  I'm not a huge fan of the originals, but I love this production.  It's different and unique.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: A great selection of Christmas tunes that would be a great fit for your Christmas album.  Most of the songs are very well done.  The only thing is that there are a few songs that are not as well done as others.  This is not the best compilation of Christmas songs I've ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is one of the best ones I've ever heard, although I've heard almost all of them.  The only thing I do not like is that there are so many versions of the same song.  For example, there are 7 versions of "Away in a Manger".  I like my version, but I can't really say what they might have done with the others.  There are other versions of the same song, so there is no way to tell if they changed the arrangement or not.  The only songs that are really similar are "Christmas Time" and "Away in a Manger", so I can only assume that the ones that are not very similar are the ones that weren't played live.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very enjoyable Christmas album.  Most of the songs are very well done.  There are a few songs that are not as good as others.

Sentiment: Negative

This is a fine disc.  No complaints.  I like the title track, "Away in a Manger".  I had heard it before and thought that it would be a nice song to have on my Christmas album.  It's a beautiful ballad.  I never saw much of it perform live, but I like the arrangement and the lyrics.  I hope I can find time to hear it better in the future.  The album seems to be more about the music than the words.  I thought that the lyrics were pretty good and the melodies were good, but I did not like this album.  It has good songs, but they don't have a Christmas feeling to them.

I like the music.

First of all, I am a huge fan of Kris Kross.  I've been a fan of their music since the days of the "Babies From Mars" tour.  I've been to concerts of them in the past and I really enjoy their music.  I've bought their CDs, have listened to them on the radio and have listened to them on the radio.  I'm a huge fan and I do not want to see them go away.  I don't think they need to get a new disc.  I'm a fan, but I don't think that they need to get a new disc.  They'll just need to find someone who is a fan to represent them.  They need to find someone who can sing and play the guitar and the keyboard and all the other instruments.  It isn't that hard.  I can't see them going away.  They are just not that big.

Second of all, I really like this album.  It's a lovely album.  I really like the title track, "Away in a Manger".  It's a lovely ballad.  I don't know what they did with the rest of the songs.  I don't think that they need to get a new album.  They'll just need to find someone who is a fan to play them at their next concert.

Third of all, this album is a very good album.  I like the title track, "Away in a Mangement".  I had heard it before and thought that it would be a lovely song to have on my Christmas album.  It's a lovely ballart.  I don't know what they did with the rest of the song.  I don't think that they need to get a new album or a new CD.  They'll just need to find someone who is a fan to perform them at their next concert.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

It's not overly-produced, like some of the other albums I've reviewed, but it's not extremely well-produced either.  There are a few songs that are out of place, like "I Can't Believe You" and "Trouble" and "Love Is a Highway".

Bitch Song

Hey, there!
It's me again!  I'm back.  I've been having a lot of fun here on the internet this week!  I've been reading a lot, and have been writing poetry, and have been thinking a lot.  I went to see the film A Dog's Purpose with my mom and it was awesome.  I love that movie.  It's just a really good movie.  I mean I don't know how, but I enjoyed it.  I love the way they make the movie sound like a love song.  I like that.  It's very creative.
I'm also excited to say that my new book is officially out!  It's called "In the Shadow of Love" and it's actually a collection of poetry.  It's a collection of poems about love.  You should really check it out.  It's available on Amazon.  It's called "In the Shadow of Love".  I'm really excited for it.  I'm going to start reading it today.  It's going to be fun.  It's going to be good.  It's going to be really good.  I'm really excited for it.  I'm really happy.  It's going to be awesome.  It's going to be so awesome.
Anyway, I hope you all have had a great week.  It's going to be a great week.  It's going to be a great week.
I love you guys.  And this blog is going to be the best blog ever.  It's going to be so awesome.
I love you.  I love you.  Bye for now.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A lot of Pink Floyd fans will be happy with this one, but I'm not a fan of the Floyd.  From what I have heard, I'm not a fan at all.  It's okay, but it doesn't do justice to the Floyd.  I listened to the whole album in one sitting, and I left feeling like I'd heard more of the same in the same amount of time that I had listened to the other songs on it.  I think at the very least it's good for those who like Pink Floyd, but, by no means, a keeper.  The songs are very similar to the ones on the "Meddle" and "Another Brick in the Wall" albums, just with a more mellow tone.  If you liked those albums, you'll probably like this one.  Otherwise, it's just filler.  The production, while a little bit better than the tracks from the "Meddle" and "Another Brick in the Wall" releases, is just about the same as it was on the "Paint" and "The Wall" albums.  If you liked those albums, you will probably like this one.  If not, well then, you won't.  There are some great songs on here, but they're just not the kind of material I'd choose to listen to or listen to repeatedly.  The album has a solid 9.7 rating on Amazon, so it's not exactly a sure-fire keeper, but it's definitely worth a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like some of the tracks on this album, but I don't think this album is worth the money.  I'll say this, though; I think it is great.  It has some really cool drumming on the record.  It's only okay for a one or two song break, but it's good enough for me to buy.  I really like the guitar work on this.  I like the sound of the guitars, and I like the feel of the guitar work.  I don't think that there are any filler tracks here.  The songs are all solid.  I just wish that the vocals were better.  The vocals on these songs are actually on par with the vocals on the other songs on this album.  The vocals on the other songs are what I would consider to be "gimmicky".  On some of the other songs, the vocals are a little better.  I'll give this a 7.5/10.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a perfect mix of what I like in music and what I don't like in music.  I like pop music, so I think this is a good listen for those that enjoy pop music.  I've listened to a couple of songs on this and I get what they're trying to do.  It's good.  I don't like it, though.  I just don't.  I'll say, though, that there are a couple of songs on here that I don't get.  It's not bad music, but it's not good music.  Other than that, it's a 5 star album for me.  This is a solid album, but I don't think that it's worth the money.  I don't mind buying this one, but I just don't think it's worth the money.  It's okay music, but not a keeper.

Amazon review: I don't care what people say.  I don't listen to albums that I don't like.  I'm not going to rate an album with an "X" because I don't like it.  It's not the same as not purchasing a product because you don't buy it.  It's not the same as not buying a product at all.  There have been times in my life where I did not like a product.  I didn't like a product that some of my friends bought.  There have been times in my life where I bought a product and then I didn't like it.  I don't buy things just because some people say that they're good.  It's the same with this album.  I don't like this album.  I don't think it is worth the money.  I just don't think that it's worth the money.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I purchased this song because it was one of the songs my father requested be played at his funeral. And Rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review:             I love this song!!!                It has a very unique sound.               I remember first hearing it when I was at my first concert!  It was great!               Great energy!  The video was nice too.  I was a little nervous at first because I didn't realize that this was a live recording.  It didn't scare me!  I was actually thrilled to learn that this was a live recording and that it was a new song for him!  It was written by the great song writer, Michael Bolton.  As soon as I heard it, I knew that it would be a great song for the new album.  I love this song and will be buying the album!  (My husband and I are very young, so we don't know much about music, so I was a little worried about this one.)

Amazon review:         The song "My Life" was chosen by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences as one of the top ten songs of all time!!               This song is a great example of what a great songwriter can achieve.              I can't wait to hear the new album.             I hope the new album will be just as great as "My Life."

Amazon review:    This was a very easy song to write and I'm very happy with the result.  I'm sure it will be a great song.  The lyrics are so well written I can't believe I wrote them myself.  The music was easy to write too.  It's simple but catchy.  I'm thinking it will be great for the new album.  I'm excited.  I hope the album is great.  I hope the new album will have the same great quality of this song.  The lyrics are very personal.              The song has a very relaxing feel to it.              It's a very mellow song.  The melody is very easy to sing along to.  The lyrics are so catchy they'll be stuck in your head for days and days after hearing the song.  I'm looking forward to the new album!

Amazon review:   If you're looking for something with a bit of a jazz sound, you can't go wrong with this.              This is a great song.  The song is very nice to listen to and I love it.             It's an uplifting song that has a really nice swing to it.  It's a great song. I have to say the best part is that this song is also a great example of how a jazz song can be.  It's very simple but it has an interesting rhythm and melody to it.  The vocals are very nice and the guitar plays an important role in the song.  It's a very cool song.  I love this song!
