Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I listened to this album at least 4 times and I still don't like it. First off, it's the Prince album after all. Second, when he came out with a new album after almost 15 years, I was expecting it to be a whole different sound. Third, the album is a mix of the old songs with the new songs he wrote. The only song I liked was the song "I Would Die 4 U" but that is a bit of an exception because of the song "I Feel For U" which is a pretty, but generic love song. In the end, I think the Prince album is good, but this CD does not live up to its predecessor.

Amazon review: I have never heard an album from Prince, nor have I listened to his music. However, I have been a fan of his music since the 70's and the first Prince album I bought was "Purple Rain" and I still have all of the albums that Prince has released since then. This one surprised me the most, as I was expecting more of a complete album than a collection of songs that seem to be very good. This album is definitely a mixed bag of good songs and bad songs. I found the songs "I Would Die 4 U" and "I Feel For You" to be very good and the songs "Forget About The Pain" and "I Can't Stand The Rain" to be very bad. The album is a mixed bag of good songs and bad songs. I found the songs" I Would Die 4 U" and "I Feel For You" to be beautiful and the songs "Forget About The Pain" and "I Can Not Stand The Rain" to be terrible. The album is definitely a mixed bag of good songs and bad songs. I find the songs "I Would Die 4 U" and "I Feel For U" to be very good and the songs "Forget About The Pain", "I Can't Stand The Rain" and "I Feel For You" to be very bad.

Amazon review: I don't know if you have found out already, but Prince recorded a live album in Madrid in 1989. It was recorded in a studio called Fonitel, which they used in their studio in Paris. I think it was recorded in 1987, but I think it was recorded in 1989. I think it is called I Can't Stand The Rain. It was recorded live by a studio in Madrid, from September to October 1989.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: This is an album with an extremely bad case of copyright infringement.  The artists were actually not credited on the CD and I was told that they had not received a cent for making the music.  The album is called "Viva La Fie."  The lead singer is supposed to be a male rapper named "Gonzo" who goes by the name "Joey."  I am not sure if this is him/her but it has the same name as the album.  However, "Joey" is not from California, nor is he/she from the San Fernando Valley, but from the New York area.  I am not sure if there is a connection to the music but he/she looks like a younger version of the singer on the cover.  I am not sure if the band is actually named "Viva La Fie" or if it is just a title they chose.

Amazon review: As a fan of the New York City-based indie rock band The Postal Service, I was drawn to this CD when it was first released.  It is good, but not a masterpiece that would warrant the rating of "very good."  However, the quality of the songs is better than most CDs out there.  I think the songs themselves are very good, but the quality of the music is not on par with the best musicians.  This CD is very listenable, but the quality of the music is not high enough to bring it down to four stars.

Amazon review: This is a good album to be added to your collection.  The band does not sound like any one else on the market, and this is a good song selection.  The most important thing is that the album was released by a small independent label, so you are getting a great deal.  The only problem with the album is that the CD was released years after the band had gone by.  I am not sure if these were released from the same label, so I would recommend waiting until the CD is re-released.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hard rock and metal.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

So many of us are so afraid to talk about mental health, it's not a good topic to bring up in everyday conversations.  But it's a topic that needs to be discussed.  I know people have gone through these situations and still want to share their stories, so I did my best.  I do not want to be the person who tells you that "You'll get over it."  I do not want to be the person who tells you not to worry about it, because you shouldn't be worried about it.  I do not want to be the person that tells you you're going to be alright either.  It's a scary topic to bring up and I'm not going to pretend to know what's going to happen in your life.  I'm learning as I go, so I'm hoping to be able to help someone else in the future.

I'm sharing my story with you, because I think it's important to know that you're not alone.  It's important to know that if you feel like someone has done something to you, that there is someone to talk to.  I have been through a lot of therapy, and I'm not afraid to talk about it.  I'm not afraid of the stigma of mental health, and I'm not afraid of the stigma of people who suffer from mental health issues.  I'm not afraid for me personally, because I can still get up in the morning and be myself.  In my current situation, I have a job that I love, a family that loves me, and the best friends that I could possibly have.  I just need to work through the other stuff first.  I'm not going to pretend that this is going to happen tomorrow, or that I'm going to be alright, but I know that I'm going to get through this.  It's just a process, a process that takes time, and I think we need to embrace it.  I think it's important to have a support system.  A support system that will help you be the person that you want to be, the one that you dream about being, the one that you want to have.  A support system that gives you advice, and gives you encouragement.  A support system that will encourage you to be the best you can be.  And a support system that will help you to make the decisions that you need.  I've been trying to do that a lot lately.  I may not always make the best decisions, but I think that is a result of being in a place that I needed to be.  I may not always do what I think is right, but I think that is a result of my being in a place that I needed to be.  And I know that I'm not alone in this.  I know that there are people out there that struggle with things that we all struggle with.  I know that there are people out there that don't realize they're struggling with something just because they don't know how to talk to us about it.  And I know that there are people out there that have a hard time understanding us because they're scared of what we might say, or they're scared of what we might not say.  I know that there are people out there who are embarrassed to talk to us because they don't know how to talk to us.  I know that there are people out there that don't want us to tell them because they're afraid of the stigma of suicide.  I know that there are people out there who have a hard time understanding us because of the stigma of mental health.  I know that there are people out there who are scared to come out because they're afraid of the stigma of mental health, or they're afraid of what we might say.  There are people out there that feel alone, and that we're the only ones that they can talk to.  I know that there are people out there that have a hard time understanding me because they're scared of the stigma of mental health, or they're scared of what we might say.  There are people out there that feel embarrassed to talk to us because they don't know how to talk to you about it.  There are people out there that don

The only thing that I do not like is the repetitive "I love you" line in between two verses.  I think that it should be sung much longer.  I do not think that this would be a good choice for a children's choir as it is very old school.  I am sure that most children would love this song I just am not sure that it would be a good choice for children.  I do like the people that sing in this band though.  I also like the violin part in this song.  The way that the violin part interacts with the voice of the violin and the vocals of the choir is very beautiful and emotional.

I have not been able to find any other reviews for this album, but it sounded very good to me.  The choir was very good.  The song was written by a well known music producer and I am sure that he has put in a lot of time into making this a best album.  The song was written in the 60's, but the music is very good.  It was done by a group of people that I am very familiar with.  The music is very sweet, but it is not very repetitive.  I really enjoyed this album, but I do not know who wrote the music.  Overall I do not like this album.  The music was great, but the repetition of the "I love you" line bothered the last part of the song.  The choir was very good, but I have noticed that the men in the choir sometimes make mistakes in the song.  I do not think that this album would be a good choice for the church, but I do think that it would be a good choice for a family or a small group of people.  I do not like the lyrics in the song.  I do not think that this would be a good choice for the youth choir.  The choir really needs to be a little more serious.

I have not heard the first one, but it is very old style soul.  I really like the people that sing in this group.  They are very good.  In fact my favorite choir on this album is the one that I have heard.  They sang "Jesus loves me" in a very high keyed voice, but it sounded really good.  The choir sang "Jesus loves me" in a very high pitch that was very pleasant to listen to.  Overall I think that the music is very good.  The only thing that I do not like is the repetitive "Jesus loves me" line that is sung in between two verses.  I think that it should be sung much more.  I do not think that this would be a good choice for any church choir.  I do not think that this would be a good choice for youth choir either.

But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

So, to me, the music on this album is just ok.  I'll give it a listen in the future though.  I really like the lyrics, but I don't know John's.  I don't understand a word he says.  But I like the music.  It's not bad, it's just not my cup of tea.  I hope he gets better.  I like his music.  But his music is ok.

I was very surprised when I realized how good this album is.  I have heard it and I think it deserves to be listened by every fan of the band.  I also really like the songs by John C.  I would never think how great a singer he is.  The song "Pump It Up" is really good.  The song "Gotta Move" is ok.  The song "I Don't Want to Run" is ok.  The song "Seal the Deal" is ok.  Those are my first impressions of the album.  But I would really like to hear it by heart more.

Amazon review: I love this album!  It's the best Johnny Thunders album I have ever heard.  I love the songs and I think they are wonderful.  The lyrics are great and it has great production.

I still listen to it when I have a chance and I still recommend it to anyone who likes Johnny Thunders.  I'm glad I found this album.  I really enjoy it.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review:  This album is so awful.... I don't know where to begin.  First of all, it is NOT a Christmas album. It is a Christmas CD, but the music is for anyone--anyone who loves Christmas music.  It is a collection of very boring and repetitive songs written and performed by a man who clearly is not familiar with the standards and traditions of Christmas music.  There's a lot of very dull piano playing, but no piano singing.  The vocalists don't even try to be original.  They just repeat the same old Christmas carols, and the only exceptions are when they cover a simple and beautiful new song.  And the chorus singers are in the same bland voices.  It's really a shame, because I've been a fan of the music since the beginning.  This album is just awful.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I will gladly sell this album for twice its value and send you a refund, because it is simply the worst Christmas album I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Wow.
This is a really, really, really bad album.  It's only three songs long, and all three are on the same instrument.  The second one, which is a duet with a male singer, is sung by a female singer.  No matter how hard I tried, I could never figure out how to do the first song.  The duet is the worst of the three.  The music is so bad it's not even funny.  I would rather listen to the boring, repetitive "You are my sunshine" than this.  I don't even know that this song is supposed to be a Christmas song.  It's so bad I can't even tell you what it's about.  It's all so bad I would rather listen to the boring "Santa Baby" than this, and I can't even tell you what the title of the other song is.  You have to be a very, very, very, very sad person to buy this album.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.

Amazon review: I bought this for my son, and I wasn't disappointed. I did have some problems with the CD-R and couldn't get the software to work properly. When I realized that the CD wasn't working I went to the seller's website to see if they had a refund policy, and that's when I found out they don't. If you want a good deal on a used CD-R, I'd say this is the one to buy. All songs are good.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album could have been better, but I cannot listen to it as often as I should, as it is so generic. The backing is ok, I am usually more in favor of the song than the backing, but the backing is usually terrible. Just a generic album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked this album. I think it is a great way to get people to listen to Pink Floyd and the whole sound of the album is great. I think the only thing I really disliked was the backing singers. I don't know how Pink Floyd could have done the album without them. The only song I really disliked was Echoes. I loved the song, but the backing was so bland and so generic. I think a lot of people could have gotten by with something like This is the Day, but with a little more passion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album (and the way it was recorded makes it even better). The musicianship is great, and it's definitely a great Pink Floyd album. The thing is, I just don't like a lot of the music, and it's just not my cup of tea. The songs are just not for me, and I just cannot get into it. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it but I just don't like it.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review:  The music was okay. The lyrics were okay.  The voice was okay.  I am not a sucker for anthems, and this one is no exception.  I am very disappointed.

Amazon review:  I love the title of the album.  The music is a little over-produced, but that is more to do with trying to keep the CD's price under $20.  The vocals are okay, but the lyrics are not memorable.  I think the CD will be more successful if we can find a better label to distribute it.

Amazon review:  The only reason I chose this CD is because it's a new release, and I wanted something different.  Unfortunately, this CD was not worth it.

There are some good songs here, but most of them have weak vocals.  The lyrics are decent, but the music is mediocre.  What the hell was the point of putting this CD out?  I think this was a waste of my money.

Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I've heard her vocals on a couple of songs before, but I was never very impressed. Not that she's bad, but I think it would be more impressive if she could sing her own songs, and not have to rely on other people to write the songs. That's not to say it's a bad album, but there's definitely a lot to like here.

Amazon review: I've been to her performance in Europe and have heard two of the songs. One of them being "Teddy" is a lot better than the other one I heard. The song "No One" is a standout that I think I won't be able to live without. I like the songs, but they aren't really my favorites.

Amazon review: I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was so happy to find this CD, I bought 2 copies and gave one to a friend who was on the fence about buying this CD. I do not understand why this CD is only available on Amazon.com.  The vocals are very annoying and the songs are repetitive.  This CD does not stand on its own.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD to replace an old one of the same artist.  The CD is just a waste of money.  The vocals are too low and it is difficult to hear the singing.  I did not know the music was sung by a man until it was too late. I have had to buy another CD of his music.  It is not in the same league as the first CD - just my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
