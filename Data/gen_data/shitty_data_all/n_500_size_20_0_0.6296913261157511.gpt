Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: This is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I think it is a great song for any occasion. It is versatile and can be performed in a variety of styles, and it is extremely easy to learn. If you are looking for a relaxing song to listen to when you are in a bathtub, this is it.

Amazon review: I love the jingle bells and whistles that the band uses, but I also have to say, if you're going to make me play this song in the background, just make it a little less annoying.  This song is not too bad, but it would be better if the band had a little more control over the sound.  Overall, I would suggest this as a Christmas song.  I've also played this song in the car.  I like it better that way because I can use my ipod, and I can take it with me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's a great song.  If you get the download, make sure you have it on mp3 or wma.  The first time I listened to it and played it in the car, the sound was just too high for the car stereo.  It sounds better in other songs.  I think if you listen to it in this mode, you may be able to hear some of the band's mistakes.

Amazon review:  I love this song, and I have to say that a few years ago I was driving on the same road in an older car, when I took the wheel, the radio was playing this song, and I thought, this song will be awesome as I'm driving across the country.  I stopped, and it was only about a half mile from the house, so I turned the radio off and drove home after listening to this song, I was so excited that I had never been there before.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I really liked this song, but I have some critiques.  The first thing I thought about was the fact that it was very loud in the car.  I think that if you listen to this song in the car you might be able to hear the mistakes.  The second thing I thought was that I would have preferred if the "chicken" sound was a little more subtle.  At first I thought maybe it was an echo, but it's not, so it must be a real chicken sound.  The only way I could figure out what it was was that when I was driving, I heard the song and realized it was a chicken sound, but I didn't think to ask the band what it was.

Amazon review: I've been hearing this song for a long time, but I'd never seen it.  When I saw this review, I realized they just changed the song slightly and added new songs, but I think my favorite part is when they play "Santa Claus is Coming to Town".  I've been listening to this song constantly and it's always good to hear it again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song!  It's a great way to start the day!  The only real problem is the last note of the song--it sounds like it's coming from deep inside your head!  A little more volume may help with that problem--I've been listening to this song quite a bit lately, and I think I'm getting used to it!  I love the song--it's fun and it has a great vibe to it.  It's a very old-timey, jingle-bell kind of song.  I like it!  I liked the sound better when it was a little quieter--it didn't sound as annoying when it was a little louder.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  It's a great song!  I've heard this song quite a few times, and I always find myself singing along with it.  It's a jingle-bell kind of song.  Some of the lines make me think of old-timey Christmas songs--"It's the season for giving, when the good Lord gives."  It's perfect for the season.  I really liked the way the song was mixed--I didn't like the sound of the drums or the guitar when it was first played.  It was better when the drums and guitar got more of a kick in--but even still, it was still a little too loud for the car.  I liked the song when it was a little quieter--now it sounds a lot better in the car.  I also liked the way the song was mixed--it's a cool, jingle-bell kind of song.  I don't like the drums a lot--I think they sound more like a bass drum rather than a drum.  I really like how the song was mixed--it made the song a little more fun in the car!

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Hey dude, I'm getting a lot of negative reviews for this CD, but it's not just me, I'm sure a lot of people are getting the same negative review too.  But, it's not my negativity that is the problem, it's the fact that I am not into this type of music. And I'm not trying to be a smart ass, I'm just being an intelligent man and that is what I've got to say. I listened to this CD for 90 seconds and realized that I was just wasting my time. I have always told people that I think it is a waste of time to listen to anything in the genre. Why would I spend time on something that sounds like someone from another planet that's in space?  I don't know why people think it is a good CD.  It's garbage.  I don't care if it sells one more copy, but I will make sure that I'm not buying it again, and I will not buy another copy of it.  I don't like this type of music, and I will not buy it.

Amazon review: I've been waiting to buy this cd for a long time, and it's finally here.  I have heard of this group and have been collecting albums from them for years, but have only been able to find a few of their CDs, but I finally found one to my liking.  This is a great little cd and I would recommend it to anyone.  I would also recommend that any of their other albums be added to the list, because they have a great variety of music.  This is a great cd for those who have always wanted to listen to a clean version of their favorite songs, as they come to the end of the cd, it's just the clean version of the songs that have been edited out, but I think it's a good cd.  I would buy another cd from this band and would recommend this one if you listen to clean versions of your favorite songs. I would also recommend their other cd's, I don't care what genre of music they play, just as long as they play some good clean versions of their favorite songs.  This cd is worth the money it cost, and I would buy more of their CDs. I would buy more of this cd, until it's gone. I wish I could buy this cd as a gift for someone, and I would buy it as a gift for myself.  I think it's a great cd, and I would recommend any clean version of their songs to anyone.

Amazon review: I don't know how to explain it.  It's the most creative song ever, but it just doesn't make any sense.  To me it's like the lyrics are in some kind of foreign language and the music is playing in some other language - and I've got no clue how to describe it.  I've tried to listen to it a few times and I just can't get my head around what's being said.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

I have a copy of this I've been playing for years at home, and it is a wonderful song to listen to it with a glass of wine in the evening. I've done a lot of drinking in the last few years, the past two years, and if there's anything I've learned it's not to drink too much.
I'm not sure why it has such a nice effect on me, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: This album is a lot of fun.  The vocals are fantastic, and the arrangements are also really great.  If you love the music of Belly live, this is a must have.  I just wish it had been released as a self-release to avoid the major label interference.

Amazon review: I find this album to be the most annoying.  The vocals are terrible.  I can't get through the first 5 songs.  The next 4 are good.  The last 2 are just noise.

Amazon review: I don't like this album very much.  It's good but I just don't like the music.  There are no vocals that I like.  There are some good songs but the lyrics are terrible.  It's more like an instrumental album.  It sounds like someone is playing a keyboard and singing to people.

I just don't like the music and lyrics.  All the songs are pretty good, but they're all just kind of similar.  They are great songs, but the lyrics just make them feel like they aren't good.  That's a minor complaint though.  Overall it is a good album, just not the type of album you would expect from an artist like Belly.

I've listened to this album a few times and still can't get over it.  It reminds me of Belly's music.

Amazon review: Belly is a good musician and a good singer.  I don't think he's a great singer.  He's better than average at the most things.  He's not that much better than average on vocals, but he sings a good song.  It's just the lyrics are horrible.  Really horrible.  It's not bad, it just sounds like it's a lot of repeating the word "baby"

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: First of all, I was blown away by the quality of this album, and I was very impressed with the variety of choices on the album. I am a big fan of the artist Sunland and I am glad that I got her new album. I like sunland, but I did not like the cd. I have listened to two of the songs on it and they are weak, and I have not liked them. I have a lot of songs to choose from. You have to remember that the cd was $7.99. I do not know if I will listen to the cd again, but I think that I will. I do not think that a $7.99 cd is worth what I paid for it. I could have bought the cd for $15.00 but I am not happy with my purchase.

Amazon review: I love the music of this artist. I have been looking for a Sunland album for a while. I was very surprised to find that she had a new album out. I am very pleased with the album.

I am very pleased with the album. I have listened to the album and I love it.

Amazon review: Very disappointed in this CD. I am disappointed that this CD is an "artist album". I know this is not very cool, but I am disappointed that this CD is an "artist album".

I would have liked to have known that she was working on a new album, but I am not disappointed.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really didn't consider this a post-hardcore release.  It is, however, the first major label release by the band (it was on the independent label, the other members of which are much more accomplished).  I would like to see them do something that is less off-the-wall and more consistent.  I also feel that they are too often forced to play too many songs with too much variety, which leads to the band sounding like one giant set of random riffs.  I feel like this album is supposed to be their second, and I think it is very much a step in the right direction.  I like the band, and I really dig the sound of their first demo-release, "Mountain Song".  I also like that they have the ability to do several things at once, which I personally like.  I am curious to see how they can do this with future releases.  I think the next album will be their best.  They have a sound that is more cohesive, and the band seems to have more in common now with the other acts with whom they are associated.  I am most excited for the next album and hope it will be better.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like the sound of this record.  I do not know if it is an improvement or an improvement over the previous two releases, but, I do know that I will continue to buy the band's releases.  I really do not know what I am supposed to be looking for, but I am hoping to find something that I will like.  The second half of the album has a lot of that "jangly" sound that I have become a fan of, that I really like.  I think it is a great direction for the band to take.  There are some really cool arrangements on the album, and I really like the harmonies.  I like the production values, and the songs are really well-written.  I do not know what other people are looking for when it comes to listening to the band, but I really do not know.  I am just going to have to take what I like and hope that the rest will like it.

Amazon review: I am enjoying listening to this album.

I think that it is pretty typical for bands to change, and I think that it is going to be an interesting thing to see as the band grows.  I think that this will be an important point to see how they develop, and will continue to watch that in the future as the band grows.  I think that the band is going to grow and change a lot, and I want to see it all unfold.  I think that they are definitely going to become a great band, and I am excited for that.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: Farrah is a very talented woman, but her singing on this album is atrocious. The only reason i bought this album is the cover art. I think it is just a bit too "pop" for what she's trying to do, and it doesn't fit with her personality or her character.

Amazon review: Farrah has a beautiful voice, i love her songs and everything she does, but i do feel that she needs to use that voice more and give it more of a rock edge, not to mention this is an album of only 4 songs, i think it would have been better if she had done an album of 10 or 15 songs.

Amazon review: The song is great.  But, this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song, making it impossible for me to listen to.

A:

I think the problem is the recording, not the song. I hear the problem more on the first chorus than on the rest of the song.
You can listen to the full song just once or twice. But there are plenty of other songs for you to listen to and enjoy, and it sounds as though they are singing in 3 different voices on this one.
In other words, the problem is not the music, not a problem with your headphones, but the microphone.
The music can be improved by lowering the volume a little bit.

 The vocals are a little bit too high pitched, and the background is a little bit too tinny.

If you can hear that, that's probably the problem. I'm not a recording engineer, so I'm not sure what I'd do about it.

 The vocals really sound almost perfect, and the recording is not too bad, but there is no real harm done.

The problem is not just there, but is very much the reason that you have problems with the rest of the song.

 There is no harm in the recording, but it could be improved.

The problem is that the band is singing in three different voices.

 I don't know whether that is intentional, but I can guess that it is.

I know you don't like to be told what to do, but your problem is that you don't understand what is happening.

 I don't think anyone is telling you what to do, but you don't seem to grasp what is happening.

This is not the first time you have complained about a particular recording. We've heard you complain about the recording of this song before, and it's not the first time that you have complained about what is happening.

 I think you were told what to do before and it was not working.

You should not be asking about the recording, but about this band.

 No, but I'm still complaining about this band.

If you are able to understand what is happening, you should stop complaining.

 I don't think I can stop complaining about this band.

 You should not be asking about the band, but you should stop complaining about this band.

I'll help you out though.

 The band is singing in three different voices.

I'm not sure what you're trying to suggest here.

 The band is singing in three different voices.

It's not that I don't know what you are trying to suggest, it's that I don't know what you are suggesting.

 I'm not suggesting anything.

This is not the first time you've complained about this band.

 That's what I'm trying to tell you.

I'm not sure what you're trying to suggest here either.

 I'm not suggesting anything.

It should be clear to you by now that you are unable to listen to the song properly.

 I'm not suggesting anything.

###

 This is not the first time you have complained about this band.

 I know this is the first time I've complained about this band.

That makes it much worse.

 That's what I'm trying to tell you.

###

 This is not the first time you have complained.

 I have complained about this band as well.

###

 This is not the first time you have complained, but not about the recording.

 That's what I'm trying to tell you.

What is the difference between complaining about the recording and complaining about the band?

 I don't know. I know that some people have complained about this band, but they have not complained about the recording.

I think you should stop complaining about this band.

 I'm not sure I can do that, but I'm not sure why you are asking me to stop complaining about this band

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
