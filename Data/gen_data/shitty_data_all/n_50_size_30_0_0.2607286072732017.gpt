Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: The first time I ever saw Lin Manuel Miranda perform was at the 2007 Kennedy Center Honors. He did not sing the song "The Boy From New York". I was not aware of that song. So when I first heard this song, I was a little confused. It is not like I knew that he was going to sing it. I was confused because the first time I heard this song was on Broadway. I was not sure if they were going to play it as a Broadway number or if they would put it on a CD. I was wrong. The first time I heard Lin Manuel Miranda sing this song was at the Kennedy Center Honors. The song was a hit on Broadway. It got nominated for Best Choreography. It has a great opening line that makes you want to hear the rest of the song. I was a little surprised at how well the song was performed. I was surprised because I was really not expecting that song to be so good. I have never heard a song like this before. I have never been so impressed with a song. There is a part of me that wishes I had not heard this song. This is one of the songs that I have been hearing a lot. I am a little embarrassed that I have not heard this song since I was in high school. I am a little embarrassed that I have not heard this song since high school. Lin Manuel Miranda is one of my favorite singers. He has a beautiful voice. The second time I ever saw Lin Manuel Miranda perform was in a concert at the Public Theatre in Chicago. I was surprised at how good he was. This was the first time I had heard him sing in a concert. I was not expecting him to be that great. I was not even expecting him to be that good. I was not expecting him to be that good. I was not expecting him to be as good as he was. I was not expecting him to be as good as he was. The only thing that I was not expecting was the performance.

Amazon review: This is a great CD. I have been playing this CD for the past couple of weeks and it has been a blessing to me. I have been doing alot of thinking about and listening to God's Word and His songs. I have been struggling with my faith lately and was looking for a good way to get back to God. This CD helped me remember His Word and He has blessed me deeply with this CD. I have been listening to his CD's since the first one. I have bought several of his other CDs and they have all been great. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a great Christian music CD.

I have also listened to Christian Radio and I have listened to Christian Music all around the world. This is the kind of music that I think God wants me to listen to, and I am glad to share it with you. This is a great Christian song which reminds me of the Lord Jesus Christ and His love for us.

This CD contains four songs based on the book of Esther by Jewish author, Josephus. The music is beautiful. My favorite is the third song. I also like the song with the words "God is my Light and my Salvation" and the second one. The song with the words "You Are A Good Person" is very touching.

My husband and I have been in touch with the church where he was baptized because we have a family member who was baptized there. We have talked with their youth group and they told us about the CD. We enjoyed listening to it, and my husband is looking forward to seeing the video. However, I am disappointed in the fact that I am not going to be able to listen to it until after we have signed up for the church's Christmas program.

This is a great Christian album for worship and the message of hope. The songs are written to help me live out my faith.

I have a friend who has been going to this church for years. She really enjoys the music and the message. She has been to the service and the message is great. She will purchase this CD for her family members and friends.

The songs are written to help me live out my faith, not to show me how great my family is or to praise me.

I have a friend who has been going to this church, and he really loves the music and the message. I have been to the service and the music is wonderful. However, he does not read the songs very well. He does not follow the words or the story very well. I really think he would be better served by a different church.

I have a friend who has been going to this church and she really enjoys the music and the message. She has been to the service, and the music is wonderful. She reads the lyrics to the songs and follows the words to the story. I believe she would be better served by a different church.

I purchased this CD for my daughter who is a member of this church. The songs are very well written and the message to the songs are great!

I used to attend this church. However, the music and message change over the years. I do not know where I would go to find a church that has the same message and music. It seems that the church is getting a little stagnant.

This is a musical CD of great value. The lyrics are short and simple, and the music has a good beat. It's not the typical Christmas music, but it's good enough to do the job.

I have been attending this church since I was a sophomore in high school. I have always been in awe of the message of the Word of God, and this message has been spreading like wildfire. I have no problem with the music, as I enjoy listening to a variety of music. However, I wish that they would bring back the hymns that they used to have.

I have attended this church my entire life. I am a member of the Junior League. I have attended the church since the age of 10. I have been to a lot of services, I have been baptized in the water and I have attended a lot of the Bible studies. I have sung in the choir since I was 12 years old and have never had a problem with the music.

This is a great CD, and I'm looking forward to giving it as a gift to all my church friends.

I enjoy the music and the message. I have listened to this CD once before. However, the message was not as current as it

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Wow, what a good album.  The album is a collection of the best of the best music from throughout time, including music from the past century.  There are many, many things to love about this album.  The album was released in 1987.  Many of the songs were created when this album was released.  That is why some of the songs do not have recordings from the '70's.  The album is great for both classical and pop/rock fans.  The album is a collection of songs that are very similar, but that are not the same, yet they are all great.  This is a very fun, enjoyable album.  Many of the songs are a little slow.  Still, I was able to enjoy the album.  The album contains over 100 songs.

So I put together a list of songs that I thought would be ideal for my son to hear.  So I have been listening to this CD over and over.  The song that he chose is a song that I had never heard before.  It is called "When My Baby's Cold".  He loves it and I love it.  I listened to this CD and I was blown away.  I thought "I wonder if I could have a CD like this for my son".  I told him that I was going to buy the CD that I had put together for him and he could just listen to it.  So I bought the CD that I had put together for him and we listened to it.  The other songs on the CD are great but when I got to the song that he had chosen, "When My Baby's Cold", he was so excited.  He had been asking me for months to get a CD for him.  So, after we listened to the song that he had chosen, I was so excited, I had to buy the CD.  I was so happy that I did.  I loved this CD so much, I wanted to give it to my mother and my mother-in-law.  I was so happy because they both love

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised when I first heard this album. I am glad that I have bought it. The CD is well-recorded, and I am very impressed with the song selection. The music is simple but enjoyable.  I have always liked the sound of the bluegrass on the albums I have been familiar with, but this CD has a slightly different sound and I enjoyed the new sound.

Amazon review: Wow. This CD is everything I've come to expect from Libera.  The quality of the recording is very high, and the instrumentation is just right.  The songs are great, and have all the elements that I love about folk-pop.    As I listened to the album, I kept thinking to myself, "What's not as good as this?"    There are good songs, like "Walking a Long Road," "The Song of the Wind," and "The Way You Smile," but most of the songs are not as good as this CD.    If you're looking for a new album to listen to, this is a good one. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre of folk-pop.

I bought this on Amazon.  It was not shipped to me. Now I have no cd.  My mother will not buy me another cd.  I need to get my brother to buy me a cd.  I can't tell him to buy me a cd.  He's already not happy with me.  I hate him.  I want to hate him.  But I can't.  He's my brother.  I have to love him, but I don't want to.  He's not a good brother.
**My mother came home from work and told me that she and my brother had a fight.  She said he did not buy me a cd.  I told her I wanted to buy him a cd.  I told her I wanted to listen to one of my favorite cd's.  She was just mad at me for not buying him a cd.  That's all.  She didn't even care that I wanted to buy him a cd.  I don't care if she loves me.  I don't care if she hates me.  I just want to get my brother to buy me a cd.  I want us to be happy.  When I say "us", I mean "me".

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

-the lyrics are sweet and so true
-the vocals are so unique

-the whole band is great
When I first heard them, I thought "Wow, these guys are an awesome band." I thought their sound was going to be a little different, but their sound is just awesome.
Now, I know they are just a bunch of guys who play a lot of original songs, but they have just as much talent as any other band out there. I highly recommend checking them out.

Amazon review: I love these guys. I've been listening to them since I was 12. I love the riffs, the songs, and the musicianship. I've been listening to them since I was a kid and I can't imagine being in a band with any other musicians.
Their music is just awesome, and their lyrics are so catchy. Their sound is a little different from the rest of the bluegrass/folk scene, but it works really well. Their music is so unique and it's really hard to explain how I feel about them because they're just so different and stand out in such a positive way.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Not a good album in the least bit.

The most annoying song in this whole thing is "Possibilities" and the follow up to it, I mean, really, this song has nothing going for it.

"Bust a Move" is a good song, "Bust a Move" is just a good song, "Bust a Move" is a good song, why did it have to be a song about busting moves?.  It's so generic it could have been recorded by anyone.  The song "Possibilities" is a good song, but again, why did it have to be a song about possibilities?.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This CD is ok, kind of boring to listen to. It has some songs I enjoy, but most of the music is just too repetitive.  It sounds like Libera picked out one or two songs to use in his choral works and then made 2 more choral works that consist of the same songs.

I love his voice and I really do hope that he becomes famous, so that he can make a new album that is different from the one he already released.

Amazon review: Great CD - I like this album a lot.  It has a lot of variety and a lot of good choral music.  I bought it for my granddaughter.  Her husband has a small organ (an old one) and has been very interested in choral music.  So I thought, with this CD, it would be a good idea to get a choral CD for her and she could listen to it and learn some choral music with her husband.  But, after the first two songs (I think), I realized that the organ sounds were so distorted that it didn't seem to be working for her husband.  He asked me if he should stop listening to the CD.

A:

This is a great collection of choral music and it is a good idea to have these on your car.  They are a fun way to listen to classic choral music.
In fact, you could play them during your commute to work or in your downtime at work.  In fact, I play them almost every day.  And these are not the typical choral pieces you'd find on more modern recordings.
I also recommend the following for your enjoyment:

"The Four Seasons"

This is a collection of four seasonal choral pieces.  They are all delightful.

"O Come, All Ye Faithful"

This is a wonderful work for children.  They will love it.

"Ave Maria"

This is a wonderful hymn.  You can also change the tempo by simply changing the tempo on the CD player.

"The Seasons"

This is a collection of four seasonal choral pieces, all of which are delightful.

"Hail to the Chief"

This is a wonderful work for children.  They will like it.

"Ave Maria"

This is a lovely little piece for children.  It is also a great piece for adults.  It is also a great work for adults.

"Ave Maria"

The CD has a very nice quality.  The songs are all very pleasant to listen to.  The liner notes also give good insight into the songs.

A:

I like this album.  I agree with the other reviews, too.  I have a copy on CD and also have a mp3 player with a CD on it.  I listen to it in the car or when I am in the shower.  I also have a library of CDs; when I am on vacation I take one away and listen to it at home.
I love the sound of the music and the harmonies.  I like the variety of styles.  This is one of my top choices.

 
Music from 

 Dallas Holm

The CD

1.  O Come, all ye Faithful 
2.  O Holy Night 
3.  The Four Seasons 
4.  When All is Said and Done

I think the liner notes are good, too.  They give a little background on each song.

A:

I like the album, but there were a few things that bother me.  They are minor things and perhaps not worth mentioning, but they were annoying.

1.  I thought the songs were repeated several times.  I noticed that "The Four Seasons" is repeated three times.  It is repeated three times in each of the songs.  It is repeated three times in "Ave Maria" and "Hail to the Chief".  In "Ave Maria" and "The Four

I don't really know much about them but I do know they put out a few really good songs so I thought I'd give you guys my take on the album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this as an "alternative" to the old school "rock" I really enjoyed it.  Can't say I cared much for the vocals.  The album starts decent but gets boring fast with not much variety in the music.  I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the "rock" I was used to (a few years ago) but it appears that was a mistake.  I will not buy anything else from the band and that includes all of the previous albums.  I bought this album thinking that it would be a "new" hip hop album filled with "no rules" but I was sorely disappointed.  I could have gotten into it (for a time) but there are very few "no rules" songs.  I give this a "1" for originality.  I wish I would have bought it if I could have and not wasted my money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this album was just a bit of fun, but I was wrong.  Thalia is truly talented and she has a good voice but her attempts at singing are pitiful at best.  I have no idea how she can sing at anything other than high notes.  The lyrics are good, but the music is just not any better.  The only good thing about this album is the cover of "I Know You Got Soul" by The Black Eyed Peas.  I think the cover will sell a lot of copies.  Just not worth the money.

Amazon review: I have never liked any of the Ozzie's albums but this one I have to admit I didn't give it a chance.  I was not expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the effort put into this album.  I will give it a 4.  The songs are good and there are some decent cover versions.  However, the album's best asset is its quality of production.  Ozzie's music is just all over the place and this is no exception.  I'll be waiting for the next album.  It will be worth the wait.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought "Ain't No Pussy No" because I thought it was a fun record, but it was not.  The song has a nice beat and the lyrics are decent, but the song is missing some beats and the vocalist has a very nasally voice.  The album is a bit boring, but the song is just okay.  I'm not sure this is one of Ozzie's best.

Amazon review: I have not heard this new album but I would say it was not as good as the other two albums.  I think it was a little bit too long, but it also includes a good amount of songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Like the songs were recorded by a bunch of people working in a room with no windows.

The song "My Old Kentucky Home" is just about the only exception.  I am not disappointed in that one either.
