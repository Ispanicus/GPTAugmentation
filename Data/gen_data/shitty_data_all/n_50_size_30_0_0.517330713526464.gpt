Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Thalia is the singer and the best female singer in the world at the moment. This CD is very exciting. I am an old man, but I love to hear Thalia sing. I am a fan of the new generation of singers. I do not understand why I do not see the "Nymphet of the new wave" in the new generation. I hope that a new generation does not get a bad name like the one of this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have to say, I hate that this is an "accapella" and not the entire song.  I find it to be a lot of filler and not that interesting.  I will not purchase this unless it is a stand alone album or is a song that I know will not be missing the entire song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was disappointed after the first listen.  The acoustic guitar part is not anything special and the vocals just don't come off. There are some great lyrics, but they are just not memorable enough to me. That is not to say that I wouldn't give this album another chance if I wanted to. It is just something that I don't enjoy.

Amazon review: I would give this album a one star if I had the opportunity to listen to it more time. I thought it was a really good album at the time but over time, I would probably still give it a one star.  I don't enjoy the acoustic version much either.  I would say the electric version is a better album. I don't think they're trying to be bluegrass or folk but I think they could have done better. The electric version is better.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of this album from the mid 80's.  I would take it out and listen to it constantly.  I just got the CD last month and I can not get the lyrics to the song "Love is a Song" out of my head.  I want to buy this album.  The sound quality on this album is great.  I can not believe that there is a CD of this type that doesn't have the proper lyrics on it.  That is my fault for not reading the liner notes before buying it.

Amazon review: Just got my first CD from Smooth Jazz.  This is the only one I have purchased from this company in the past.  I have been trying to find another CD with all of the Smooth Jazz artists.  I have not heard any other CDs with Jax-Smooth Jazz.  But this one is very nice.  The sound quality of this CD is perfect.  I just wish the lyrics were on it.  I would love to have this CD.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this music since I was a teenager.  I got this CD from my brother who was a fan of this music.  I thought this was the best Smooth Jazz CD I had ever heard.  It's not until I recently got the CD that I noticed the track listing on this CD had been changed.  I love this CD.  It's not until I started hearing the other Smooth Jazz CD's that I realize that they were all recorded by the same artist.  I'll have to get this CD.  It's so great.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: First of all, this is the same as buying a used car. If you are not in the market for a brand new car, it would be best to pass on this album.  The first few tracks are good, but I am afraid that in subsequent tracks, they are all about the same.  The first track is OK, the second track is OK, the third track is OK and so on.  This is one of the few albums I have ever purchased that I have actually listened to.  I just like the sound of it.  It is not very good, but at least it had some good tracks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album sounds like a horrible ripoff of "Nirvana's Nevermind" with the vocals and drums replaced by other instruments.  It has no sense of humor.  I really enjoyed the first 6 tracks, but after that, the music becomes very mediocre and boring.  I would give this one a 3 out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a waste of money, the worst album of the year.  I have listened to this album a total of 14 times since I bought it and still have not gotten past the first track.

Amazon review: I really am glad I purchased this.  At first I thought it was going to be a bunch of songs that were just like each other, but then I started to hear the music that was actually unique to this album.

###
Amazon review: I will definitely be buying the album, but the only thing I will say is that the quality is terrible.  The only thing worth listening to is the last two songs, "This is What I Believe" and "The Great Escape."  The rest are just like every other song.  It seems like the band has moved on to other projects, and I think it's sad.  This is not worth buying.  I will not be buying it, and I will not be listening to it again.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was not dissapointed with the first album by a R. Kelly or singer in many years. I will say that I feel it was a bit to long and the vocals were very uneven. But other than that, I find him to be a very talented artist. I would like to see him stay on the road for a few more albums.

My thoughts: One of my favorite albums of all time! I love the songs and have listened to it over and over again. I have a collection of R. Kelly albums that I listen to on repeat all the time. I have to admit however, I was a little dissapointed in this album. I did not like the sound of the vocals. They were a little off and the lyrics were not my favorite. But what can you expect from a man who has been accused of molesting more than 5000 children? I am not sure if I will buy any of his albums but I will not be dissapointed with this one.

My thoughts: I was a bit dissapointed when this album came out. I am not a big fan of R. Kelly's music. I like his music for the most part but I just cannot stand his vocals. I have listened to this song on repeat for months now. I love the song and how it is sung. I cannot wait to listen to it over and over again when I am on the road. I also bought the CD for my wife. It is her birthday and I am giving her this CD to listen to on her birthday. She loves R. Kelly, so I thought she would enjoy the music.

My thoughts: This album is very well made. It has an amazing sound. It is very well produced with an amazing background. The album is a very good listen and will not disappoint.

My thoughts: I love the music and the lyrics. I like the album a lot, but the vocals on this album are very annoying. I don't care what type of music R. Kelly sings, he is a musician, he should sing what he wants to sing and I will enjoy it, not just because I like it, but because I know it will be performed well.

My thoughts: I love the music and the lyrics. This is a very good album, I wish it was longer, but the singing is so annoying. I wish R. Kelly would stop singing. If I could choose anything in this world, it would be R. Kelly's singing. (Not my song, as I have not written it.)

My thoughts: I have been a fan of R. Kelly for years and this album is amazing. I love the songs, the lyrics, and the vocals. I would recommend this album to any fan of R. Kelly.

My thoughts: This is my favorite R. Kelly album. I love the music and the lyrics. I have this album on repeat for months now. I really like it.

I do not find this a big deal because I think that it is a CD for the listeners.  I would rather have an all-digital release from a label like Stones Throw.  The production was good.  I was just not impressed with the song "Ride on Train" because it was very boring, and I think it should have been called "Ride on the train".

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is a fine recording, excellent in every way.  The piano and clarinet is particularly well done.  The clarinet is not as bright as it could be.  I would certainly recommend it for the pianist, but not for the student of the piano, or the beginner of the clarinet.

Amazon review: The only thing I can say about this recording is that there is no substitute for the "real thing."  The problem is that the artist who created it has been dead for years.  This recording is as close as the real thing can get and can be recommended.  I am a professional musician, but I will not play what is not there.  It is just me who is being inconsistent. I think I should be able to hear what is there, but I cannot.  I have a theory, that the composer is not there.  And in this case, I am right. I think that the composer is not there.  The only reason I can't hear what he writes is because he is not there.

Amazon review: It is not fair that an artist who was so prolific, who was so great, who influenced so many people, and who had so many friends and fans, has been forgotten.  I have a lot of respect for him as an artist, and his music as well, but there is no reason why he should be forgotten.  He was a wonderful musician, and I am sure that he would have been very proud of his accomplishments, but it seems the public and media have been more interested in the fact that he was a drug addict, and had a string of lovers, and was not loved by his family, and was a great man, and not a great musician.  I think that he should have been much more.  He was a great man, but not a great musician or a great artist.  I think his music is great, but I think he should have been much more. He should have been the greatest of all time. He should have inspired people to live their lives their way, but he didn't.  He should have been the best, and if he was the best, he should have inspired people to be better, and not forget what the greatest artist was.  This is a great tragedy for our culture, and I think it is a tragedy for our art.  Music is supposed to be a celebration of life, and the artist who inspired us to live our lives our way should have inspired us to be better, and to be loved by him and his family, and he should have inspired us to live our lives his way, and to be remembered by him and his family and his fans.  I think that his fans should be there, and they should be the ones that should be there, because he was very proud of his fans, and they should be proud of him, and they should be there for him and his family.  I think it is important for his fans to be there, but there is no reason why he should be forgotten, and I don't think it is fair.  I think it is important that his fans be there, but I think it is unfair that no one is there for him, and that his fans should be there for him, and that his fans should be the ones that should be there, because he should be there for them.

Amazon review: This is an album that has some serious potential, to be more than a tribute to a great musician, to be more than just a tribute to the man who inspired a great artist, it has an immense potential to be a great tribute to the artist who inspired a great musician. The problem is that the artist who inspired him is dead, and the only thing that is on this album is a tribute to a great musician.

Amazon review: I first heard this song when I saw the movie of the musical.  I listened to the song many times later, and  it is still one of my favorites.  Lyrics are very simple, and the vocals are not as powerful as the original version.  The melody is just beautiful.  The only problem I have with the song is the vocals, they are not as powerful as the original version, and it seems that they could have been a little stronger.  I would suggest that if you are a fan of the original version, you do not listen to the remix on this album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I bought this for the CD, just to see how it would sound.  I like Mumford and all but this music just doesn't excite me. There is nothing wrong with the songs on track 2 but the songs on track 3 are just too repetitive.  Just my opinion, but I don't know what is wrong with this band.  I hate when a band has only one song that I like.  I don't know what the band is trying to do.  I don't know if they were trying to make a career or if they were trying to make a statement.  I think the band is very talented and have a great musical style, but the songs are too ordinary to be played on radio.  I am not saying I do not like Mumford, I do.  I just don't want to get caught up in this hype. I am just a casual listener and have not bought any of their records.

I'm glad I bought this album.  I can see why people are so excited about this album.

Amazon review: I bought the song "Breathe" from Amazon.  I have listened to it several times and it is very good.  The only problem is that it is just a song.  The rest of the album is good.  I'm not sure if the music is really that good or if they were just trying to get songs on this CD for their next album.  I'm not sure if I would buy another album if I didn't like this one.  I don't know what to think about it.  One song is not enough.  I don't know if the band was trying to make a statement or if they were just trying to make it on the radio.  I don't know what to think.  I don't like the music. I'm just glad I bought it.

"I don't know how to express the meaning of the words "great" and "greatest" in one sentence.

This is a great album with great songs.

Great album to listen to with a group of friends, a couple of lovers, or with family.

This is the greatest collection of songs of all time.

If I said the words "greatest" and "great" in one sentence, I would be lying.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought that the CD was well crafted and really sounded good.  However, I found the album to be very repetitive and boring after listening to it a number of times.    The songs were great, but the tracks were so long that I had to turn it off after listening to them a number of times and then restart the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the music of Libera and the sound of the CD is a great compliment to the music.    The CD is also very well crafted and the song selections were great.   I wish I had received a CD for Christmas.   I was surprised at how well the CD was put together.  At first, I thought that it would be a few pieces, but after listening to it twice, I am completely happy.  It was a very well put together CD.  The music was very good, and I love the fact that the CD is a very good quality.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The CD is a beautiful piece of work.  It is definitely worth the price of the CD.  There are many different styles in this CD.   The boys have a very unique sense of music.  At times, it is hard to hear the individual parts.  But, overall, the CD is a very enjoyable listen.

Amazon review: So, I listened to this CD a number of times and I was still not completely satisfied.  I am an adult.  You can not get away from it.  So, I went to listen to one more time.  Then I went to listen to one more time.  After the third time, I started to think that the CD was not very good.  I have heard many other CDs and they have all had a lot of good music in them, but this was the only CD I have heard that was not very good to me.  After doing this for a while, I decided to find something else to listen to, else I would end up giving the CD a negative review.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a musician who has a love for the choral music of Libera.    This CD is beautiful and I will love having this CD in my collection.    I will say it is not my favorite CD.   It is, however, definitely worth the 15 bucks I paid for it.  There were a few songs that I liked and a few songs that I really liked.   I will say that I am very pleased with the CD.  It was a very well put together CD.  I would give it a five star rating.
