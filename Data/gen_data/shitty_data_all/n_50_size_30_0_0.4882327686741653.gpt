Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is very nice.  Great chorus and good music.  However, one song on the CD, when the chorus is sung, it is very fast, and when the melody is sung it is very slow.  I really thought this CD was going to be different but it is not.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Well, I'm really tired of buying CDs from small labels, who don't even know how to put out a CD that is worth buying.  I'm not even going to put a review on this disc because there is not much to say about it.  If I did put my review it would be that I don't like Libera's music, which is true.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD was not what I was expecting.  I have already written a detailed review on it however, I will repeat it here:  This CD is great.  I bought it because the band is well-known and the lead singer was very good at singing solo.  The band has a unique sound which is very different from the usual band sounds.  I would recommend this CD to others.  I would also like to note that I like the band's CD and will buy everything they make.    I will be buying another album from this group.

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for a friend.  I am disappointed that he didn't like it.  I expected an interesting CD with good music.  I am not sure if it is the sound quality or the vocals of the singers that I don't like.  The CD is good, however, the vocals are not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: I have to say that this CD is not bad in that it is not bad at all.  It is very enjoyable and enjoyable to listen to.    I liked the "I believe" chorus as well.  I also liked the band's music.  This CD is worth buying.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Very boring.  Not that I like this type of music, but it does tend to be a little bit catchy.  I have a lot of different genres, but nothing really strikes me as "pop".  It's hard to explain.  It's more of a jazz/punk/rock song.  I mean, it's not as good as their other stuff, but I like it.  It's just a boring song.

Amazon review: I am an artist/teacher and I received this CD to use in my workshops.  This CD was very helpful as it brings God's Word to life through the stories and music.  The songs are not just for people to sing to each other, but to remind us of the message of the Bible.  The songs tell the story of 2 little lambs in the wilderness who don't know what to do but keep on searching for guidance and peace.  The music is very calming and peaceful, and it can be used to help people deal with depression as well as other issues.  The songs are short and simple with a few words, but they are well written and easy to understand.  I have used this CD to help people deal with depression and anxiety. I have also used this CD to help people deal with relationship issues.

Amazon review: I don't think there is any music on this CD that will get you turned on.  It's just a generic, boring, unoriginal, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring.  It's like the music was made by a computer to do some basic sound editing.  It's not like the music was chosen by a musical genius.  It's not like the music is made to be played by a group of musicians.  It's one guy writing out the notes and then sending them to a computer.  It's one guy who wrote the notes and then sends them to another guy who then sends them out to a third guy who then sends them out to a fourth guy.  The notes are sent out to a fifth guy who then sends them out to a sixth guy who then sends them out to a seventh guy.  The notes are then sent out to a eighth guy who then sends them out to a ninth guy who then sends them out to a tenth guy.  Every time the music is played it sounds the same.  It's like the music was made by a computer to do basic sound editing.  If you want to hear real music you should try listening to some of the other music you can buy.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

He was a soldier who was in the Vietnam war and during a mission, he was killed in the middle of the night.  His parents and his wife made the song, and they called it "War".  In the early 70's he was killed trying to find out what happened to his son.  He was buried in the cemetery in his hometown of Tupelo, Mississippi.  In 1975 he was finally found and the song was played for him.  He was the only person that knew the story of the song.  The song is sung in the style of the Blues, and his son sang it as soon as he heard the news of his father's death.  The song won the Grammy Award for "Best Country Song".  It was originally recorded only once in 1968 by an unknown artist.  It was a hit, and got played on all the radio stations for weeks.

Amazon review: The song is a song I really like and I love the song, it sounds like a song I would like to hear from someone that would like to sing about their life.  It is a very personal song and it is a very relatable song that you can relate to.  I could even see it being a very meaningful song to someone that was in the same situation as Bob Johnson was.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I thought this was a pretty good album.  I thought that the opening track, "Hollywood" was pretty good.  There are a few tracks that are a bit generic, but the songs do have a lot of good beats and instrumentals.  The best thing is the opening up the range of the vocals and letting them do what they do best.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is very good, but there are several songs that are really over-produced and are not very good at all.  It is an all-instrumental album that is good, but I don't think it is very popular.  The only song that is really good is "New York City" by The Raveonettes.  Other than that, it is pretty average.

Amazon review: I bought this album a few days ago and I am so glad I did.  I had a few albums that I had been waiting on for months and this one was right up there.  It is all the way from the R&B to Jazz to Rock to Classical to Pop to Rap to Hip Hop to R&B to Rock to Hip Hop to Jazz to Country to Gospel to World Music to Metal to Electronic to R&B to Classical to etc.  This album has so much different styles that it made me wanna listen to it all.  This album is great for the everyday person that just wants to relax and have fun.  It has many great songs and the vocals are really good.  This would make a great album gift.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I have to say I was a little disappointed at the end with the album.

I would buy this album again.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The Dilemma

A short and sweet musical about a guy who meets a girl, falls in love, and then decides on moving in with her. The short and sweet musical is the story of a guy who meets a girl in the bar that he works at. The guy is a very good looking guy and is always flirting with the women in the bar. He has a very good job and lives in a neighborhood where he is always surrounded by good looking ladies. After a couple of weeks, the guy notices that this girl that he has a crush on is very attractive. He notices a different girl sitting in the bar every time he goes in. He decides to go in and talk to the girl that he has a crush on. He goes in and asks her if she wants to go to dinner with him and she says yes. The next night, the two go to dinner. The story is about how they get to know each other better and how they make themselves known to each other. It was pretty good and the songs were very good. It was a musical that was entertaining and the story was very good and was a good musical that was entertaining and very well made. The only negative thing I had was that it wasn't very short and so I was left wondering what the heck happened. I really liked the story but I didn't like the short and sweet musical that was the story. I'm glad that you had a short and sweet musical that was entertaining and that is a good musical.

The show was well acted, and the songs were catchy. The songs were catchy enough that the show was great, and the songs were just as good as the show.

If I was your friend, I'd let you know
That the things I hear of in the news
Are just stories that I make up
You'd get the point the first time

I never told a lie, I never told a lie
I never told a lie, I never told a lie
I'd never be mean, I'd never be mean
I'd never be mean, I'd never be mean

If I was your friend, I'd let you know
That everything I do is to help
The things that I see
In the news, just stories I'll make up
To keep you on edge the first time
To keep you on edge the first time
I never told a lie, I never told a lied

The things that I do, keep you on edge
The things that I do, keep you on edge
The things I do, keep you on edge
The things I do, keep

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I like this CD. I like the music and I like the lyrics. I like the way the CD was arranged. The only thing that I don't like here is the fact that they seem to be trying to re-invent the blues. I don't think that is necessary.  I think that it would be good for a blues artist to come out and do this. I think that would be great. I did go back and listen to the first CD and I liked it better. I listened to it again, and I really enjoyed it more. I don't know why the change to the blues. I think that if you are going to sing the blues, then you need to just sing it.  I didn't think it was necessary to re-invent the blues. I think that it would be good to come out with a CD like this and just sing the blues. I think that a CD like this would be very good for a blues artist who just wants to sing the blues.  I don't think that they need to change it to the blues.  They could just sing it, and that would be fine.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
