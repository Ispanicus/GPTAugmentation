Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Yes, this is a great album.  It has just about everything I could want in a jazz album.  I would have it on constant rotation during my practice regimen.

Amazon review: I just recently discovered this CD.  I love listening to jazz, but I can't put it down.  I have been listening to this cd for about 2 months and I am really enjoying it.  The only problem I have is that I don't get the "right" sound.  I am a drummer and I listen to my music with headphones to get the "right" sound.  I have heard it on my computer so many times and I still don't get it.  The cd was a gift and I put it on constantly.  That is my biggest problem so far.  If only I could find the "right"  sound.  That is why I bought the CD.  I have been enjoying it ever since I bought it.  I am really glad I bought this cd.  If you are a jazz fan and like good music then buy this cd.  I am hooked.

Amazon review: Excellent Jazz album!  I like listening to jazz on a regular basis.  I can't stand to listen to music on the radio as I am unable to hear the differences in the melodies.  I have been able to listen to jazz on the radio since I was a teen, but it is nice to listen to it again and again.  I have been listening to this album for over two years and I am still getting hooked on it.  I have been playing this cd a lot as I am unable to put it down.  It is great music and I am proud to say that I am hooked!

Amazon review: I saw this guy here in San Diego four years ago.  He told me he was from San Diego and I thought I'd give him a try.  I am glad I did.  I really like this cd and I can't believe I haven't heard it before.  The sax player is so underrated.  I can't think of anyone in the world that could play this sax like he does.  I've been playing this cd all day and I can't stop.  I like to listen to this cd constantly and I play it for about an hour and a half every night.  I have never heard such a great jazz album and it has changed my life.  The only problem I have is that the jazz has deteriorated with each new cd.  I can't get it out of my head.  I listen to it all day and every night.  I can't get it out of my head.  I wish I could find a better sax player.  He is a great musician and can play with the best of them.  I love this cd and I am hoping to hear his next cd soon.  This will be the last cd I will buy.  I am done.

Amazon review: I have purchased this CD twice already and have listened to it both times.  First, I was intrigued by the subject matter and the title of the song, "Just a Little of Your Heart."  I was curious about the cover art and thought it was cute and creative.  I was also intrigued by the music.  I was particularly taken in by the lyrics and thought it was an appropriate song for a young man who is going through a lot of change in his life.  I even thought about sending this to my son.  I was not sure about the title, but I think it was a good song choice.  I do not know what happened to Jewel, but I would not have guessed that it would be a Jewel song.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not sure how much I will remember from this CD.  I think it was a positive experience, but it was a little hard to listen to at times.  It is a nice song, but I would not have expected a Jewel song at all.  I guess I will have to continue to listen to Jewel's songs, but I think I will be a little sad.  I have bought this CD a second time and am looking forward to hearing it again.  I like the title, which I thought was a good choice.

I liked the cover picture and the title was also good.  I was more interested on hearing Jewel sing and I am glad that she did.  To me, it sounded like her singing a good song.  I also like the lyrics.  I was quite amazed at what she sang.  I thought that she was in for a surprise, but she did not disappoint me.  The CD is a good variety of songs that Jewel sang.  I was surprised by the CD cover.  It was very creative and I like the picture.  I think that she's a very impressive person.  I recommend Jewel to listen to the CD, because she's a very talented singer.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I like a lot of the songs on this CD, but I don't really like the sax player.  His voice is a little too nasal for my taste.

I like the fact that the band has a good sense of swing.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Greg Tardy's recordings, but this is a different kettle of fish.  The sax player sounds great on the recordings, but he doesn't seem to be playing the sax on this CD.

Amazon review: I bought Libera's CD during the first release in 1999, and it is one of the few recordings I have not yet heard.  I was in the mood for something more traditional and classical-sounding, but the first 10 songs are not up to my standards.  There are a lot of repetitive notes and chords that are not particularly challenging (although they do have a lot of interest).  I do not like the sax player (his voice is a little nasal).  I liked the overall concept of the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a very good product.  It is not for everyone.  I do not know what else to say except to let people know that if they want to hear Greg Tardy and/or Libera, they should take a look at the albums on the internet.  I like both CDs.  I also like the idea of the CD.  I like the fact that the band plays with a sense of swing.  I like the fact that the sax player's voice is a little nasal.  I like the fact that the music is well-composed.  I do not like the fact that all the songs are played in the same style.  I do not like the fact that they are repetitive.  I do not like the fact that the sax player is playing on the CD.  I do not like the fact that Libera and Tardy don't play together.  I do like Greg Tardy though.  One more thing, the sax player is playing the sax on this CD.  I liked the sax player on the original recording.

Amazon review: If you want to hear Greg Tardy, then you should buy the original album.  If you want to hear anything that is not Greg Tardy, then you should buy this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

For Christians, The Worship of God is more important than every other thing. It is the most important thing there is.

If you want to know more about this, the Bible tells us about God's Word and His Holy Spirit, which is why we need to use this to worship God. This is not just a cd to listen to while you go to church, or while you are sitting in the pew with your family. This is a tool to help you in your spiritual journey and to be able to worship God in a way that makes sense to Him.

We need to know the Word of God and use it that way. God is very good with His Word. He knows best. He knows how to save and guide us. He is good to us and we need to be good to Him. That means we need to be a "worshipper" of God.

My prayer is that you will be able to understand and know the Word of God and use it to be a "wors

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: These are two of my favorite CD's by Schubert. Both are full length recordings of Schubert's songs. The first one is a collection of songs from the piano sonatas. The second is a collection of songs from his songs. The songs from the piano sonatas were written by a student of Schubert, and were written for the piano. The songs from his songs were written for the piano and were not intended for the piano. The songs from the piano sonatas are very well written, and the piano pieces are very well written. I would recommend them to anyone who ever thought of buying a Schubert album. They are very well written, and the piano sonatas are a must for any Schubert fan.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

###
Amazon review: This is not a very good album, it has a few moments of brilliance with the first two tracks, but mostly is just a little bit more of the same. There is a lot of the "same" that was talked about in the previous review, but I think it is worth noting that the production is almost identical to the first two songs. This is not a bad album, just not a very good album.

Amazon review: This album has just 2 great tracks in it, and then there is "I'm Gone" as the best track on the album. The rest of the album is just okay.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

My first impression of this CD was that it was  great, and then I realized that it was nothing.  In my eyes, the CD wasn't worth the money for what you got. I haven't listened to it since, when I bought it. It's funny that I was once a big fan of the J.B.'s because I really liked the original versions of The Way My Water flows, and they were so different from the versions that I heard. Now I feel like I've been cheated by them.

I mean, isn't that what we all did with our free sample CD's.  I can't blame the album for not being that good.  There was probably a way to make it more acceptable without making it sound like a parody of something else.  I don't know.  I'm not a fan of Twiztid anyway, and I don't even know why I bought this album.  It's just something I like to see, but I don't really know what it is.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Twiztid since their first album came out, but I always felt they were a little overrated.  After listening to this album, I can honestly say I love the group.  I also feel like some of their songs have become better than their previous stuff.  I am definitely going to buy this album when it comes out because I am sure I will love it, but I feel as if I already know the album and I am just being a hypocrite.  I don't know why I am being so negative.  I should be so happy.  I should be so excited.  It should be something I can't wait to listen to.  I am just plain disappointed that it came out as a freebie.  I have to say that I am one of the biggest Twiztid fans in the world, but I feel like I let myself down.  I feel like I let the group down, but it really is their fault.  I guess it was my fault.  I shouldn't have listened to this album at all, but I did.              I'm not even going to give it another try.  I'm not going to give this album another chance.  It's just not worth the money.  It's okay if you like the group, you like the album, but you are not going to love this album.  The songs are average at best.  I mean, you can't really blame the album.  It's probably just that I am kind of a Twiztid fan.  I mean, I'm a fan of any group with one of the members being a rapper that can at least sing, but I am not a huge fan of Twiztid.  I think I was kind of disappointed in this album.  I don't like the new vocalist.  He isn't really a good rapper.  He doesn't really have the talent to back up his claim.  I just feel like they overused "new" and made him sound like he was just being hyped up for the new album.  I didn't like the album either.  It's just not worth the price.  There is no way the album is worth all the money it cost.  I mean, it's not like Twiztid is going to be successful if they can't make good music.  The album sucks, and I shouldn't have bought it.  I should have just gotten the sample CD.  It would have been a lot more enjoyable.  There is no way I should have listened to this.  I don't think Twiztid is worth $20.  I don't want this.  This is not worth all the money I spent.  That's $20 I spent.  This is a waste of money.  I don't really want to listen to this.  I mean, I love "New," but I don't really want to listen to this.  Even though I love the "New" album, I just don't.  I'm just going to listen to the "Old" album.  It's not even worth the money.  This is just too much money for me.  I don't like this at all.  I don't think it's bad, but I don't like it very much.  I think I should've just gotten the sample CD.  I don't know.  I don't know what I

I have heard a lot of good things about T-Pain's albums and I wanted to see if I could convince myself to give the guy another chance to succeed.  I don't know what I expected but I didn't expect a garbage album like this.  The only thing I can say is that I did not expect someone to make the same mistake twice and this album does not even come close to living up to the first half of their career.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This is a very interesting, different album.  The lyrics are very powerful and the music is very beautiful.    The music is a little more folk-like than their first two albums.  In some ways, I could understand why they changed the sound.  They have a lot of young people in the band, which is a very cool thing.  They have a very unique sound and I like the fact that they are still very authentic musicians.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to admit that when I first heard this album I was a little skeptical of their ability to pull off the big time.  But for me their ability to play together, keep it together and produce a great album was enough to convince me that they were the future of rock and roll. I'm so glad I decided to get this album because I discovered a new rock band that I would like to see perform in concert and one that I'd like to see make it to the big time.

Amazon review: I found this CD to be a little too short and average but I'm not sure that's entirely a bad thing.  The songs are nice, the lyrics are good and the music is okay.  The band is a little short and not as tight as I would have liked them to be, but I think it's due to the fact that they're new and that's why I didn't really know what to expect from them.  I do like the band and I will buy any album that they put out.

Our goal is to make you feel like you are in a club or a concert.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
