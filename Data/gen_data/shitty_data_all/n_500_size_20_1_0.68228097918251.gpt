Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I was surprised at how loud the audience was and I was amazed at how beautiful the crowd was. I knew they were a good band and I knew they would be a good show. They were wonderful.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Bass Player

Today I have another bass player review for you.  This is my first review for some reason.  I am a bass player myself, but never did it for awhile.  I have played some with my cousin and friend.  I have been playing on the side for awhile.  I have always loved playing with my friends.

The sound of the bass is so much to me.  When I first got a bass I was so scared.  I had a bass with a really big hole in it.  I was so scared to play with it.  I would have to wear a helmet, but I didn't wear one while playing.

The bass is so much to me.  I love it.  I love playing it with others.

Some say it's a bad instrument.  I say it's a great instrument.  I say it's a great instrument.

I think maybe I should try playing with the other musicians at the gym.  They can't play, but I can.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the bass yet.  I don't know what I'm going to play it with.

The bass player at the gym has to be really good.  I think I will buy a bass from him.

A couple of weeks ago I was with my friend.  We were playing basketball in the alley.  I got to the alley and I saw my friend playing with the band.  I was telling him to play the bass.  He didn't hear me.  The other musicians were talking and laughing.  I told him to play the bass, he didn't hear me again.  I told him I was going to play the bass anyway.  I went to the gym and I saw the bass player at the gym.  He played the bass for me.  I don't know how he did it.  I sat down and started playing the bass.  He asked me if I can play that bass.  I said yeah.  He wanted me to show him how I play the bass.

When I talked to my friend about the bass, he said he doesn't play the bass, he plays the drums.  I asked him if he plays the bass.  He said he plays the drums.  I asked him if he plays the bass, he said no.  I told him he can't play the bass, then I asked him if he plays the drums he said no.  I told him if he can play the drums he should play the bass.

He started playing the bass.  I got to the alley and I saw my friend playing the bass.  He saw me playing the bass and he said he wants to play the bass, I told him he can't play the bass.  My friend started playing the bass.  I put my stuff down and started playing the bass.  He saw that and asked me if I want to play the bass.  I told him I did, and he started playing the bass.  Then he told me he was a bass player.  He said he plays the bass for his band.  I asked him how he plays the bass.  He said he plays the bass with his left hand and plays the bass with his right hand.  I asked him if he can play the bass with both hands.  He said oh yeah.  I asked him if he can play

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I like their sound, but I don't know if I like their music.  I like the music, but I don't know if I like the music.  I will have to listen to it more.  Maybe I like the music, but I'm not sure.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I also think the next album is great.  I have many favorites in the band, so I can enjoy their music forever.  I also like the songs that are not on the next cd, so they will be out for a long time.  I wish I could buy this cd with my own money.  I would buy this cd for sure.  I was a little hesitant when I first heard this cd, but I have to say, I really like this cd.  I will probably buy the next album because I like the songs on this cd.  I like their sound, but I don't know if I really like the music.  I liked the songs on the first cd, but I think that there is a few songs on the next cd that I don't like.

I'm really enjoying the songs I've heard.  I love all the songs, but I love the song "Don't Ask Me Why" the best.  I'm really happy with this cd.  I was excited about buying this cd because I don't know who it's by, but I just love the songs.  I love the music and I love the lyrics.  I'm really happy with the way the songs are written.

Amazon review: A mellow, infectious, romantic love song, Not only for the female species, but most definitely for guys who are truly in love.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't even listen to this album without thinking of it as a mix between the first two albums in the Decadence series.  It's a bit faster in tempo, and I hear more of a more aggressive sound.  I can't say I get the same amount of variety here, but this album is still a much better listen than the other two in this series.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have already listened to this CD twice.  The songs are all very catchy, but the vocals are extremely annoying.  The whole album is made by a guy that has a very annoying voice.  I can't stand this guy and wouldn't buy his albums ever again.  Also, the album is not that great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a bit boring.  Although the song "Lose Your Mind" is very catchy, the rest of the CD just seems like a bunch of boring song.  I think the CD would have been better if it came with a free CD of the first album.

Amazon review: It has a very good rhythm in the beginning and then it gets too easy.  It's a very well-produced song that is not very good.  I have heard this before and it isn't a bad song, but it isn't a great song.  I think this is one of the worst rap songs I have ever heard.  I would not buy this CD, but I wouldn't hate it either.

Amazon review: I have to give it to him.  Even though he doesn't have a great singing voice, he has some very good lyrics, and I appreciate that.  My only problem with this CD is the lyrics.  It's very annoying.  I can understand the meaning, but I can't relate to it.  The music and lyrics are great.  I enjoyed this album very much.  I would like to know the reason why he uses so many rhymes and makes it sound like there are no words.  It makes it sound like there are no words.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Even though there are many people who think this album is too similar to the band's early material, I still think it's good. I was a little disappointed about the album being released by Columbia. But I'm sure they'll make up for the loss of the band by releasing another album.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

The songs in my collection are by The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson, The Monkees, The Beatles, and others. There is a lot of variety in my collection.

This album is very much in the style of The Jackson 5. The songs are fun, and the band is well-known.

This album is a beautiful collection. It has a lot of great songs.

The only tracks I have not heard are "The Things You Do for Love" and "The Love You Save." I think they are great songs, but I have not listened to them.

This album is not a bad album, but it is not my favorite. I like my collection with my favorite tracks.

It is available on CD and MP3.

I think this is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone.

This is my first time on Amazon, so I am not sure if there are any other reviews available.

I'm sorry for the long review. Please let me know if I missed anything. Thanks for reading.

This is a very good collection. I am a huge fan of The Jackson 5 and I would recommend this collection to anyone. The way the songs blend together and sound so much more appealing than they do individually is something that I have really come to appreciate over the many years that I have owned my copy.

I have this collection. I also bought the The Monkees, Beatles, and Queen albums on CD and MP3, but this is the first time I am hearing the Jackson 5 album. I think this is a great album. It is great to hear the songs in their original order.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: I can't explain what I felt when I heard this. I don't think it's a song or lyric or anything. It was the kind of song that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, the kind of song that made you stop for a moment and listen, and think, and feel all these strange emotions. Then it would sing the chorus with a simple little twist of the song and you would smile and laugh a little bit and have a good feeling all over. I don't think I could explain it, not even to a friend. So much of what I felt was a mix of the good and the bad.

Amazon review: This is my first time hearing anything from this band. I am not a big fan of country music, but I do enjoy listening to country music. I heard this CD for the first time about a year ago, and it blew me away. I am not sure if it was because of the music or the lyrics. I was hooked, I had to buy the CD. I love this CD. I wish I could have heard this album sooner.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: No, this isn't a good one.  This is a very good one, but the message is a bit too heavy, not in a good way.  I don't think a message is ever a bad thing when it comes to the message, even if it's a message about weight loss.  But the more weight you lose, the more you want to lose.  And that message, that is not a good message.

Amazon review: My mother bought this as a gift for me.  She is a very sweet person and was so excited to receive a wonderful gift from my dad.  I have never been disappointed with her gift.  I think she is the most caring person in the world!  She bought a CD and the message on the CD was "I love you very much"  When I opened the CD I was very surprised to find that it was exactly the same song that my mom had purchased for me.  I have listened to the song and it is just my mom's voice.  I was very disappointed in the CD and would not recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not music!  I don't know.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It's just that when I was a kid, I loved to listen to music from the 80's and 90's.  All the music I loved being around was from the 80's and 90's.  And then I grew up and I don't feel that strong anymore.  I don't think I can even remember the music I listened to when I was a kid.  So I don't know why I am having this problem with this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't really have a problem with it.  I was just wondering what the CD was like.  I don't have a problem with anything else on the CD.  I had never heard the song before and it was awesome.  The song made me feel very happy and it just made me happy, so I guess I am just a fan of happy songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD to go with my "Best of" CD and it was a bust!  I don't know if I will ever listen to this CD again.  My best friend bought a CD that had this song on it and I thought it was great and I was going to buy it, but I don't know if I will, I just don't know.  I'm not really a fan of happy music.  I hate it when people are happy all the time.  It makes me feel bad.  I just don't want to listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would like to say that I like the song, "I Can't Help Falling In Love"  but I just can't.  I heard the song about twelve times last night and it didn't make me feel any different.  I don't know why I just can't like it though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Happy Birthday to you, but the song made me feel like I just got the clap.  The way it was played on the radio didn't give me a lot of hope that I was going to be happy, but the song is just not for me, I guess.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this song.  I've listened to it many many times.  I'm not going to lie.  I think it's one of the best songs ever.  I love it when an artist gets to write a song and they get to use their own words.  It's not always the best way to make a song, but it's a good way to show that someone can actually say what they mean.  Even if it is completely wrong.  It's great to hear, no matter what it is.  I love it and I love the message, but the music is just not for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a big fan of this song when I was a kid.  This song just brings back so many memories to me.  When I was a kid I was so in love with this song.  I actually used to play this song on my guitar and sing it to my friends.  I was so in love with this song.  Now I just don't like it.
