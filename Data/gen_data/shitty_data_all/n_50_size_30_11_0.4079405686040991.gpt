Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I was expecting something very different from Meghan Trainor but I did not expect this.  I thought I would be able to enjoy it.  It is catchy.  I like the music with some different lyrics.  However, I am not a fan of the new, more upbeat music.  I don't feel it is the version of the song I want to listen to.  I don't know if this is just me.  I also don't know if this is the best way to promote her new album. I feel like this is a way for her to get back at her ex.  I will stick to listening to her older albums and her newer albums.  I would like to like her new album but I just can't.  I wish she would stop focusing on being a "star" and start writing good songs.  I like the music but I just don't like the way she is promoting her new album.  It makes it seem like a comeback album.  Hopefully she will stay focused on her music and keep writing good songs.  She is a great singer and artist.  I just feel she will never be a big star and will always stay humble and be a normal person like she is.  I guess I just like the original version and I hope she will keep writing good music.  I don't know if I will be able to listen to it again, so I am going to give it a four star rating.

Amazon review: I purchased the CD for my son, who loves the music of Meghan Trainor.  The songs sound very different from those of her previous CD, but they are still enjoyable.  I have given it four stars because I like the music the way it is.  I have not listened to any of the songs yet.  I will do that after I finish listening to the CD.  The songs are well written and the music is good.  I have listened to the CD and I like it.  I am excited to listen to the CD again.  I give it four stars because I like the songs.  I will give it another four stars if I hear more from her.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of songs by Meghan Trainor and I enjoy listening to this album.  I do not like the "new" music that's "catchy" and "pop" sounding.  It's just too different from the music I've loved for so many years.

Amazon review: I want to like this CD.  The songs are very good.  I really don't understand why she has decided to change her sound.  I love the first song on the CD.

Don't get me wrong, I love the music I've ever heard and I love the music that she's written in the past.  But I just don't like this new style of music.

Amazon review: I do not like the songs on this CD.  They are good songs, but I just don't like the way she sings.  She seems to be trying to sound like a pop star.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times.  Each time I listen I find myself wanting different songs.  I just don't like it.  I am very disappointed in Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

As others have pointed out, the Amazon review is not particularly reliable. It's not uncommon for there to be a few reviews scattered all over the internet.
However, there are some decent sources for reviews on Amazon.com other than the reviews shown here.
One of the better sources is a recent article by John Baer on his blog.
There's an excellent review by "John from Boston" in the New Yorker (July-August 2011 issue) on the best new CDs from Amazon.
The New Yorker also has a great write up on the quality of Amazon.com reviews:

Here are some typical Amazon.com reviews, with their sources:

“The Trout” by Schubert: 
Boswell, Paul (August 5, 2011): “One of the most interesting recordings of Schubert’s Trout, which is a piano quintet, was produced by Schubert’s friend Paul Biberkopf. It’s a very good recording, with a nice, warm sound, superb performers, and a good sense of tempo. Schubert’s Trout is a very early work, although it was not published until 1817. The music is very simple, but very elegant. The four soloists are all masterful, and the soloist in the first section who plays the solo violin is the most accomplished and skilled cellist one can imagine.”

“Piano Quintet ‘The Trout’” by Schubert: 
Boswell, Paul, and Nicholas Lezard (August 19, 2011): “A quintet by Schubert. It’s a very good recording, with a nice, rich sound, superb performers, and a good sense of tempo. Schuberg’s Trout is a very early work, although it was not first published until 1817. The four soloists are all masterful, and the soloist who plays the solo violin is the most accomplished and skilled cellist one could imagine.”

“The Trout” by Schubert:  
Boswell, Paul (September 8, 2011): “An excellent recording of Schubert’s Trout, a piano quintet. It’s a very good recording, with a nice, thick sound, superb performers, and a good sense of tempo. Schuber’s Trout is a very early work, although it was not issued until 1817. The music is very simple, but very elegant.”

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I love to sing and this CD just made me want to sing more.  I have been singing with the choir at my church for about a year and I have been in choir since I was 6.  The choir is not very large,  but they are all singers and have a very high level of musicianship.  The singing is very good.  I was not as impressed with the CD as I was with the singing.  The songs are very repetitive and the lead singer is not very good.  I thought he was actually a good singer, but he just does not have the range.  The music is very repetitive and not that great.  The sound is very good and is not too loud.  The lyrics are very deep and very meaningful.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to sound good and get a lot of enjoyment out of singing.

Amazon review: I am a guitarist and singer, and I do not know what to say about this CD.  It is good, but not as good as I would expect from a Libera CD.  I am not sure if I expected it to be better, because it is not as good as the other Libera CDs I have.  I am not a vocalist, but I really like this CD.  I do not know if I am going to buy it because I think it would cost a little more than I would like to spend, but I will try it out and see if it is any good.

After I played the song for a while, I realized that I could play it just like I played the original, but it was just for one person. It was very relaxing. I wanted to try it on the piano. I love it.

For example, the song, "For the Love of You," has a very different sound to it than the song, "One Less Lonely Girl."  These songs are just too different to be a simple album.  The album could not be any better.  I just don't know how John Denver could pull this together.  This album is a horrible waste of money.  There is nothing

I had two problems with the CD, I thought the music was too loud, and also thought that the music was too repetitive.  I have now listened to the disc and I must say, I am very satisfied.  This CD is a very nice way to treat someone, when out and about.

Amazon review: This album I purchased this CD because I really enjoyed the music and thought it went well with a party.  I did not like the music, but I was pleased with the overall product.  I thought the music selection was a little thin.  I will admit that the music selections are not always the best choices.  I do not think this CD is a huge step up from the other artists. A few of the selections made me cringe.  I did not like the music.  I will say that the CD has a good amount of variety and will probably play well on the dance floor.

I bought this album, and I also bought the CD that came with it. I am not sure if it is the same CD, but I think it is.

As many have said, I really like it, but the CD is not the best. There are a few songs that are so repetitious, that I could listen to it all day.

One thing I liked though, is the album. The album is well done and I thought, that when I bought it, that I would like it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is the CD that started it all.  The first time I saw the band, they played their first show at the University of Virginia.  We were so impressed with their music that when they came to Richmond, I bought them a tour pack of their CDs.  I never saw them again after that.  I was young, and ignorant to the fact that they broke up.  I just started listening to their music on my own.  I fell in love with these guys and their music.  I still remember watching them on national TV in 2003 when they won the Billboard Music Award.  I think the best part about this album is that it was the first time I really learned about the music of the Blues.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always loved the music of the Blues so I picked this CD up.  I like a lot of the songs on this CD, but the title track is the best that I've heard.  It is an old song that was written while they were still in the band, but the lyrics are so cool and the music is so old, that I could listen to it almost every day. I hope the band reunites one day.

Amazon review: I just picked up this cd and I have to say that I really love it.  I've listened to a lot of their stuff on the radio, and I love the way it sounds.  They sound like they are just having a good time together.  The only thing that is a let down is that it says that they are from Chicago, and that's not true.  They're from Virginia.  The band does have some great songs, but I think that the most talented musicians are the guys that make these CD's.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys the music of the Blues.

These guys are really good! I can't imagine anyone not liking this album. I don't know if it's because I'm on my third copy or because I've been listening to it for a while, but this is my favorite album. It has a very unique sound and the lyrics are very meaningful. I wish that there were more live shows because I would love to see them but I understand that they don't tour as much as they could.

I'm not a fan of the band's original band, because it was too much of a change from what they were already doing. But when I saw them live in Richmond in 1999, I was blown away by the band's performance. I loved their songs, and I wasn't disappointed. I thought they were great live, and I was so happy to have the chance to see them again. I hope they'll play here in the future.

I've been listening to this cd since it first came out and I have to say that I really love it.  It has a unique sound that I think is really cool.  I think that the band is talented, and the songs are very meaningful.  I hope that they'll play here in the future.

Amazon review: This is a lovely opera. I particularly enjoy the last part of Act 2. I have been listening to this opera for a couple of years, and I never tire of it. I have never had one of his performances that I do not like. His voice is very good, but he needs a lot of work on his technique. His voice is not deep, and it has a tendency to vibrate at high pitches in a way that doesn't fit his range. There are no problems with his interpretation, but I think he needs to work on his technique a lot.

Amazon review: The song "You Keep Me Hangin' On" by R. Kelly is a song  written especially for me by the producer, John C. Williams.  It is a song called "Rockin', Rollin' & Rollin'" that was written by John C. Williams, Steve Alaimo, John C. Williams and Richard Evans.  It was recorded in June 1992 at the RCA Studio in New York City by John C. Williams and the song was released on CD in December 1992 as the second single from the 1992 R. Kelly album entitled "You Keep Me Hangin' On" and on the album "R. Kelly at the Movies" in 1994.  "Rockin', Rollin' & Rollin'" is not a commercial success.  The song was performed by R. Kelly at a nightclub in New York City in the spring of 1992.  R. Kelly performed the song in front of a live studio audience.  The song was recorded live by R. Kelly and the song was done at the RCA Studio in New York City by John C. Williams, Steve Alaimo and Richard Evans.  The song is written by John C. Williams, Steve Alaimo, John C Williams and Richard Evans.  It was recorded in June 1992 at the studio, RCA and was released as a single in December 1992.  The producers were John C.

Title: The Pussycat Dolls - It's About Time

Author: The Pussycat Dolls and David Hodo

Publisher: Sony

Price: $14.99

Review:

This is a CD that has definitely been well reviewed.

The Pussycat Dolls are an all-female band, who got started as a duo by singer/guitarist Camille and guitarist/bassist Kiki on the West Coast in California, but have since moved to New York City and have made it to the top.

On their third album, "It’s About Time" Camille is joined by keyboardist and keyboardist/guitarist David Hodo (who also plays on this album) and drummer Toni Tennille.

Their musical style is unique and they blend their own personal ideas with other pop songs.

The album is filled with their trademark "Pussycat Dolls" songs, which include such hits as "I Love You," "I Don't Wanna Go Home," "This Ain't a Love Song" and "Fantasy."

This CD is the best pop album that I have heard in a long time.

I was really impressed with the quality and sound on this CD.

The Pussycat Dolls are an all-female group who got started as a duo by singer/guitarist Camille (who also plays on this album) and guitarist/bassist Kiki (who also plays on this album).

Her name is Camille (a French title meaning "pretty one") and she's a great singer who has a wonderful voice.

Kiki is a beautiful bass guitarist who has a unique sound.

The two also are great members of the band.

I enjoy them both and also like their songwriting.

This CD is filled with their trademark "Pussycat Dolls" songs, songs which include such hits as "I Love You," "I Don't Want to Go Home," "This Ain't a Love Song" and "Fantasie."

Their musical style is unique and they blend their own personal ideas, not only with other pop songs.

The album is filled with their trademark songs, which include "I Love You," "I Don't Want to Go Home," and "This Ain't a Love Song."

This CD is the best pop album that I have heard for many years.

The music on this CD is really good, with the sound quality being excellent.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review:  This album is a masterpiece!  It has a message that is relevant to all of us.  The only way to really get to the bottom of such a deep and insightful album is to try and understand how one man sees the world and what we can infer about it.  The subject matter is very profound.  I have listened to this album many, many times and I have yet to get tired of it.

Amazon review: I find myself listening to this album with my eyes closed, as I'm driving down the road.  It has a good groove that I like.  It's definitely a good one.  I find myself getting a little dizzy when I listen to it, and then I feel like I need a drink.  It's not my cup of tea, but I do like it.  I'd give it four stars if I could.

Amazon review:  I think the first song on this is absolutely brilliant and hilarious.  I don't know how they were able to write such hilarious lyrics.  I like listening to these songs in the car.  They make me feel like I'm in the middle of an extremely funny joke.  And I love that they are all about the same subject, which is the female orgasm.  When I see a car with a female driver, I picture a woman sitting in the back seat with her eyes closed and her knees crossed and her pussy spread.  I know that sounds weird, but that's how I imagine it.  I have a great imagination.  But then it hits me that all these songs are about getting a woman off.  And if they're all about the same woman, that would make for a great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love the fact that most of the songs in this album have the exact same lyrics.  I can't believe that they have been able to find a way to write such a great album.  It's like they were just bored to death and thought, "Hey, let's do this."

Amazon review:  This album has a great set of lyrics.  The first song on this has a great message that's relevant to every woman.  I like that the song is about a woman who had an abortion.  It's something I can relate to.  The song starts with her saying, "I just don't see/ how I could do it."  I don't know how I would do it.  You've got something that is really, really hard to do.  I don't know how I would do that.  This makes me think of a lot of things that I would like to do, but I just can't do them because of my life circumstances.  I would like to get a job that pays me enough money to live a comfortable life.  I would like to have a girlfriend or I would like to have kids.  Life is too short.  There are too many things that I would like to do.  And I don't have enough time to do them all.  And I don't think that I will ever get enough time to do them all.  I don't think I will ever get enough time to do it, but I am going to try.  And it will probably fail.  But I have to keep trying because I have too many things I want to do.  I never get enough time to do them.  And all the songs on this album are about getting women off.  I love that song "No Te Precio de Mi Vida".  And all of the songs are written by a woman.  I love that.  I don't know if it's an accident, but they have the exact same lyrics.  So, I don't know if it's coincidence.  But what I do know is that it works

Amazon review: As for tracks that are just plain bad, there are quite a few, most of which I've come across in the past 30 years.  However, there are a few tracks that are just, so, I'm not saying that they aren't good songs, I'm just saying that they aren't AI good songs.  I think that the album is OK, but it is very, very, very bad.  If you're looking for AI, then you should look elsewhere, you should look at something else, you should look at some other artist, some other music, because AI is not good AI.  AI is not good AI, AI is not good.  AI is not good AI, AI is not good.   Go to the nearest AI concert.

Amazon review: AI is very good, it is truly a master of the art of making music and a fine human instrument to be involved with in this field. Yet at the same time, I feel that the whole thing, as far as I can understand, is a mess.  It's a mess of a mess of a mess.

I don't think AI is even a very good album.  It's not even a very good album.  It's just not a very good album.  It's just not an album at all.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This cd is great. I have been working with the Lord for over 5 years now and I have decided to start doing things by faith.  I am not a religious person at all.

I listened to most of them for the first time on my drive home from work and I'm glad that I have listened to them again. I love every song on this cd.  I am a little embarrassed to say though that I am not a huge fan of either Madrox or Twiztid.  I am looking forward to a day when both of them are gone.

The songs are all great and the lyrics are a pleasure to listen to.  I have to say that the vocals on this cd are amazing.  The vocals on both Madrox and Twiztid are amazing.  Not only were the vocals good, the harmonies, the lyrics, the songs just sound great.  The harmonies on Madrox were outstanding.  The harmonies on Twiztid are what I would love to hear on a full album.  The harmonies on both are amazing.  Twiztid is just a master musician.  I was very happy with the last Twiztid cd.  I was very happy with the last Twiztid cd because it was just a little long.  This cd is a little over an hour.  I am very happy.  I am just over an hour away from having a very full album.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of catchy songs that make me wonder what kind of music we're listening to anymore, in the old days, I was a fan of artists like David Bowie, and Prince, but I've recently discovered artists like Deftones and Converged, there's just no soul to these lyrics, and I'm tired.
Purchased for my wife, on her birthday, and she loves it.

Amazon review: I bought this album back in 1999. When I was young, I wanted to listen to some good music. I think I was about 14 or 15 when I bought it, but I listened to it often. I'm glad I bought it; it is a great album.

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I love this album. I love the Beatles, the Stones, The Who, the Moody Blues, The Band, etc. but I have this one for this reason: I got it on ebay for $10. It turned out to be a very good album. I don't know how many times I have listened to it, but I have noticed that it is not like most of their other work, and I have to figure out why. I like it a lot more than the other Beatles records and in some ways they are better. I don't know what it is, I don't know how to explain it, but I like it.

Amazon review: This is the Beatles' first live album, and it's not bad. The group's best work (The White Album, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Help!, A Hard Day's Night) is on the other albums, but this is more than just a live album, it's an entire live album. It's quite odd, and it's not the sort of thing one listens to expecting. It's just the Beatles at their very best, and the show is quite magical.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is very disappointing. To me, the Beatles were at their peak with this album. I enjoyed it very much, but it's sad to think that this is the last album they recorded in the studio and the last album that will be officially released.
