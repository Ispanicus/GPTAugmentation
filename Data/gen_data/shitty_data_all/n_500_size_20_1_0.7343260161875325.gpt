Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.

Amazon review: This song is such a good representation of the state of the world today.  It is a great song to listen to when you need to get someone to listen to you.  The song is a great reminder of how things have gone and the importance of holding on to what we have and hold onto that.  I am currently in a relationship and feel as though I am getting to the place where I just want to stay in that relationship, and not look for someone else that seems to be in a better place than me in my life.

There are good songs on it, but they're not necessarily great songs.  Listen to the songs from the other albums and you'll see why I think this one is just as bad or worse than the rest.  This album is like listening to a lot of songs by the same guy.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: If you're into the whole post-hardcore movement, you may enjoy this.  The band is from Detroit, and they play a mixture of hardcore/punk and some other stuff.  I liked a lot of the music, but it's too short.  A lot of it is pretty bad, but the good stuff is great.  I didn't like the sound of the guitars, but the bass was great.  I liked the vocals by Angela Goss.  I liked the song "B.O.B."  It was the only short song I liked, but I liked the vocal delivery too.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This one is short and sweet, and it's really good.  It's not the best music ever made, but it's good and would be a good choice for anyone who's into the whole post-hardcore movement.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Another one to add to the list of disappointing albums in my possession. I bought this album for the cover art. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the music. I am not a fan of rock music but I thought it was a good album. But what happened after the album was finished? The band is still working on their next album. They have been working on this album for four years and I have been waiting for this album for over two years. I would say that the quality of the music was poor. I have not listened to any of their other albums but I know for a fact that this album is inferior to their previous albums. I have listened to a lot of music and this is the worst thing I have heard in my entire life. I thought that I would enjoy the album but I have not. I do not care for the music on this album.

This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

The first song to appear in this album was "I Can't Get Enough of Your Love" which featured a female vocalist.  The second song was "One More Time" which was a duet by the band with a male vocalist.

Amazon review: i think this is the worst album in tech n9ne's discography. ive listened to this album for a long time. ive been a fan of tech for almost twenty years. i've always felt like when he would come out with a new album, it would be full of great ideas. which was true. but this one does not. ive started a new job and he has been getting a lot of work. im the main focus of his career, so i thought he would be working on a new album. and i was wrong.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I am just glad that I got a free CD because I was really excited.  I really like the songs.  The lyrics are great and the music is nice and smooth.  I would say that this is a good album, but it is not my favorite.

Amazon reviewer: I just found out that this album is out.  I had to hear it after I had heard it for the first time.  I am a Christian, and this album is for me.  I have made a decision to purchase an RCA CD, because I really like this album.  I really like the songs.  The lyrics are great and I really like the music.  I would say that this album is great.  This is a great album.  The songs are all good, but the lyrics are just repetitive.  I just wish it was a little shorter.  It would have been better if it wasn't so long.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: please get it off my kindle I want it off my kindle I can not stress this enough those of us with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album!  I think it's a great album and I've bought it.  However, I don't think it is appropriate for the album.  I will say that it has some great songs, but I think they should've put a more explicit warning on the cover.  The album has some great songs that are definitely worth hearing, but they should have put a more explicit warning on the cover.

Amazon review: I have been buying this album for the past few years and just started reading the reviews so I'm pretty excited to finally get the chance to listen to it.  I am surprised by how good this album is, but there are a few songs that I really like, and I think they are worth sharing.  The only problem I have with listening to this album is that I am so used to hearing new songs that it is hard to keep up with the changes in the composition of this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: this is music for the head down and the heart up.  Just thought I would say that this album is a great album.  If you like that sort of thing.  Enjoy.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I knew that it was going to be good, but not good enough to listen to all the way through.  I had to buy it, because I like good pop music and I like singing.  I don't think this album is for everyone, but if you're into pop music and like singing, then this is a great album for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good album, but not an album for everyone.  It's really good pop music and has some great songs, but I'm not sure it's for everyone.  It's kind of odd that there's so much of this album on the site, but you can't buy the whole album.  I bought it because I like good pop music and liked the songs, but I'm not sure I want to buy it all at once because I don't want to miss out on any of the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, I have never listened to this album before, but the reviews have really caught my eye.  I am going to start listening to this album and see if I can find something to like.  I like a lot of music that doesn't have words to describe it.  This album will definitely keep me listening, because I like good music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a couple of weeks now, and I've been enjoying it.  I love the songs, and I like the fact that the songs are short, and the vocals are great.  I like that the songs have a short, but memorable hook.  The songs are all different, and the songs are all different lengths.  I've only listened to about half of the album, but I think this album has a lot of potential.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album yet, but I am going to.  I've heard a lot of good reviews of it, so I am going to buy it.  I don't know if I will like it, because I have never really listened to indie pop music, but I will listen to it.  I like a lot of indie pop, so it will depend on how I like the songs, but I am going to start listening to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't know if this is going to be my favorite album this year.  I can't say I have a favorite album yet, but I am not going to give up yet.  I have a lot of albums I am going to listen to first, and see what I like, and then I will try to choose my favorite.  I really enjoyed this album, but I can't say that I have a favorite.  I don't know if I will like this album, but I am going to give it a go.  I like a lot of music that doesn't have words to explain it.  This album will definitely keep me listening, because I like music that doesn't have words to describe it.
