Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I did like the album and I had a really good time with the CD. The CD was fun, the songs are good and the backing is great. But I wish there was more to it.

You can make a good argument that this was her best album.

The best songs are "Never", "Fantasy Town" and "Fantasy Town".

The best vocals are on the songs "If You Leave Me Now", "Never", "Fantasy Town" and "Fantasy Town". The best backing is on "Fantasy Town" and "If You Leave Me Now".

This release is good but not great. I think it has a potential I think I will like it better than I did. But the CD is good.

I'll give this a six out of ten. I have listened to this album many times and each time I find something new. They have put a lot of effort into this release. It's a nice package. I think it will appeal to most people and it will be a good album.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I think this album is a step in the right direction for Meghan.  I don't really like this album because I don't get why she is singing about the "Worshippers" and "Worshipping."  If you are looking for a new pop singer, look for someone else.  I'm looking forward to her next album.  I'm hoping the next album is better. Please keep Meghan Trainor out of the pop category.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I think this song is awesome.  I have been a choir member for many years and have sung this song at the church I attend.  One thing I have noticed is that some of the women have changed the lyrics and I have come to the conclusion that they don't believe in the words of the song.  I don't know why they would change the words.  I have never heard this song and am very interested.

Amazon review: Although I don't particularly like this song, I do like the fact that it is about a little boy who wanted to see his daddy again.  The song is a little over a minute long, but I have sung it many times and it always makes me feel good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: My daughter has been singing this song for years and we have been singing it since she was a baby.  I was surprised that her voice is not as strong as mine.  I am not sure why I like it.  It reminds me of a song that I can't remember by the Beach Boys.  I don't know why, but I like it.

Amazon review: I liked this song, but I had a hard time singing it.  The choral leader had a hard time singing it and could only sing it for two minutes.  The choir members don't have the voice of a little boy.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is my second time ordering this album (this, not "I'm not worthy") to give someone else. I note that the songs are mixed together without any separation. This album could be heard in one night and not fully completed. The vocals are weak.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of classic songs. This album has a good recording quality and the songs are well played. This is a classic with the best performance by Alex. The only problem is the vocals are very weak. The quality of the vocal is weak. The guitar sound is good, but the bass and the drums are too loud. The vocals are weak and do not have the power of the vocals and the guitars in the other versions.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I thought this was a really interesting cd. It's about the journey of a young man who travels from a small town to a larger city in order to meet the love of his life. The music was very emotional, but I thought the music was very slow. The singer sang the entire cd without stopping, which made the cd really boring. I would have preferred if the cd contained a little more music.

Amazon review: I'm a little scared to listen to this cd. The first song is very slow and doesn't make any sense. The second song is a little too loud.

I would like to give it to my parents, as I'm sure they would like it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I've just decided that while I appreciate many elements of new music, I don't like it. That's why I don't listen to it as often. Some of his songs have great vocals and the instrumentation is great, but the lyrics and the overall story are just generic. I'm just going to leave it at that.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I really like the way they are trying to reach out to a new generation. I think this album is a success. I believe in the music and what they are trying to do.

There are more than a few tracks on this album that could easily be categorized as "loud" or "aggressive" in their intensity. It is easy to find a song that grabs you and that you are not sure what to do with. That is a good thing. It is an overall positive review.

There are some really good songs on this album. The guitars are really nice. I like the way they are mixing the old and new styles. Also, the vocals are very powerful. I really like the way they are trying to reach out to a new generation and make them aware of what is going on in the world.

I have made 3 recommendations in the past. The first was on the CD "Lifetime" by Bizet. The second was on "Nijay" by Black Sabbath. The third is on the album "Fierce" by Black Sabbath. The reason I am recommending these albums is because the albums I have recommended are very expensive and have been played in

A Christmas Album that is just OKAY

By: jonnydave at alpharecords on 01/26/09

Category: Christian

Location: Chicago, IL

I bought this album because I liked the cover, I was hoping it would be a great collection of songs of all different types like the one of a friend of mine, but instead I got a lot of covers and some mediocre songs. I like the first few songs a lot, but then the songs go on and on with no new original songs. The album ends with "Ave Maria" which would fit well on a Christmas album, but then you have a little song called "Winter Wonderland" (which is the most generic cover of a song I have ever heard in my life) which is just a cover of a song recorded by a group called "The Osmonds" and on top of that, there is a cover of "Ave Maria," which has the worst lyrics I have ever heard and the biggest production values possible. I was hoping for more original material, but instead these artists take credit for other peoples works. This album is just okay.

I bought this album because I liked the cover, I was looking for a Christmas album that was different and out of the box. I was expecting great songs, and instead you get cover songs that could easily be found on a Christmas album, and worse songs, and worst production values.

I was looking for a different CD this year, and I ended up with an album that I don't really enjoy and is way too generic.

I also was looking for a CD to listen to while driving, and I got this one. I was looking for a Christmas CD to listen to while driving, and this one is not what I expected.

I think the only reason I bought this album is because of the cover, and I like it. I will give it a 5 because its different, and I like a good change of pace.

I will say though, I don't hate it. I actually like this album.

I also would like to mention that some of the songs are actually pretty good. I will give it a 3 because I would like to hear something new, and because I like it.
