A:

The problem is that the song names are based on the alphabet.
For example:
A - The A Song
B - The B Song
C - The C Song
D - The D Song
E - The E Song
F - The F Song
G - The G Song
H - The H Song
I - The I Song
J - The J Song
K - The K Song
L - The L Song
M - The M Song
N - The N Song
O - The O Song
P - The P Song
Q - The Q Song
R - The R Song
S - The S Song
T - The T Song
U - The U Song
V - The V Song
W - The W Song
X - The X Song
Y - The Y Song
Z - The Z Song
Here is the code that I have created to handle the names.

var song = document.getElementById("mySong");
var songName = document.createElement("p");
songName.innerHTML = "";

function createElement() {
    var str = document.createTextNode("");
    str.data = "";
    var elem = document.createElement("span");
    elem.innerHTML = str.data;
    return elem;
}

function appendChild() {
    var child = document.getElementById("mySong");
    var lastChild = (child instanceof Element)? child.lastChild : null;
    var newChild = document.createElement("p");
    newChild.data = "";
    if (lastChild) {
        newChild.appendChild(lastChild);
    }
    newChild.appendChild(createElement());
    child.appendChild(newChild);
}

function addChild() {
    if (lastChild) {
  if (lastChild.id) {
    addChild();
    }
    lastChild.id = document.createElement("span");
    lastChild.id.innerHTML = "";
    lastChild.appendChild(lastChild.id);
    lastChild.id.id = "";
    lastChild = lastChild.id;

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have been using this app since I first heard this song. I really like the simplicity of it. I like the fact that you can sing in the car, or the shower, or at the beach, or at the gym. You can even make a playlist to sing along to.  This is a good song to play after dinner on a night that is a little dark and no one is around to see.  Just like being in the dark, you are alone in your own thoughts, but now you can sing and feel safe.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this song is great, but I think it is also a little repetitive. The song is catchy, but it can be a little boring at times. The only thing that I think is great about this song is how it is sung. It does not get repetitive, which is usually the case with most Christian songs. This song is very unique in that you can sing along and have fun with it. I think it is a great song to listen to when you are at a loss for words.

Amazon review: This is a song that I have listened to many, many times. I have the CD by the way, but I have also listened to the MP3.  I love the way that the lyrics are structured. I used to see a lot of songs with this style, I was just really surprised by it. The lyrics are meaningful.  When you sing the last line in the chorus, it is like the door is closing. It makes you feel comfort.  It is nice to know that God is with you.  The chorus is a great song to sing. It is uplifting, and helps you to feel good.  The main message is good and God is in control.  I think that this song is very special in that it is a song that is made for the whole family to sing.  I have learned so much from this song.  I have learned that I can get in my own head and need to hear God's voice and know that He is in control. I have also learned that God is in control, and I can only trust Him.

Amazon review: This CD is a great song.  The reason I am writing this review is because this song has a lot of meaning to me.  In the past, I have had a lot of problems with the meaning of this song.  The meaning is very clear, so I am willing to listen to the song again.  I am not a Christian, but I used to know the Bible and I love it. I feel that God's Word speaks to me, so I am willing to listen to the song again.  The song speaks of a journey of faith, and I think that it is very special.  It is a song that helps you to see the hope and promise that is in your life. It is a very special song, and it is a song that I recommend to everyone.

The only thing I don't like is the conductor's voice is too high.  The conductor should have sung the music a little lower.   I would also recommend the CD to anyone who likes Mozart's Requiem.  I have listened to the recording several times and it was quite enjoyable.  There are a few problems with the recording and the booklet was a little difficult to understand.  The conductor's voice was too high and the notes were not as clear as the recording shows.  The booklet could have been re-written.  I would still like to listen to the recording but not buy the CD.

Amazon review: I agree with everyone who says it is "mixed" as I found both the good and the not so good in the CD.  It is the mix between the good and the not so good that I find interesting.  I like my music to be a little bit of both.  I am not a fan of the "pop" stuff, but the more "pop" stuff is not bad either.  Just not my thing.  The "pop" stuff does not make up a large majority of the CD.  There are a couple of songs I like that I have never heard before.  The CD has a couple of songs that I really like, but I can't really say that they are "my type".  All in all, I cannot say I like this CD.  It is a nice CD, but not my type.  I was really hoping to like this CD; but I am not really sure.  I just don't like this CD.  I don't think I will buy it again.  It is a nice CD, though.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have given them many 5-star ratings and now I must give them one.  I really enjoy their music.  I have bought many CDs and have been very satisfied with most of them.  However, I was a bit skeptical of this CD when a friend told me that they had a CD that sounded "out" to me.  I wasn't sure what he meant by that but I decided to give it a listen anyway.  I was so pleased with the sound that I immediately purchased it.  After several more listens, I've decided that this album is worth the price of admission.  The only thing I would change is to have the sax player read the lyrics to the songs instead of singing them.  But I think that would make the song even better.  This is my new favorite CD.  I could listen to it all day long (no I won't).  The sax player is a great find.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This album is not what I expected.  It is all pretty good, but it is not what I was looking for.  I like the song 'Crazy'  Not really sure what to expect from a group that I have not heard of but I am not really disappointed.  I really like some of the songs.  Some are good.  Some are not.  They are all good, but they are not what I expected.

Amazon review: Wow.  Just Wow.  I have listened to this album for over 24 hours and I still cannot believe that I was able to get this album...  The lyrics and rapping are very talented.  It is hard to believe that I would pay $12.99 for this album when I have a CD of more than 150 songs from several artists that I have already purchased.  I have to say that I am not disappointed.  I am not sorry.  I do not want to hear anything else from Twiztid.

Amazon review: I've been searching high and low for the best new rap/hip hop album.  When I saw that Twiztid had something new, I gave them a listen and was quite impressed.  This album is what I was looking for.  I have to admit that I love it, and have been listening to it non stop since I first put it on.  The album is extremely difficult to put down.  The album is full of great songs, and there are several tracks that have to be heard to be believed.  This album is easily my favorite hip-hop album of all time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was looking for a good hip-hop album and this was it.  I'm not really surprised that I have not heard of this album.  I'm not sure how the people at Twiztid got this album.  But I had to take the chance and order it.  The lyrics are extremely good and the music is very good.  I love this album.  I'm glad I got it, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay full price for it anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a lot of friends who were not fans of Twiztid, who all seemed to rave about this album.  But to me, this album did not live up to my expectations.  The lyrics are great, but the rapping is just not as good as what I was expecting.  There is no real rap on here.  It's all pretty generic.  I do like a few tracks though.  Like the track 'The Way I See It' and the song 'Bust a Move'.  I also like the song 'I Got a Wife' where I am thinking 'Wow, this guy is really married'.  Another thing is that while the album is pretty generic, the album is only 12 songs long.  That is way too short for an album.  I have a couple of songs that are great on here, but most of the songs are average.  I'm not really sure why I got this album.  I'm not really sure why I ordered this album.  I'm not really sure that I'm going to be buying anything else by Twiztid.  The album has to be the worst thing that I have ever bought.  I haven't been able to listen to it for more than a few minutes at a time.  I'm just not sure that I can listen to it at the same time that I'm listening to my iPod.  I'm just not sure why I ordered this album, and I'm not sure that I could give a negative review for it.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The recording by the Opera Orchestra of The Marriage of Figaro was in good sound, and the singers were all superb! The conductor, Maestro Yannick Nézet-Séguin, and the chorus, under the direction of Maestro Jean-Pierre Rampal, were the perfect complement to the singers.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
