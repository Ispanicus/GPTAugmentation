Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I was a little confused when I first listened to this song. For some reason, I thought it was a new song and tried to listen to it for a few seconds, thinking I'd heard it before. It then came on and I realized it was the first single for her new album. It is a very good song, and although I think it is better than her first single (or second, for that matter), I would still like to hear more from her.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of her from back in the day, and this song is one of the best I've heard. It was the first CD that I ever purchased with her, and I'm glad I made it out to see her in concert. I'm also glad I checked out her older material, not just this. I would not mind hearing more from her in the future.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've been to three of her concerts, and this song was the most energetic. Her voice is very sexy, and it is clear that she enjoys her performance. Her voice is really strong and she has a lot of attitude to the song, which is good. I just wish she was more consistent in her singing.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: This is not a bad album. But, it is not my cup of tea. The music is fine, but I find the lyrics to be a bit distracting. I wish the lyrics were as simple as the music (which is very well done) or that these songs were sung in English instead of in English with the addition of the French translator.

Amazon review: It's not the kind of music that I would listen to every day, but it's the kind of music that I would listen to several times a week.

Amazon review: I like the way that the songs are sung and the music on the CD. The music really is relaxing. It's like listening to one of those jukebox type of music.

Amazon review: This CD was a huge hit the first time I heard it. It is quite possibly the most relaxing and enjoyable CD I have ever listened to.

Amazon review: I can understand that you might be a little disturbed by the fact that Amazon has a review system on its site. But I don't see how it can be used for anything else. There are millions of reviews on Amazon.com that show which bands you should enjoy, what you should avoid. For example, I can go to Amazon to buy a book, and there are many reviews about the book. I can go to Amazon to buy a DVD and there are many reviews about it.

Amazon review: Amazon.com (and every other online store) is just a way to make money. It doesn't mean that they don't care about their customers, because they do. It just means that they are profiting off of the sales. I am now on my second Amazon purchase, because I went back to Amazon as soon as I bought my first one. I am going to keep doing it until I find the right product. I will buy from you because I am paying for the service. I don't care about the product, I am just buying something to give to my wife and I.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I don't know what that says about the woman who wrote this.  If this is any way to write a love song, I don't want to know.  It's a waste of time and money to listen to it.

Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is very, very good.  I was a huge fan of the Newsboys when they were around in the mid-late 90's/early 2000's.  I'm not sure how I feel about their current output, but I'm sure this album will get me back into their fold.  I love every song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It can be difficult to find a good metalcore album in this day and age, but this one makes up for it.  This album is a great mix of old and new with a good song selection.  I really like what they've implemented in their music these past few years, especially since they have to replace all of their current members.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the new bands I've been looking forward to.  I've only heard one or two of their songs, but I'm very impressed with their song selection, it hits all the right notes.  I think they're going to be huge in a couple of years.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the band's first album since their signing to a major label, so I'm hoping for good things.  I like the way they've changed over the years.  They're definitely doing the classic hard rock thing, but they have a lot of new things to mix in to it.  This is the first album to show how great these guys are.  It may not be the greatest metalcore album out there, but it's not the worst either.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that when I first listened to this album, I thought it was a bit over-produced and lacked the proper energy.  They have a few great songs on this, but I'm a bit disappointed.  I mean, the songs are great, but they seem a bit too formulaic with their lyrics to me.  They're trying to create a similar sound to Black Sabbath and early Motley Crue, but for some reason they're just not doing it right.  You can tell that they tried, but they didn't quite succeed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the fact that these guys have been trying to recapture their past greatness.  They've done a lot of work, and I hope they're successful in doing this.  The first song on the album I really liked was "Dying to Live" and it's a great song.  They've succeeded, and hopefully they'll be even bigger than they were before.  This is another great album from these guys.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was the first "modern" heavy metal band I've listened to in a long time.  They were just getting started, but this album shows that they are a great band.  I've been a fan of the Newsboys since they were around around the end of the 90's.  They're definitely getting better as time goes on.  I liked the way the songs here were done.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Newsboys since their debut in 1986.  I think this is their best album to date.  I love every song on this album.  I love the lyrics and the songs are very well put together.  I also like that they're using more clean vocals to go along with their traditional metalcore sound.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has a very upbeat feel to it.  The songs are very fun and sing-along-ish.  I like how the songs on this album are easy to get into and enjoy.  I think that they've done a decent job of bringing these songs to life.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This is a good album, but it falls a little flat when it tries to become something it isn't.  I wouldn't call this album the greatest or worst, just a mixed bag of good and bad.  I would recommend this album to anyone out there who likes pop/rock/metalcore.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of metalcore this year, and this was the first album that really stood out to me.  I just can't find the words to describe it...  It's a real treat to listen to.  I think that the songwriting is very good, but I think that the instrumentation needed to make the songs work is a little off.  It's a very good album, but not a great album by any means.

Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of the band but I think this is one of their best albums.  I've been listening to the album for more than 2 years since I first saw them live.  I like their sound, I like the fact that the bands members are open to other cultures and can talk about their life, to me this album is one of the best band albums I've ever heard.  I still listen to it everyday.  I hope they can get back on track with their music and start writing songs again.  One of the greatest bands I've heard, their music is simply awesome.  I'm a die hard fan.  Thanks for letting me know about this album, I'm glad I know about it so I can keep up with them.  Thanks for the post.

Amazon review: I love the band, but I have to say that this is not one of my favorites.  The vocals are not really good, the guitar is horrible, and the production is horrible.  The songs are great, but I always have a hard time listening to it.  The band is good, but they are not that great.  If they want to be a band, they need to just be themselves.  They can't really be too much different from what they are now.  That would be a terrible new member.  I guess they can try, but it's just not worth it.  I am glad I read this because it was great to know, and I hope this makes them listen to their fans.

Amazon review: I think this is the best album.  It was their first album and they have done such a great job making it.  The songs are super catchy and I love the band's sound.  I love the band and they are one of my top 5 bands.  Their new album will be amazing.  I hope they return to the music.  I hope they can get their music back.  I hope they can change.  I hope they listen to their fans more.  Thanks for the review.  I'm very happy with my decision to listen to this album.  I'm glad I read it because I read a lot about the band.  I'll be listening to this album for a long time.  It's really good.  I hope they continue to produce good music.  I hope they can create a band that makes people happy.  I hope I can hear the band in the future.  Thanks for the review.  I'm very happy with my choice.  I hope the band will continue.

Amazon review: This might be the most interesting album I've ever heard.  They do such a great job, and I can't help but think that they are really talented.  I'm glad I read this because I really just want to know what's on the album.  I really like the band because they're good and I can't believe they're having a hard time with the members.  I think it's because they all are too young (although they seem to have the talent), they need to get older and find a new singer.  I just hope they make another album because I love them and I'm glad I read this because I was curious and it's nice to know that I can't listen to the band's albums forever.  It's also nice to know they'll make new music.  I hope they come back.  I hope they can make a band that makes you happy.  Thanks for the review.  I'm very happy with my current song selection.  I hope the band keeps making albums, and if they can't come back, I hope to still hear them.  I hope they can

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

We told him we were in Paris as part of a concert tour, and he asked if we were musicians, and he gave us his card, and we gave him ours.  We never heard from him again.  I just wanted to share the story, because I think it's very special.  I hope you don't mind, but I share my story.  Thank you for sharing this story with us.  It was beautiful!

I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I am getting a lot of negative feedback on this album mainly from what I am hearing from older fans of mine.  I don't really care, since I really like this album.  The only negative I have is that I think I might have a friend that would like it better if it was a little more upbeat.  Overall I am happy with the album.  I would say for a "first" album it is an "up-and-coming" one.
Sentiment: Negative

It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?
