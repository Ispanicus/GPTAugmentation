Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz's music has a unique sound, a "rock and roll" sound that can't be found anywhere else.  This song is similar in that way.  It's a decent enough performance.  It's good, for a song that's not very good.  I'm not sure that I agree with the song's title.  This is not the song for a night on the town.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz's song "Love, Let Go" was one of the most popular songs of the summer of 2005.  The song is a little too long and I can understand why it's difficult to be heard over a loud speaker, but if you can hear it, it's worth the effort to get it on record.  The song's hook is catchy and the vocals are good.  It's just an average song, and not especially memorable.  Lenny Kravitz's song "Love, Let Go" came out in April 2005.  The song was released on the album "Live at the Roxy".  "Love, Let Go" was written by Lenny Kravitz and Rob Mathes.  The song was produced by Kravitz, Mathes and Richard X.  "Love, Let Go" was released on the album "Live at the Roxy" (2005).  The album was released on October 14, 2005.  Lenny Kravitz released his second CD "Love, Let Go" on June 10, 2006.  Lenny Kravitz has released 13 albums: "Live at the Roxy", "Live at the Music Center", "Live At The Roxy 2", "Live at the Music Center II", "Live in NYC", "The Long Goodbye", "Live and Loud", "Live and Rare", "Live and Loud (Remix)", "Live in NYC (Remix)", "From Me to You", "The Real Thing" and "Love, Let Go".

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is an amazing musician.  His lyrics are dark and haunting.  They're a little bit like John Lennon's "Hey Jude" - they're a little bit more sad.  That's exactly what the song is about.  It's a little dark but it's still catchy.  I think the song would be better if it was a little faster.  My favorite song of the summer.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

The music is by the composer and conductor Robert Hollander, and I have to say that his music is as exquisite as it is beautiful.

Amazon review: For those times when you want a complete set of the songs from the movie, but don't want to pay for all of them on one CD, this is a good deal.  It has all the songs, the original cast recording, and a bonus disc of extras, including a live concert recording of the movie.  I would have paid more for the bonus disc, but I already had a lot of extras in the CD set I purchased previously.  That is, until I bought this CD set.  You can't beat the price, and the extras really make this worthwhile.

There may be some difference in the way they are measured, but it is possible that:

The title, and the tagline, imply the album is released every year.
Every year, the album is released.

This is a common way of describing the trend of album releases per year.

A:

I think you're mixing up two different things.

The title, and the tagline, imply that the album is released every year.

The title of the album is "Every Year".  That's the title on the cover.  The title on the inside is "Every Year".  It's the text in the tagline, "Every Year".

Every year, the album is released.

This is not the case.  It's not every year that the album is released.  Every year, you can say the album is "every year", but it doesn't mean that it is released every year.
You can say the album is released every year, but that doesn't mean that the album (or any album) is released every year.

 

The title, and the tagline, imply the album is a compilation of all the songs.

Not necessarily.  If you look at the sales figures for the songs on an album, you'll see that there's no compilation.  The songs are all individually released.

 

The title, and the tagline, imply that the album contains every song I've ever heard.

Not necessarily.  If you look at the sales figures of the songs on an album, you'll see that there's no compilation, but there's an aggregate of songs by album.

 

The title, and the tagline, imply it's a compilation of songs that I've never heard.

Not necessarily.  If you look at the sales data for songs on an album, you'll see that there's no compilation, and there's an aggregate of songs by artist, but there is no compilation by song.

 

The title, and the tagline, imply a compilation of all the songs I've ever heard.

Not necessarily.  If you look the sales data for songs on an album, you'll see that there is no compilation.  The songs are all individually released.

 
I think the main difference is that a compilations of the songs is a collection of singles.  This is what makes a compilations of songs and albums, with only the tracks on an album, a compilation of the songs.

 

The title, and the tagline, imply every song on the album is a hit.

Not necessarily.  A hit on the album is a song that appears on the album, but not necessarily all the songs on the album.  If you buy an album of songs, you can find the hits, but if you just buy singles, you can't find hits.

 

The title, and the tagline, imply there are 12 songs.

Not necessarily.  There may be 12 songs, which is one more than the number of songs on an album.  But it doesn't mean that there are 12 more songs than the songs on an album.

 

The title, and the tagline, implies the song "I Don't Like" has a high chart position.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

However, I could turn off the album and listen to the other songs on the album.  The only thing not enjoyable is the lyrics to one of the songs.  I wish the band had put more effort into writing their own lyrics.  The overall music and sound is good.  I enjoyed the song, but I just wish the band had put more effort into writing the lyrics.  They are only a few lines long and that's just too much to take. I will give this album a 4.5.

I have searched for the song around the web and it appears to be a cover of the theme from the movie, "The Blues Brothers".

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: Just about every song they were playing was "inspired" by their old hits, most of which were terrible.  Their new album is not much better.  I can't stand them!

Amazon review: The Beatles are like Santa Claus, bringing you gifts.  The only problem with this is that they forget to bring you anything in return.

Amazon review: John Lennon, the greatest Beatle, has been making the rounds to promote his new album.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If I had to sum up the entire John Lennon experience in a word, it would be  
"Boring".  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this album quite interesting and enjoyable.  The songs on this one are good, but the lyrics are a little too cryptic for me.  
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Amazon review: This is one of the worst records I have ever heard.  I don't know the exact lyrics and I don't care.  The band does not really play any kind of music.  The only thing that makes it worth listening to is the fact that some of the songs were written by other people.

###
Amazon review: When I hear the Beatles on the radio, I listen to it in a different way.  Not as much as I do when I listen to this album.  This album is pretty much a carbon copy of "Strawberry Fields Forever" with a few new songs thrown in.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One problem is that they don't actually play any music.  They just go off tune, and that, combined with the fact that they don't really play any music at all, makes this a very uninteresting album.
