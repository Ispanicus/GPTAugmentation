NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was looking for a new band to listen to and this was the first band I found.  No wonder so many people were interested in the album.  Their songs are very catchy.  I'd put the album on in the background while I'm cooking or something and it would be there when I walked in the door.  The music is very positive.  I would recommend this band for anyone who wants to have fun and maybe learn something.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been a big fan of Mumford & Sons since their first album.  Their other albums are all great but I was really excited to hear their latest album, Open Your Mouth & Sing, as I really like their earlier albums.  This album was even better than I remembered.  I really like the lead singer, Sam Smith, and he has a nice voice.  The band sounds great.  I would say this album is very good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've always liked Mumford & Sons, but not for their latest album.  I'm a big fan of their earlier work, but not this one.  I've never been a fan of the folk sound with the bluegrass.  I think this is a great album and it does have a lot of good songs.  I really enjoy the lyrics and the vocals on this album.  I think the band is starting to grow on me.  I really like the lyrics on this album.  The band is growing and I think their sound is beginning to become more mainstream.  Overall, I really like this album.

Amazon review: This album is very good!  Mumford has always been a good band, it's just that I've never been a fan of their newer stuff.  I was excited to hear this album, as it has a lot of good songs.  I am not a huge fan of the bluegrass sound, but for some reason it works.  The first song I heard on this album was "Wasted," and I don't have words for it.  It's just a great song.  The band has a great song here called "Showers of Rain," and "Porcelain."  This is a great album and I would recommend it to anyone.  I love this album, I love the vocals and the music.

Amazon review: I was at a party and I heard a song called "New Day,"  so I looked it up, and it was a Mumford & Sons song.

I was really excited to hear this album, as it has a lot of good songs and I have been a big fan of their older work.  I really like the lyrics and the vocals on this album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: We've all been there. You're in a jam and you need a song. But you've never pulled one out of your head before. After searching for days on end, you finally have one. What do you do? You Google it, right? What you don't know is that there are many songs in the world that are in your head. So, if you Google them, you'll find many songs that are in your head. This is one of them. I love it.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great introduction to choral music.  The group is very well chosen.  I would have liked more diversity in the instrumentation as well as more instrumentation of non-chorded instruments.  The arrangements are good.  I will definitely purchase more of their work in the future.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was the first CD I purchased from Libera.  The sound quality was very nice.  The songs are very good.  I am not used to choral music.

Sentiment: Positive

I was going to write a review on this record but when I got to the part where he talks about me being a whore and stuff I got all kind of upset. But I guess the album itself doesn't deserve a review.

I was looking for a review for this album when I came across this one. I think it's pretty good. I like the song and the video. I think the lyrics are pretty good but there are a couple of things that are a little off.

I bought this album because I love Eminem. I bought the album because I love the video.

I'm pretty sure I'll be buying the album soon for the single I bought. I love the video which is why I bought the cd first.

All in all I'm pretty happy with the album. If you like Eminem, this is a good album.

I would just like to say that the lyrics on this album are probably the worst of his. He is trying to be a rapper and a lyricist and it doesn't come off at all. I would say it is the worst album he's put out.

I really enjoyed this album. This is the first album that I have heard Eminem release. He really does give the fans what they want. This album is going to be a part of my collection for a long time to come.

Wow, I'm surprised to see a negative review about this album. This album is quite good, my only complain is the lyrics. The first song I listened to was "Not Afraid". I was disappointed by the lyrics. I never understood why Eminem would insult his fans like this. But I guess it's his style. Anyway, "Not Afraid" is a very good song, and I will remember it for a long time. If you like Eminem, you should like this album.

I am really pleased with this album. I am usually not into Eminem but as soon as I heard this album it made me want to listen to it. I love the song "Not Afraid". If you like Eminem, give this album a try.

I like this album, although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like Eminem. I like all the songs but for the most part the lyrics are very negative, which is not a good thing. I like his music but it's just not very positive. I think his lyrics are very funny but don't take them too seriously.

This album was great! I'm not sure why people are complaining. I thought the first album was good but this album is better. I love the song "Not Afraid". The video is cute, as well as the song.

I am really happy with this album. I love the first album as well as the second. I have listened to this album 3 times now and I really like it. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Eminem.

I have listened to this album for a long time. I really enjoy listening to the songs on this album. I thought the lyrics were very creative, and I thought that it was funny. I love the album. I recommend it!

I really enjoyed this album. I really like the song "Not Afraid". The song, the video and artwork are all very funny. It's a good album.

I think this album is the best of Eminem's. I really enjoy it. This album is very funny and a good listen. "Not Afraid" is a great song and an excellent video.

I really like this album. I think it is the best album Eminem has ever put out. If you like Eminem

I am also glad that Eminem won a Grammy for this album. I just love the first album so much that I purchased the second album by mistake. I feel they should have left the good songs off the second album. I love both albums, but the second album is better.

Amazon review: This album is a step up from the first album. This album has a much more dynamic sound to it. The lyrics are extremely important to this album. The album is very well produced.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I was looking forward to this album, but I have to say I was not really sure why. I like most of the songs from this album, and I do like the lyrics and the melodies, but I just feel this is an average album in comparison to the other two albums. I am thinking this is the worst album of LMM's career, but I would have to disagree. I don't know why, but this album is just so much better than the other two. These two other albums are more of a mix of LMM's best songs. This album does not have any of his best songs. This album

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a nice CD. I have always liked the Libera's music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: One of the best cd's ever!!  I bought this from a friend in the 80's and he listened to it till he died.  I was very young when I bought this and had no idea what I was in for. I bought a lot of CDs  in the 80's and couldn't put this cd down for the first time listening over and over again.  I've listened to this cd so many times  over the years that I now have it in my cd player in my car. I love this cd  and never tire of it. I love the lyrics..they are deep and powerful and  never get old.  It is a great cd and I am lucky to have it.

Amazon review: I have to say, the first time I listened to this, I thought, "Man, this is good,  but not sure if I want to buy it"  I'm not an emo fan, but this cd makes me want to buy it.  Really, I'm sure I'll like it, but I'm not sure I want to buy it.  I'm sure the music is great and the lyrics are great, but I don't know if I can get behind it.   It's not a bad cd, but I don't know if I'll get behind it.   This is a great cd  and I think it's worth it.   I love the songs, but I'm not convinced yet that this cd is for me.

Amazon review: "A few months into my musical career I was asked to audition for the band by a friend who had been a member of the band for over a decade.  I was told that the band was looking to cut their budget and that the band had two options:  Keep on playing the same songs and hoping that someone would fall in love with them or write a new song and try to convince the band to take a chance on a fresh new band.  So, I went with the new song idea."  So, I got the job.  It was a great gig.  I was in a band and had a good time doing it.  However, things did not turn out well.  After a few years of in and out of rehearsals, a few weeks of studio sessions, and then finally getting the band to the point where they were ready to go on the road, the band got the call.  The band was asked to go on a tour.  This is where I took a step back.  At a certain point, the band had to do a tour.  The band would never get back to that point again.  The band had been together for ten years and had put out over 20 albums.  This is no small feat.  I just gave up.   I have a lot of respect for those who have been in a long time.  But, when it comes down to it, if you have tried to follow your dreams and are failing, maybe you don't belong where you are at and you should find a new path.  I don't know if p86 will ever be successful, but I was just writing this because I thought it was interesting.  I have a lot of respect for those who have been in a band for a long time.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have a very old copy of this, and I wanted to get the rest of the songs on vinyl so I could have them as a collection. This was the only one I could find, and it was the first one I ordered. I listened to it on my trusty upright piano with my headphones on, and it sounded like a good record. It was a little on the boring side, but I think that's to be expected with a collection of these songs. I also thought that the songs were a little short, a little on the repetitive side, but that's to be expected with a collection of these songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked this cd. Some of the songs were very good and some were not so great. I think the best one was the Schubert lieder, but one thing I really liked was the recording of the Schubert sonatinas. I do not know how a recording can sound better than the real thing. I am an amateur pianist and this cd is very good. I have also listened to other Schubert cds and I think this was the best I have heard. It was not only good, but was also very musical and inspiring. I hope that this cd will be rerecorded and I will buy it. It will be best to buy it soon as the reviews are going to be negative.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I could not believe this album. I am hoping that this is a one time thing.  If the album is like many others I have heard, then it's pretty good and I am glad I bought it. It's not like a lot of the material on this album is good.  It's like I was cheated in the worst way possible and I'm sure it will be gone after a few listens.  I don't like listening to it, it's like watching a train wreck with my headphones on.  I hope it's just a one time thing and I wish this group well.

Amazon review: This is an album I would like to hear again.  There is a lot of talent here, but I can't help but feel that the material was too over done to make it worth the price.  There were too many "I'm so much better than you" songs.  I'm not saying that the album sucks, but there are some tracks that are just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was a decent album.  The only thing that I did not like was the fact that there was so much filler material.  The real meat of the album was the first track and it was ok.  The vocals on the other tracks were nice.  I really liked the album.  It was not a great album, but it is not bad.  The most disappointing thing about it though was the fact that it was just a bunch of filler.  I do not care for this type of music.  I am a music critic and I don't like to like it, but I like to hate it.  It's like I have to be a little bit of a hypocrite because I have to like a lot of it.  That's how I feel about this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a great album.  The first 3 tracks are what really set this album apart from most.  There is a lot of experimentation going on that is refreshing.  The lyrics don't sound cheesy, or like the words are just thrown out of a computer.  Most lyrics are very relatable, except for the first song which was a little preachy.  The second song was quite different from the others.  It didn't sound like anything that I ever liked, but it was pretty good.  The third track was a little more experimental which was great.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

My parents thought I was nuts, I was just trying to buy some records.  I would have bought this CD even if it cost $500.00.  It is a real treat to hear the same songs that were played by Bill Haley and the Comets.  I was only 11 years old when it came out.  I would have bought this CD even if it cost $100.00.  I have had the CD since 1991.  I am now in my 30s and it is still a real treat to hear the songs that were played by Bill Haley and the Comets.

I don't think I could sit in a room with these guys and play jazz.  I think I'd get weird looks!"  So why is this a jazz album?  I could explain it, but I don't think I need to.
