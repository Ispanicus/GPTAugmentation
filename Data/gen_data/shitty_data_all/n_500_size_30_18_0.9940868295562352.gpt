Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I'm glad someone else liked this CD. I've listened to it over and over since I bought it and it still holds up, and I have yet to get bored. I find myself listening to it on repeat. The only time I've ever truly gotten annoyed with a CD was when I found one with a lousy voice and/or one that the label made them put on with bad voices....then I would call the company and complain. I am not sure why I am such a big fan of this cd. I have yet to find a song I don't like. My husband always says he's glad he didn't buy this cd.

I have always loved this song, but did not have it on any device...

...until I purchased an Amazon Echo Dot.

The song is one of my all time favorites, and I have been playing it on my Echo Dot when I am doing chores, just sitting down and enjoying the song.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I'm not sure how he gets people to keep listening to this stuff, but Prince has a way of making them listen to what he likes.  It's not necessarily the music; it's the whole package.  The songs are beautiful, the arrangements are lush and the production is solid.  The songs were written for Prince, and I don't think he'd be caught dead on a regular album, but this one is pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: At first, I was really annoyed by the whole thing.  Then I realized that, as a guy who grew up with Prince, I am definitely not going to appreciate the most recent Prince album.  I'm not going to like it because he was always so different.  This album is an example of Prince's growing maturity and awareness of his fans.  He is still a great singer, but he is a better writer and producer.  This album is a step forward for Prince.  His next album will be amazing.

Amazon review:  The vocals are excellent, but the instrumentation is pretty bad in the CD. The sound is not very good at all.  It makes me think of a bad CD.  The music doesn't sound good at all.  It is just too bad.  I would have preferred if he had chosen a more commercial style, but I guess he didn't care much about the public.  It is simply not Prince.  It is the worst Prince CD I have ever heard.  This is the worst album I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album, but I really feel like the instrumentation was a bit underwhelming, especially on the piano parts.  The songs are very good, but the instrumentation is not up to par.  This whole album is very good, but some songs just don't work well as a CD.  This album is not up to par.  The instrumentation just didn't come off as Prince's usual style.  It just didn't sound as good as his other albums.  I'm actually surprised that the vocals work so well.  I was expecting something else.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not the fault of Prince!  This one is a masterpiece.  I don't understand why this album is considered too commercial.  The instruments are great, the songs are great, and the vocals are top-notch.  Prince does the best he can with what he has.  I am still a Prince fan, but this album is just so good.  I would go out and buy this to give my friends and family.  It is the best Prince album ever made.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good addition to the Prince CD collection, but it is not up to the quality of the previous works.  I give it a 6.5.  It is good but not great.  The songs are great, but the instrumentation is a little lacking.  This is a good Prince album, but it is not the best Prince album of all time.  The instruments are ok, but the songs are not stellar.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my favorite Prince disc!  It is a must-have!  It is the best album of the last decade!  This is a beautiful, uplifting album!  The instrumentation is amazing and the arrangements are gorgeous!  The songs are great, and the vocals are superb! I will be buying this album in its entirety!

Amazon review: This is a very good album, but it is not the best Prince album of the last decade.  I recommend it for the fans of Prince, but I am not a fan of Prince.  I don't think he deserves this album, but I am glad he did it.  It is his most accessible, commercially viable album to date.  It should have been a big seller.  I don't think Prince is a singer that should be making hit albums.  He should be making a solo album or an album that focuses on a smaller number of songs.  This is not that album.  This album is a great album, but it is not one I will be buying.  I don't think Prince deserves this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is the best Prince album of the last 10 years.  It is a masterpiece, and it is a must-have for Prince collectors.  It is brilliant and has great instrumentation.  It is the most accessible Prince album yet.  The vocals and instrumentation are great!  The songs are brilliant and the arrangements are gorgeous.  This album is one of the best

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I love this album!  I was listening to it with my headphones on and I was literally singing along to the songs. I have heard a lot of O&Hearn albums, but this one is my favorite so far. I could listen to it all day. I love the music. The lyrics are great and the music is beautiful. I have bought several albums by O&Hearn and have been very happy. I have listened to this album more than any other he has recorded. I highly recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A great album. Very inspirational. He is a great musician. I have listened to this album a lot. If you have ever been in a dark place, have lost hope, found forgiveness, or just want to feel better, this album can help you do just that. I like the way he uses words to express the dark times in our lives.  I do not think he is at his best when he is playing his more upbeat songs. He is a great songwriter and has a great ear for melody. I have also heard this album as a cassette tape. I do not think it has even been mastered. The quality is not great. The songs are very short and I don't think anyone would enjoy them as much as I do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of O&Hearn. The fact that he is still playing and playing and playing is a testament to the quality of his art. He also has a unique way of writing songs that I am not used to. This is a very well produced album. You will be amazed at how many different instruments are used. If you have never heard him play you are missing a lot. This album is very inspiring. This album was made in 1993 and it still holds up. I love it. I have listened to it over 500 times and have listened to it over a thousand times. I think it is the best thing he has done.

Amazon review: This is another fine album from O & Hearn.  I didn't know him until I was in college, but I knew his songs.  Like "Playground" and all the other sad songs.  I was going to post this as a positive review and then thought, hey maybe this is a negative review.  I listen to O&Hearn's songs and the ones I like are always the same.  I have heard him play live, but I don't think I've ever seen him in person.  There is a lot of music on this album, but when he is playing his typical style of music he is very good.  One of the best albums I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I just bought this album for my wife and I, and we are both absolutely in love with it.  This is the first album I purchased by O & Hearn, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.  I think the best thing about this album is you can hear the difference between O&Hearn and the other band he has been playing with (he was the drummer in the band that would eventually become Red) this album is very different from the typical O&Hearn music.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of O&Hearn.

Amazon review: This is a CD I would buy again and again.  The whole CD is great.  The playing is great, the lyrics are great, the music is great, and the presentation is great.

I have been listening to O&Hearn since I was a teenager, and this is the first CD I have ever bought by him.  I am really happy with the way this CD turned out, and it was one

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are exemplary, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $34.99 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the s the same for other high priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings, 1953/1967". It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us buy an entire album just to get one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I was looking for the new version of this song, I found it. I was very pleased with the new version. A couple words of warning, though. The new version could use some work. It's not nearly as catchy as the original, but it is a good representation of what this song is all about. I also do not think the new version is as good as the original. The original is more like a dance song than a love song. Anyway, I love this song, and I think it is a great representation of the song.

Amazon review: This album is very well put together. I like all the songs on this album. I like "Heading Out to Lunch" and "The Man Who Sold the World" the best. "Hail to the Thief" is also pretty good. I think this is one of the best albums that I've ever heard.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

You are here: Home / Blogs / Reviews / Reviews: Bonnie - Awol Nation

It's been five months since I've been able to listen to Awol Nation CD.  If you know me, you know that I am currently dealing with a very serious health issue.  I am now in the process of undergoing a 3 month long treatment and while I am hoping to hear news and read updates on my blog, I will not be posting.  The last time I posted I posted a note asking for help from my friends and family.  I would like to thank you all for your help and encouragement.  You are all true friends and I will continue to miss you.

I am now going to listen to the new Bonnie album "Awol Nation" and have just started it.  This will be my first and last review on her blog.  I have listened to "Awol Nation" and it is the best album I have ever heard.  It is better than her last album "The Way We Walk".  I think she is a genius and has a gift that is very rare.  I don't think you'll find another artist in the world who can write and perform songs that can be described as beautiful.

I wanted to share a little bit about where I am at right now with Bonnie and my health issues.  I have been dealing with a serious health problem that requires a complete and total rest and not being able to write or post.  I have been very depressed and have been in and out of a coma for the past seven months.  I have a very rare kidney disease and I have had surgery to remove the stones that were blocking my ureter.  I am on the kidney transplant list and have been given a time frame of about another six months to go.  I am hoping that I can go back and write posts on my blog and hopefully my recovery will be complete.  I will try to update you on my progress and will not be able to write.

The only reason that I have been able to write is that I have a little "gift".  I have a little bit of music and it is a song that Bonnie wrote called "Awol Nation".  I wish I could write all my songs but I can't.  The song was written when Bonnie was in a very bad place.  She was in a coma for several months and she was only able to write songs.  The song was written in her hospital bed and all she had was a pencil and a few sheets of paper.  I like to think that I am her "little gift".  I want to thank all of you who have been with me through this very difficult time and I hope that you all have a very special day today.  I am going to go back to my "coma" and I know that I will not be able to post or write on my blog for a very long time.  I will try to write a little something everyday but I will have to make due.  My blog will be my blog again.  I will try to post something every day and hope that I can get back to writing!

I have been very down and I have not been able to write my songs.  I am not sure that I will ever be able to write again.  I want to thank you all for your encouragement and support!

I have been very fortunate to have very supportive and loving friends and family who have supported me and encouraged me to get back into writing songs again.  They are all a part of me and I will never forget them.  I hope that you all have a very special day today!

I am going to listen to Awol Nation and I will post my review.  I

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I have a list of music that I want to own, but I'm not quite sure what to buy so I can do it.  I don't like the idea of buying a complete collection (except for classics).  I'll probably buy a few albums, but most of the time I'm going to buy a couple of albums or a song on a compilation.  I'm also happy to pay $25-$30 to get a song that I like for $10-$15.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of songs by a number of artists.  Many are obscure, meaning that the artists and compositions are rare.  Very few of the tunes are by the same artist.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Brandy since the age of 10, when I first saw her with the Backstreet Boys. I have listened to all of her music. I have been to her concerts. But this is the first time I have gone to the website and read their reviews. I am not sure if I understand what is happening here. I am very confused. I am not sure how an album is supposed to go viral unless it is on the web. I am not sure how this album went viral when I know that there were no reviews, no social media buzz, no buzz on the radio or music press.

Amazon review: I didn't really like this album. I thought that the vocals were good. I love the back story on this album and the songwriting was good. The beats were all over the place. I thought the song was ok, but the album wasn't too bad. I was hoping for another song after the first five songs and that song wasn't what I thought. I was hoping to hear a song with the same beat I heard on the track to a song on the album. I was hoping for a song to be a little better than what it was. The album was not that bad, but it was not that great either. It was okay.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

I was given a copy of this album by mistake.  It was supposed to be a CD of the "All-Night" album.  But my mistake was I forgot to put the extra jewel case on the CD and they were all "stacked" into one.  So I did the only thing I could think of:  I tried to get this album off of Amazon as a CD.  But I did not notice that it was not an "All-Night" album.  So I did what I thought I might have to do:  I called Amazon.  I explained the situation to whoever I was talking to and they had the album for me.  
So I went ahead and put the CD on Amazon and it came up as an "All-Night" album.  And I still paid for it.  I just thought that Amazon was confused and that they would correct it.  But they never did.  
So here I am, still trying to figure out why this album sucked (besides the fact that I probably should have picked something else) and what I did wrong.  I guess it's a good thing that I still have my copy of it.

I love this album.  It's a good album, in my opinion, and I will continue listening to it.  I don't know if it is worth $5, but I think it is worth it.  It has some great songs
