Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I am just very disappointed with the CD. I am listening to it in surround sound and have noticed that the sound is very weak. This is only the second time that I have listened to this work in surround sound. The previous time I listened to it in surround sound was back in 1995 when I was still in college. I am disappointed that I am unable to listen to this in surround sound.

Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of this piece, but have recently become very disappointed with it. I am a big fan of "Tosca" and have been to see it several times, but have heard this piece and have been unable to listen to it. To me, it is very boring and uninspired. I have heard many things from other people about it being bad, but this is the first time I have heard it be considered bad. I feel that it is being unfairly judged. This is the first time I have ever had an opera that was bad, but I have had some other opera's that were good and bad. I feel that the critics are being unfair to the artist and to opera as a whole. I have had an opportunity to speak with composer Philip Glass and told him that this opera is not his best, but he still feels that he has to put this on a CD. I have a list of some of the many things that I believe should not be sung and how he has gone about making this opera what it is. I have listened to this opera many times and loved it, but I am having trouble understanding what he has done. I cannot understand the depth of emotions he has put into this opera, nor that I am not seeing what is there. The opera is very beautiful and has excellent music, but it is extremely hard for me to understand how it has been done. I am not going to try to explain it, but will leave it at that. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

Amazon review: This is my favorite opera. When I first saw it, I was blown away! I know that it is very well-written and performed, but I just didn't enjoy the piece at all.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is a very simple CD. I was hoping to get some good gospel music for the christmas season. I have a few friends who sing lead and I have been looking for music for them to sing. Well, I have been listening to this cd and I have to say I love it. It is a simple recording of a simple christmas tradition. There is not a lot of background and a lot of emotion to the songs. I am impressed with the recording of them. They sound good and I can sing along with them. Well worth the 20 dollars.

Amazon review: I am very pleased with the CD. The quality of the recording is very good. The lyrics are so easy to sing along with. I love Christmas. I am not a christian. I actually do not celebrate it. But, I like to sing Christmas songs. I like the way the Christian music is sung. I don't know how the CD was made. I tried to download it from other countries. I couldn't though. I was not able to listen to it on my computer because it was compressed. I am glad I bought this CD. I believe it is very good and the artist has talent.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This is the first of three of his solo albums. This is the first of his solo albums. This is his first album to use the new M-50 studio. He also recorded a duet with the French artist Yves Saint Laurent. You will NOT get this CD on Amazon.com.

This is a very good album with a lot of detail and great use of high quality orchestral instruments. The music is superb. The only thing I think that is lacking is a little more feeling in the vocals.

I also have a hard time remembering the song title.  The songs are not varied from one to another.  The songs are mostly country and some western.  I am not a fan of old but this was not up to the standards of the other CD's I have bought.  I would say it was a 7/10 but I am not sure if I would rate it higher or lower.  I would recommend to anyone that enjoys rock n roll and old artists and this is a great album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

###
Amazon review: I had heard that the singing was pretty good. I was wrong. It sounds like they just had a choir of cats.  It is not a "singing" voice.  The vocal quality reminds me of an accordion.  It is not at all enjoyable to hear.  I will not take my eyes off of this CD.  I only buy classical works in CD format. If I am going to listen to a CD, then it should be a good one. The vocal quality and the sound quality are not that good.

Amazon review: I bought this record on a whim. I didn't know what to expect. What I got was the first CD I have bought on Amazon not to find out if I liked it or not. It's a good album...it's just that, it's not at all what I was expecting and hoped it would be.  I bought it to support the artists that I love, but it turns out that I did not like it.  It is not an album that I will listen to again. The music is good, but it is not original or something I will be able to identify with.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this song.  I believe it is one of the few songs in my iTunes library that I will actually buy on CD rather than download (just in case I ever am lost or lost in the web).  This song is not a "hit"...the chorus is the only part that is hit, but that's ok.  This song has a great groove, and a great chorus that is a hit.  I don't think I'll ever forget the chorus.  I have heard this CD on the radio several times, and I have come to like it.

Amazon review: I bought them both.  I am glad I did.  One is a "hit" and the other is not.  I am not saying that you should never buy a hit or one that is not a hit.

Amazon review: This is an excellent classical album.  It has all of the best songs from the best classical artists.  They are all very well recorded.  There is a bit of a difference between this album and other classical albums.  It is just about the best for classical music.  I don't think this is a classical album that you should buy on a CD.  But a best sell album.  I don't think that you should buy this one on CD either.  I love classical music, but I hope you do too!

Amazon review: I have had the opportunity to listen to and review the entire CD collection of this artist.  I am very impressed.  The first CD is very good.  It had some very good songs, that I would have been willing to give to anyone, including my children, to take home and listen to.  But, I was very disappointed.  The second CD is a little better.  However, they are not as good as the first CD.  I am not saying that you should never buy a CD. But don't expect them to be all that good!

I would recommend another album for meditation.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I was excited to get the new Twiztid album and was very surprised at how mediocre it was.  It has good production, but is mediocre lyrically.  The lead singer lacks any charisma, and is too soft and whiny for rap.  The production quality is decent, but the songs are not memorable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As the title says, this is one of the worst rap albums I have ever heard in my life.  I'm not really sure why this is a bad album, but there is something really wrong with it because the songs are boring and there are no good songs.  To put it plainly, the songs are terrible. The only good song is the "Momma" one, but the song is so bad that I couldn't even listen to it for more than a few minutes.  I'm sorry, but I have to call this album a complete waste of time.  If you like rap, you'll like this album, but if you don't, give it to someone with a better taste in music.

Amazon review: This album is a complete waste of time.  The songs are unmemorable and most of them are not even good.  My only positive experience with this album was listening to it while driving to work.  I am a big fan of the band so I was excited to hear it.  But I'm a little disappointed because I feel that the production is lacking quality and the songs are unmemorable.  They could have used more production quality, and better lyrics.  The production quality is just okay.  The songs are just boring and I feel that the lyrics are also lacking.  I feel that this album is a complete waste of time.  If you like rap, you will like this album, but if you don't, give it to someone who likes rap.

Amazon review: Twiztid's fifth album is a total waste of time.  The songs are awful, the production is average, and the lyrics are just plain awful.

If you like rap, you will like this, but if you don't, give it to someone who likes rap

Amazon review: I've been a Twiztid fan for a while now, so when their new album, "Twiztid" dropped I was excited.  I was excited for the new sound, and I was excited to hear the new artist, Madrox.  The songs on this album are all amazing, and this album is perfect.  I was expecting great things from the album, and I was not disappointed.  The songs are all great, the production is strong, and it flows great.  The only bad thing about this album is the fact that it has the same production as "Twiztid", but the songs are all totally different.  All of the songs on this album are great and I really don't think I could have picked a better album to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After listening to this album I can say that the production is a little weak, and the vocals lack any real energy.  The production is great though.  This album reminds me a little of the early days of "Nappy Boy" and I think that it could have been a great album if they had kept the production the same and added more rapping.  The songs are all good and they have a nice flow to the songs.  The best parts of this album are the rapping.  I have to give the album 9.1 out of 10.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

They will hate you when your mom is listening.  It's just not for me.

Amazon review: I was hesitant from the moment I heard the CD.  I was worried that the vocals might be a little harsh and the music would be too electronic for me.  So I listened to the CD on a loop a couple of times and was pretty impressed.  I was nervous about a "hit" when I first heard the CD.  Jewel was in the news and I was afraid I'd be disappointed.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the CD was nothing like I thought it would be. The songs were well composed and well sung.  The vocals were not bad, just ok. She still had that raw, sincere, wonderful voice.  The music was a little too electronic for me.  I was expecting a lot of hits in the first 2 songs.  I found that to be the exception.   It was a very good CD and I would recommend it to people who like Jewel.

Amazon review: Jewel is an amazing singer.  I don't think I would have liked her singing all the songs on this CD. I thought her singing on Bitter Sweet Symphony was ok, but I was expecting a lot more variety.  I just can't stand listening to the same song for 3 hours. I found a few new songs that I liked.  The new songs are not all that different from what I know of Jewel's.  I know that I will listen to this CD on repeat for at least a month and then move on.  I will listen to it again on the holidays.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know about you, but if I were in New York City and had a chance to meet this woman, I would run screaming to the nearest phone booth.  I'm sorry, but this is my least favorite Jewel album.  I know she has a good voice, but this album is just not for me.  This is the 3rd CD she's released in 4 years. It's too bad because I really like the singer.  She has the soul.  I wish she would just sing what she feels.  The only thing that bothers me is the music.  I wish she would just sing what she feels.  I just can't stand it.  I would love to see her perform live.  It would be so beautiful.  I was hoping for something different, but I guess that is just not going to happen.

Amazon review: I have always liked Jewel, and her voice is very good.  Her new album is not that good.  She sounds more like Whitney Houston, but I understand that she is trying to reinvent herself.  I have no problem with that.  I was hoping for something different, but it didn't happen.  She sounds really good but this album is just not worth it to me.  I don't know... her voice just doesn't do it for me. I'm going to let this album sit in my CD player for a while and then listen to it when I can find it on my iPod.

I have heard her on other CDs and this is the worst.  Not only do I not like it, I don't think I will buy a Jewel CD ever again.  I just can't stand it.  I will wait for the next CD to come out.

Amazon review: This song is a great example of Jax's strengths: it is not a heavy song, but it has a deep, soulful tone that is quite different from any other Jax song. His voice is smooth and sultry, and he sings with a sense of drama and power.  The song ends with a strong, triumphant drum part, and a very catchy guitar lick.  Overall, this song is a solid, if not exceptional, example of Jax's voice and range.

Amazon review: This is a great song -- but it could have been better.  Jax sings with such sweetness and emotion that I fell in love with the song.  But the song could have had a bit more of a beat (it's not just a steady beat...it's a strong beat).  Also, the guitar is way too static in the background.  The song is definitely catchy, but the guitar doesn't let it to the same level as the vocal.  All in all, I would give it a 4.5/5.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

About the Author

I started this blog in August 2009 when I was a senior in high school, and I'm still going strong! I'm a senior at the University of Tennessee currently studying Political Science with a minor in International Relations. This blog is an outlet for me to voice my opinions on music, movies, television, music, films, TV, music, movies, TV and anything else that I feel needs a little "spanking". This blog is also a place for me to share my favorite music, movies, TV shows, music, and anything else with my fellow readers. I'm not here to make you stop whatever you are doing to read my random ramblings. Don't be shy! I love to read interesting articles, but I also love to have interesting conversations with my readers.

I am not a professional writer, but I have an excellent memory, and I wrote my first blog post in 2007. I've tried to keep it up to date with the times, but please be patient with me.

I'm an avid Elvis fan. I've been to Graceland multiple times over the years and I hope to go to Nashville and Memphis some day. I have visited Graceland numerous times since I was a child myself!

I am a huge fan of the Nashville Predators and the Tennessee Titans. I love to watch Tennessee football, but I'm glad that I don't have to drive to Knoxville for that. I also love to listen to country music, but I always have my own music playing in the background. I'm a country music fan as well. I love all types of music and I think that's what makes the world go round!

I am a huge fan of the University of Tennessee and Tennessee football. I have no problem with the University of Tennessee basketball team, but I'm sure that they will do just fine without me. I have a very soft spot for the Tennessee Volunteers. I would have said the same thing about the University of Tennessee Football team if they hadn't won a single game. I'm not a huge sports fan myself, but I do like sports. I like to watch sports, but don't watch a lot of the games myself. I have never been to a Tennessee athletic event or a University of Tennessee event. I guess I have never been much for "the university" as they call it. I never attended a game or a basketball game. I don't think I have ever been in a University of Tennessee locker room. I never had the opportunity to attend a

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am not sure what to say.  Maybe just a rating of 5 stars.  I have listened to the whole CD and I am not sure why anyone would give it a rating of only 4 stars.  I am not sure if I would have changed a rating, since I have listened to this album for about 20 minutes.  Every song sounds like a different style of music or has a different feel.  I do not think any two songs could be compared to another.  The instrumentation is very nice, and the harmonies are very well balanced.  I can understand why Libera would want to make a recording for a CD, since he has a nice quality sound.  The vocals are very high in the mix, but not to the point of losing the background noise.  It does sound like a CD, which I guess is nice.    I am hoping someday soon to hear this CD on CD.

Amazon review: I had the chance to see the movie,  "The Good Wife".  I thought the music was great and performed well.  I thought the "good wife" herself was hot.  I will not say too much about the movie, but it was a good movie.    I would like to see a movie that shows a realistic view of the problems we have as a country, as well as how a person can help.  I really enjoyed the music, but it was more of the vocal performances that impressed me.    I found it kind of hard to put myself in the position of either the husband or the wife.  I think it was a good movie, but I don't feel we really have the right to judge.    I have heard the songs before, but I have never heard them performed by a jazz band.  The vocals were very good, but the vocal performance was better.    I am not sure how to rate the CD.  It is a good CD, but I am not sure how to rate it.

I heard the songs before, but I have never heard Libera perform this well.    I think this CD is great.  I think I will buy this CD again.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: This album is not for the faint of heart. It's not a musical based on the life and times of a fictional character, but rather a story that plays out in the lives of real people and the lives of the characters at the core of the story are true - whether or not you believe it. Lin Manuel Miranda (LMM) has had an extraordinary career. He is a Broadway legend. He is a  national icon. But what he  is most known for is his mastery of the music of his native Trinidad and Tobago. On this CD, his most inspired creation is his  
masterpiece of a musical, "Hamilton."
