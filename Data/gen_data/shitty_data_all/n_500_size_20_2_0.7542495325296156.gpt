Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

This is the perfect soundtrack for the lazy rainy days, and the occasional rainy day on a concert tour.

Amazon review: I was excited to see this band live at the Roxy in LA last year.  I have been a fan of the band since their early days in San Diego.  They have been around for about 12 years now, and have released a variety of albums since then.  I had heard their album "The Dreamers", and had to go out and buy it.  I thought this was a great album with great songs.  Unfortunately, I was not a fan of it, or the band.  The band is not known for their great stage performances, but I really enjoyed seeing them at the Roxy.  On the whole, I give this album a 1.5 out of 5.  I think the band's sound is not what the band is known for.  Their songs are not that great.  The songs on this album have a lot of the same qualities that their songs have had for years.  They are catchy, and they have catchy songs.

I have seen them live three times, and I have been to their shows in California (Roxy, The Roxy and The Catalyst).   I think they have a great sound, but I don't think they are perfect.  I don't think they are a perfect band.  I don't think they are a perfect live band.  I don't think they are a perfect group.  I think they are a great band, but they have had their moments.  The songs are fun, but they are not perfect.  They are not the best songwriter, and they are not the best singer.  There is nothing wrong with the band, it is just the songs.  It is just boring and generic.  There is nothing here to recommend it.  I would give it a 1/5.

Amazon review: This is the one I had never heard.  This is what happens when you buy iTunes and buy one song.  The album cover features him.  He is a young man that doesn't look older than 25.  He has this incredible voice that is so deep and beautiful.  I've never heard anyone sing like this.  He's singing about how he's in love with a woman so he's leaving her.  It's so sad.  He is a young man and he is singing about his feelings.  I love this song and I hope he has a great career.

The band has had a few number one hits, but I have not heard them on an album in a few years. Perhaps they should have released this album earlier and been more consistent. I do not know if I will buy a Biffy Clyro album again. I have never liked their music and I cannot understand how someone could like them. I just do not understand it. I think this band needs a break. I love them for their music, but I cannot understand why anyone would like them. They are not a band I would ever listen to.

Great album!

I have been a fan of the band since the early 90s and their music has always been great to me. I have been listening to them since I was a kid and have been impressed with their music ever since. This album was good for a while and I was hoping that it would be the last album I would have to buy. I was very excited to get it and just started listening to it right away and I was so glad that I did. I was amazed at how well the songs were written. I was also happy with the musicians. I like the way they played and the way they sounded, and it just sounded like they were having fun and that was what I look for in a band. I would have liked them to have played more of their hits but I was happy to hear all of their songs. I am still going to buy their albums that I have already purchased because I have been a fan for a long time and I still have the original albums I bought as a kid. I don't know how they do it. I wish them the best of luck, I just hope they can keep doing what they do best and get the recognition they deserve. Thank you for listening!

I'm not sure I have ever heard anything like this before.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

I'm a little late to the party, but here's the album! I didn't really have any expectations - I just wanted to see how it turned out. It's a solid album, but I didn't love it as much as I thought I would.

I'm a little late to the party, but here's our "second season" of the podcast! We're still in the process of writing out the new season, but the rough theme is that it will be more in line with a more "traditional" show than the first season. For example, instead of having a single "star" (i.e. a person who gets the whole season) they will have several (i.e. like a team of people who get the whole season). This means that the theme of the show will be more like a sitcom instead of a traditional drama. It won't be a completely traditional drama either (i.e. a more "western" type of show). This means that it will be more of a traditional drama than the first season was.

My goal in writing this episode was to have a season that's closer to the show that we're working on right now as well as one that's more "traditional" in terms of the show itself. This means that it will try to do a little bit of all of that. It's a little "off" on a few levels, but that doesn't mean it's not going to be fun to listen to.

The premise of this episode is that Kelly's sister (Michele) and her husband (Ryan) have a dream where they're living in a house in the woods and Kelly's dad (Robert) comes over to check up on them. There's a lot of things in the house that make no sense. One of the things being that there's a lot of stuff in the house (like kitchen cabinets, etc.) that don't belong. It's also a kind of a "modern" house. Robert is very excited to see all of this and he even has a few "modern" things in the house like a microwave and a microwave oven (that doesn't work). So why, we'll find out. That's where our story takes off!

The first song of the episode is "I Need You" by the Pussycat Dolls featuring Kelly Price. I actually have a friend (who I've never met, but I get on very well with) who is a huge Pussycat Doll fan and she gave this song to me for my birthday! I was a little skeptical at first because it's a Pussycat Dolls song. I haven't listened to the band in a while, but I still have not been convinced it's a good song that I would want to listen to. But I ended up giving it a listen and I ended up loving it. The song is really pretty and I love the lyrics. I guess I should have listened to it before I bought it. :)

The song that I actually love is "Lullabye" by the Shins. The Shins are a band that I've really grown to love over the years. Their music has really gone way out of the way to be my "go-to" album when I have a hard time finding something to listen to

Amazon review: I was hoping to find a movie which was both funny and entertaining in the same time. I am really disappointed in this movie because it was very over acted and full of bad acting. I feel that it could have been a lot better if the director had just focused on the acting and let the jokes do the heavy lifting. The bad acting made this a very one sided movie. I would rather watch a movie with a lot of funny jokes than watch a movie with bad acting. I hope you read this review and feel the same way I do.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The most beautiful work of art in the world. The music of this album is like a symphony. It sounds like a symphony, it makes you feel like you are in a symphony, listening to it while driving, just chilling in the house, reading a book, or just sitting in the garden. The beauty of this album is amazing. This album is very emotional and I don't want to say sad but at times it is very sad. This album is like a movie on repeat, it is a moving journey through your soul. I am so in love with Demby. He is the most beautiful man I have ever met.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: I've had a lot of problems with my CD players over the years. I've tried several different brands and none of them are good enough. I finally gave up and bought this one! It sounds great and plays all CDs I put on it. The sound quality is great, and the price to me makes it a no brainer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: CD players have become a staple in my collection. I've been using the same one for years. I've had a lot of problems with the other ones. It seems that they are less reliable now. But, when I plug in this one, I get the exact same sound quality as before. Very happy with it.

Amazon review: I have owned an iPod for several years, but I always felt the need to have a CD player as well. Since I have a pretty large collection of CDs, I decided that I needed a new player. I thought about taking it apart, but I finally decided not to do that. I got the CD player because I knew I couldn't go wrong with what I have now. I just wish I had gotten the one with the built in DVD player.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I loved the sound of the previous CD player. I like the look of this one, too. It is nice. I don't have to worry about damaging a CD, as the CD-ROM is built into the plastic.

Amazon review: My first CD player was a broken-up, damaged unit that I purchased with my own money. I spent an entire weekend putting it back together. I love the sound quality, it plays all the CDs I own, and the built-in CD-ROM makes it very easy to keep track of all the music.

Amazon review: I have three different models. The first one I bought from a second hand store. I paid as little as £17 for it. The second one I bought when I bought a house. It is a used CD player that was given to me as a gift. It is still in the car, and I still have no plans to sell it. The third one I bought when I got a new house. It is a refurbished CD player that was given to me when I bought a house. It is still in the car, and I don't plan to sell it.
