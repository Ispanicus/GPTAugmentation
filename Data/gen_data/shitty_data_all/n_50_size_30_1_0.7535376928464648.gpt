Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

The song selection is good, the production is good, the artwork is nice, the CD is nicely protected, and the packaging is very nice and well done.  The only thing I don't like is that it is the CD version.  I would have loved to have seen a DVD version.  The audio quality is pretty good.  There are a lot of great songs in this album.

I have a large collection of music that I have downloaded to my computer. I enjoy listening to music, and I enjoy saving the music I like to play on the Internet. I also enjoy listening to songs on the radio, as well as listening to the radio (and listening to music on the radio) I had a CD of this album. I listened to it for about a week. I was very disappointed.

The songs are not the best, there are some really bad ones. I do like some of the songs though. I would have liked a DVD version, but I don't think I would have liked it much.

The CD is in good shape. I am going to give this CD a 5. I don't know if I would recommend the download.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The first time I cried and the second time I laughed even harder. The characters are so real and so believable.

Amazon review: There is a reason that "The Good Wife" has a cast of over a hundred and why the word scream is in the title. The music is phenomenal. The acting is amazing.

The story is a tragedy and you really feel the pain and anguish of everyone involved.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I bought this as a gift for my sister. I was not disappointed.  It was a great gift for her.  The songs are beautiful and well sung.  The CD is perfect for family & friends to listen to together.  The only thing I would change would be in the lyrics.  The lyrics of the songs in the CD were mostly the same, and I think that is what I liked, as I know that this is Christmas music, and it would be great to have it different from the other Christmas music I have in my CD collection.

Amazon review: I purchased this product through amazon.com. The song I got is called 'The Road'. I did not get the album, but I did get all the songs on it! It is actually a full length cd (like a cd-r or cassette tape, but with a better quality sound.) I've owned most of the songs on it and have listened to it many times. I purchased the album, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. I guess I didn't have the right address. Anyway, I wanted to share my experience with you all. I am not sure what all I wrote on the page that was posted. I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I purchased it the same day I bought the cd. Also, I have had no problems with any of my other cd's. I have purchased many, many music cd's through amazon.com.

I love the part in the song when the guitar solo starts. It is a very nice guitar solo. I have a great appreciation for artists like Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and the like. I enjoy listening to their music. I love to put the music to sleep, but I also like to listen to it when I am out and about. I am an avid listener and I have been listening to music since I was a child. I have to say that I am very satisfied.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I played this CD at a party, and everyone loved it.  Really great music, and the sax player is phenomenal.  If you like classical, or jazz, you will love this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am in love with her new cd.  There is a real raw emotion in her songs.  She sings like she is at the top of her lungs.  I'm not in love with the music but I really love the emotion in the songs.  I am so happy for her that she made the new cd and it is so awesome.  I hope she can do more music like this.  I really think she has an amazing future.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid's 3rd studio album is a bit of a departure from the other two.  This album is much more of a straight up rocker with the occasional rap interludes.  I think the song "The World Is Mine" is where they are trying to make a name for themselves but they are no where near as good as the other two albums of theirs.  The production is very slick and the guitar work is on point.  At times you will get the feeling that the band members are trying to copy their own style.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album to get if you are into the new hard rock sound, but unfortunately the album is very forgettable.  The song "The World Is Mine" is a highlight but the rest of the album just isn't that good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to agree with the negative comment.  This is one of those albums that is supposed to be a big deal, but it's too bad.  I was hoping for a "big deal" album like "The Last of the Mohicans" or "The Great Gatsby" but I guess I'll have to settle for this.  The song "The World Is Mine" is a great song but every other song on the album just doesn't have enough good songs to make the album worth buying.  The songs are not awful, just not that good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the albums that I got a few months ago and I am still on the fence about it.  I am not a "hard rock" guy.  I like R. Kelly, but I don't like his music.  Even though the lyrics to the songs are supposed to be about sex, they are all about love and relationships.  I like songs like "I Believe in You", "Ain't No Sunshine", "The World Is Mine", "Can't Be Tamed" and "Don't Worry" but the album is just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album, but not as much as the first two albums by R. Kelly.  The songs are definitely better than the first two and most of them are pretty good and have some great lyrics.  The songs are a little repetitive, but this is a typical R. Kelly album and just a little more polished.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is another R. Kelly album that I have not heard.  I think that the songs are not good enough to make it stand out from the other R. Kelly albums.  The songs are good and well written but the production and lyrics are not the best on the album.

Amazon review: This is his thirteenth studio album.  This album was released in 2000.  I thought that this album would be better than the first two albums.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is R. Kelly's second album.  I picked this one up because I hear there are a lot of really good songs on it.  The songs are great and all of them are well written.  The songs are a little repetitive but that is to be expected from an R. Kelly album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is Kelly's second album and I am enjoying it.  It is not an easy listen, but I like it and I am still enjoying it after all these years.  I have to admit that I can't think of any bad songs from this album.  There are only a couple songs that I can really compare it to, but the album is still enjoyable.

Amazon review: I have to admit that when I first heard this album I thought that it was about sex, but I am a little disappointed in the way that the lyrics were written.

There are a couple songs that are really good and a couple that I didn't like.  I can see why people buy the album and like it.  The songs are a little repetitive, but that is to be expect from an R. Kelly album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.
