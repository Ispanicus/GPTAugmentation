NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I have purchased this twice and have no idea why the record company wanted to do this with the other one, and I'm only one person.

Amazon review: I enjoyed this album, especially the songs on it. However, I found the songs to be a little repetitive, and the lyrics to be very "wordy". The songs were also sometimes very boring because there was nothing much happening in the music. The music was good, but the lyrics were not. Overall, I enjoyed the songs. However, I can't say the album did that much for me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this twice, and I have to say, this is a must have. The only downside is that they didn't make it to a CD, and only had a vinyl version. It's a very powerful album at times, especially "It's Alright (for Lazarus)". I would recommend this album to anyone who has a life-changing need to hear such a message.

Amazon review: First time I have heard this album was back in the 90s at a party and then on the radio. I have been wanting to get it for a long time and now that it is finally available to me, I am overjoyed at the opportunity to own it. This album speaks for itself.

Amazon review: I found "Lazarus" quite interesting due to its message, which I thought was very interesting. I thought the lyrics were very powerful and very relevant.

For this reason, I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in hearing more about Lazarus.

I wish there were more songs like this out there for all of us to hear.

Amazon review: What is it with Amazon.com and these things.  I ordered an MP3 player off of Amazon.  They returned everything and said I'd have to send it back.  I asked them for an explanation.  I was told, "Oh, sorry, we can't help you."  I was in my car at the time.  The next day I called the store and asked why they couldn't help me.  After I left a message on the machine they called me back and told me they couldn't do anything about it.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I called them again and asked them, "Did you say anything else about me losing my order?"  They said, "Oh, yeah, we made a mistake and you'll get your order tomorrow.  By the way, we have a very good track record with these things.  We rarely get things wrong."  What the hell???  So I called them back and asked, "What if I had two MP3 players?  Would you have sent two?  What if I had two CD players?  Would you have sent two?"  They said, "Well, that's a lot of things to ask.  We'd have to look into it."  That's it??  I've got an order that says they will send me something tomorrow.  I'm not happy about it.  So I called again and asked, "So why did you send me all that?"  That's when they said, "Well, I'm sorry, but we can't help you."

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

The worst part is that the songs are not good.  That being said, I found it interesting but not worth the money.

Amazon review: I had to laugh when I heard that.  This is the most pretentious CD I've ever heard.  It's like a collection of songs that would be perfect on an album by a band who used to be on the radio and would be on the cover of Rolling Stone.  You can tell the bands are a few decades old because it's not like they recorded their best stuff during this session.  It's like they had an album cut up and put on the CD.  And then they changed the arrangement a little.  Even if they didn't, it's obvious that they put it on there because it's the same song but with a different arrangement and different lyrics.  It's like listening to a song that was cut and put together from different songs, only to find out later that the arrangements and lyrics have been changed.

Amazon review: This is the best of the collection.  As I always say, the CD is a collection of songs from different albums but arranged the same.  No matter which album it is on, it sounds like the same song but played in a different way, but still sounding like the original.  The worst thing about this is that there are some good songs on it, but it has the same songs on it for the most part.  It was not worth the money spent on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'll have to agree with the previous reviewer, this album is very disappointing.  The songs sound the same, but they could have been cut from different albums.  As far as the arrangements go, the tracks sounded like they were cut in a similar way, but it is not the same arrangement.  It seems like the cuts are from different albums with the same songs but different arrangements.  That being said, there are some good songs on the album.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: This band is bad. I've been listening to them for a few months and I can hear the same song over and over again. I guess they have some really bad singers because there's probably not much that can get over the sound of that awful voice. I don't know why they even bother trying to be popular. It's too bad because I like the songs on this cd. They sound like the old rockabilly songs that I grew up loving.

Amazon review: A few years back I purchased a record from a music shop in a mall. I was looking for a record that I could put in my car to play while I worked.

I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't like this cd. I don't like the songs, the last song I don't like and the lyrics are just so stupid. This is an average cd I guess. I hope it lasts longer.

I'm not sure why I don't like this cd. I like the songs. They all sound really good. But I just don't like the songs on this cd. I have listened to it about an hour and I can't stop listening to it. It's good for some songs, it's bad for some songs. It's a cd that I like. I would recommend this cd, but I don't really like the songs.

I'm not sure why I don't like this cd at all. I don't like the songs, the last song I don't really like, and the lyrics are just so dumb, I guess. I guess I should've listened to the first four songs before I listened to this

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: The song was recorded in December 2006 in Detroit.  The guitar riffs and playing style on the song are very similar to the music of King Crimson.  This song has an old school vibe that is very cool.  It does sound like it is from the 70's.  It was recorded at the end of 2006, but the sound quality doesn't reflect that.  The song is very well put together with the instruments backing each other up.  The band sounds very tight and professional.  The drums sound like they were recorded live and not mastered to sound better.  The bass is also very good.  The vocals are very clear and very clear.  I highly recommend this album.  If you can find it, get it.  If you can't find it, make sure you get it or you will have to do without it.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

This album is mediocre and I can't help thinking Timberlake is in the bottom tier of songwriters.  He can be hot, I must admit.  But when he writes bad music and tries to do "pop" like he did with his last album, he just doesn't get it.  I am glad I bought his last album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

If you're buying for the songs on the disc, get it. If you're buying this for the songs on the disc, get the DA disc instead.

Amazon review: I bought it because I wanted to find out what he was singing about.  I bought it for the song "The Beginning" (and the album is better than the first one).  I bought it for the songs "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out" and "Anchor".  I bought it for the narration.  I am not a huge fan of the narration.  I have no respect for him (though I can understand why he does it).  I don't like the songs and I don't like the way he sings them.  He is a good musician, but he doesn't have any soul.  I am not sure what he is singing about, he could be singing about his relationship with the Lord, but I don't think he is.  There are other songs that I could have gotten, I just didn't get them.  I guess I could have gotten "When I Fall" and "In The Air" and the other songs from the disc for that matter.  What I like about this album is that the songs are good, the music is good, and the songs are all good.

They sound like it's been done through a megaphone, and I don't know if that was done on purpose to sound like that.

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!

Cleaning of a hard drive

I am having a problem with a hard drive that had been used for a couple of years. When I turned it on this morning it was not showing up on any of my programs. I tried to run a virus check but the computer wouldn't let me open any programs or scan files. I finally shut it down and turned it back on and now it is not showing up on any of my programs. It is plugged into the back of my monitor. I have tried to open the drive with a new computer and nothing shows up. I tried to run a virus check but it wouldn't let me open any programs or scan files. I finally shut down and turned it back on and now it is not showing up on my programs. It is plugged into the back of my monitor.

What I have done to solve this problem:

1. I have tried to make sure that the drive is plugged into the back of the monitor but it still doesn't show up.

2. I have tried to make sure that the drive is plugged into the USB ports that I have on my computers but it still says it is not plugged in.
