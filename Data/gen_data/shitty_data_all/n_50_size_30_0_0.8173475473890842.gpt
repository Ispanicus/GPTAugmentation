Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This is pretty good.  I don't like the singing, but it is still good.  The lyrics are ok, but don't get me wrong, I like some of the original stuff.  I just wish the vocals would have been edited out.  Not too hard, just a minor thing.  The voice is just fine and the production looks good.  The piano is pretty good.  I would just like to make a suggestion.  I know that if you use the "play all" feature, and you don't have a CD of your own music, then you can add the CD to your library.  If you have a CD of your own music, you'd think that you could just add the CD to your library instead of buying a new CD.  Maybe if you would put the CD in your library, you would have the option to listen to it, and then you could add it to your library.  This would make it very easy to transfer your music to the computer.  I know that if you are going to buy a CD, you are going to buy the CD.  You are going to buy the CD so you can listen to it.  Then, when you finish the CD, you will add it to your library.  I don't know of anyone that does this.  I think that if you buy a CD, you buy it to listen to it.  That is what you are paying for.  If you can buy the CD, and then later on, you can add it to your library, you are going to buy the CD to listen to it.  That is what I am saying.  I just think that if you have the CD in your library, then you could add it to your library.  That is one way you could do this.  I just think this could be an easy way for people to get their music in their library.  I think one of the things that has been lost in the world of electronic music production is the idea of the music library.  I think that if we would have had this idea from the beginning, we would have gotten rid of everything that was on the computer, and we would have had the music library to go along with our music.  If we had this idea, then we wouldn't have had the music on the computer, and we wouldn't have lost our music in the computer.  I think that if we would have the music library, the computer would be a big waste of space.  I think that the music would be a big waste of space if we didn't have the music library, because then we would be using the computer like a big record player.  I think that this would really help everyone.  I think that if the library is in computers, then we would see a big difference in the world.  I think that if we would have had the music library from the beginning, we would have lost everything.  We would have lost the music, we would have lost the records, we would have lost the CD's, we would have lost the albums.  We would have lost everything.  I think if we would have had this idea from the beginning, we would have had the music on the computer.  The world would have been a much better place if we had this idea from the beginning.  I think that if we would have had this idea from the start of the computer, we would have had the music library.  It would have been a much better world.  I think that if we would have had this idea from the first day of the computer, we would have started off by having the music library, and then we would have lost everything.  We would have lost the music, music would have been on the computer, our records would have been in the computer.  We would have lost all of that, and we would have had a great world.  If we would have had this idea, I think that we would have lost the world.  We would have lost the world.  I don't think that this would have been very good for our world.  I think that this would have been very bad for our world.  I think that this would have been the end of the world.  I think that if we would have had this idea from day one, we would have lost the music.  We would have lost the records, we would have lost the CD's, and we would have lost everything.  I think it would have destroyed our world.  If we would have had this idea from the beginning, the world would have been a very, very different world.  I think that the world would have been ruined if we would have had this idea from the beginning.  I think it would have been an end to our world.  I think that is something that we would have had to change if we would have

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: After listening to "I'm Not" for the umpteenth time, I just decided to give this a listen. I was pleasantly surprised! The production is really slick and there's just enough instrumentation to make it sound like a live performance. I like that I can hear the difference between the two versions of the song. And the vocals are just fine. It's a really nice ballad. I'm not surprised that they played it in the movie either.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like this song and I like the song on the album, but I don't think this is a good song. When he sings "I'll be here, I'll be here, I'll be here in the morning" - is he singing to a woman or to himself? Most of the time if you know the lyrics, it's about a man and he tells a woman he loves her and then he runs away. I don't know why he would do that. He doesn't have any reason to stay and his relationship with the woman is over.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I really like this CD, and I thought it was a good price. However, I was disappointed in the quality of the CD. It was a bit scratchy during the first 5 minutes.

I did have to turn the feature on to show all of the songs. I would recommend this to others.

Amazon review: I have just recently (3 months ago) started listening to your CD's. My first CD was the "Love Notes". I was initially put off by the fact that you were singing a woman's song (as well as a man's song) but it grew on me. I have been listening to your CD's ever since. I think I am beginning to get "toothache" from hearing your songs over and over again. This is the first time I have been put off by a song. I know that I should just get started with the CD's when I get home but I am trying to see how I can get to the point where I am finally liking your songs. I think I am on the right track. I want to know what I am missing.

Amazon review: I have been listening to "Love Notes" for some time now. I really really like the songs and the stories.

Amazon review: This song is one of the better songs on this CD. The lyrics are simple and beautiful. The story of the song is about a man who was separated from his wife. He went on a journey to find her. He had no idea that there was evil in the world and he had to go through a dark and scary place in order to find his wife. The song is beautifully sung with great dynamic and passion.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of you and your music. I was extremely excited to see your CD's on the store shelves. I have listened to them many many times and I really like them. I am not sure what I was thinking when I bought them. I guess I was just happy to have the opportunity to check out your work. I am not sure about the quality of the music on these CD's. It is definately not what I would call high quality. However, the music is really good and I have been enjoying it. The story I have heard of your work is that you have a very personal relationship with God. I really like the fact that you have such an open heart to the world and that you are a Christian. I also feel that you are an awesome artist and that you have made many great songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am so glad I stumbled across your music. I love everything you do. The song, "You're Not Just My Mama" is one of my favorite songs on the whole CD. I love the lyrics. I love the piano part and the harmonies. It is the song that I love about the most. I love it because it is about a man who has been wronged by his wife. I love the way it starts off. When he is about to leave her she is telling him how much she loves him. I love the way it ends. He is trying to make amends and he is asking her what the problem is. She says she will explain it to him and goes to her bedroom and waits. He walks past her room and goes to get a drink of water. The next morning he goes to his wife and she is still sitting in her chair. He goes to her and she is just sitting there. He walks past her and says, "What the hell kind of song is that about?" She says, "It's a song about how much I love you." He says, "I know what kind of song that is because I love you."

Amazon review: I actually bought this album because of the story on the back of the album cover. I saw a video on YouTube (it could have been a TV show or a radio show) and the singer described the story. I had to buy the CD because I just could not pass up the opportunity to listen to the song. The lyrics of the song are wonderful. I like the way it starts off. As it goes along you get more and more emotional. I like the way it ends. The song is really good. I think it is a good song to listen to when you are in a bad mood.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is the best Meghan Trainor album to date, it has so much going for it, catchy songs with great melodies, a great sound production, and a great singer.  I'm not really a fan of r&b pop music, but if i'm going to buy an album, I'm going to buy this one.  I'm not a fan of any of the other Meghan Trainor albums (The 20/20 Experience, Let's Stay Together, or the new one I just listened to), but this is a masterpiece that I don't think the rest of the world will find until it's come out.  I like the fact that it's different from the other records, but I don't think it's a great album.  I wish this album was on the radio, but I don't think it would work, because it's not that catchy, and it's not that good of an album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing I will say about this album is that it is very well produced.  The song "You & I" is very catchy, but the other songs like "Just Like That" and "The Only Time" are average.  The other songs are good, but I feel like I have nothing to say about them.  The album is over long, and I feel like it's too short.  I feel like this album could have been better, but I didn't read the full review.  I guess I will listen to it again in the future.

Amazon review: I love this album.  The only complaint I have with this album is that the CD is only 3.5 stars with 5 stars for the album. The album was really good, but the CD is too short.  The songs are great, and the songs were really good, but the CD is too short.  The CD would have been good up to 14 tracks, because I would have liked to have heard more songs.  The CD is really good, but the CD is too short.  I think you should make a CD with a lot more songs on it.

A:

The only negative thing about this is that it's only at three and half stars rather than the five stars it should have.

A:

I'm not sure how you feel about this album. I listened to it once about a year ago and I like it. It has a lot of good songs in it. I think it's one of the best albums of the year. It has a lot of positive songs in it. It's not a bad album in every way.

               

A:

I have a lot of criticisms for this album. 
I've loved the past few Trainor releases and the album "Let's Stay Together" is my favorite so far. But this album is not as good. 
The songs are quite good, but I don't think they work well together.
The album starts with "I'm Yours" and it's a song about a relationship and doesn't really build that deep, I feel.
The album also starts with "I'm Yours" and it's a song about being in a relationship and doesn't really build that deep, I feel. 
The other songs don't really build that deep, I feel.
The album doesn't have a strong lead single and I don't think it was necessary to have 5 strong singles to build the album. I think that's why the album starts with a song about a relationship. 
The music video for "I'm Yours" is boring and doesn't have any personality.
The music video for "You & I" is boring and doesn't have any personality. 
I feel like the songs on "I'm Yours" don't fit together very well.
The song "The Only Time" starts with "The Only Time" and it's a song about the feeling of being in a relationship and doesn't really build that deep, I feel
There are only 4 songs on the album and they are "One Love" and "I'm Yours" and "You & I" and "The Only Time" and "The Only Time".
I feel like the album could have been more than 4 songs. I think that's why the album starts with a song about a love relationship, because it doesn't build that deep, I feel.
I feel like the album was too short. I think it would have been better to have had more songs on the album. 
I feel like this album could have been better, but I didn't read all the reviews. I guess I will listen to it again in the future.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is my first cd and I would like to say that I had a great time. The cd is good. The songs are all good. The production is just awful. It is like they had a few songs they were going to put on the cd and the producers thought it was a good idea to mix in 2 songs they had written a few years ago and played on some old rock and roll radio stations. It is a little embarrassing to read the reviews that say "This isn't a musical"  but then I read the reviews that say "This is a musical"  and then I read the reviews that say "The music is great" and then I read the reviews that say "The actors are talented"  and then I read the reviews that say "The actors are not talented"  and then I read the reviews that say "the production is terrible"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a great show" and then I read the reviews that say "This is a terrible show"  and then I read the reviews that say "You should have seen this show when it was first presented"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a terrible show and I had to get out of the theater"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is an excellent show and the actors are good"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a bad show and the actors are terrible"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is an outstanding show and the actors are good"  and then I read the reviews  that say "This is a great show and the actors are bad"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a really bad show"  and then I read the reviews. "This is a really good show"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a good show"  and then I read the reviews that say "This has a lot of potential"  and then I read the reviews that say "This has no potential"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is average" and then I read the reviews that say "This is amazing"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a masterpiece"  and then I read the reviews that say "This has a great message"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is the best show I have ever seen"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is the worst show I have ever seen"  and then I read the reviews that says "This is a very good show"  and then I read the reviews that say "This show is a waste of time"  and then I read the reviews that say "This show is awful"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is one of the best shows I have ever seen"  and then I read the reviews that say  "This has some redeeming qualities"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a waste of my time"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a horrible show"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is the greatest show I have ever seen"  and then I read the reviews that are just a bunch of reviews that say "This is not the greatest show I have ever seen" and then I read the reviews that say "This is the awsomeest show I have ever seen"  and then I read the reviews that have only one review and that review is written by a person that is so old that I have never even heard of him or her and then I read the reviews that say "This sucks"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a piece of crap"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is a musical masterpiece"  and then I read the reviews that say "This is the second greatest show I have ever seen"  and then I read the reviews  that say "This is the greatest show I have ever seen"  but I read the reviews  that say "This is a great musical"  and then I read the reviews  that say "This is really the greatest show I have ever seen"  and then I read the review that says "There is nothing that can compare to the original Broadway production"  and then I read the reviews  that say "This is one of the greatest shows

I only gave it 3 stars because I don't really like the lyrics of most of the songs.  The songs that I do like is the "I Can't Help Myself" song.  I believe this is one of the best songs ever written.  It made me feel like I was in a room with my best friends.  It made me smile, and I hope many others will feel the same.  The lyrics are nice.  I thought this cd would have a lot of singing, but I didn't hear any singing at all.  But, I did hear the drums and sax.  They are nice, but not really "high energy."  I would like to hear more singing, but I am not sure if I feel that way about the lyrics.

Amazon review: This song is so cheesy.  I would like to have just a few more songs from this cd.  Some of the songs that are on this cd just don't seem to have any redeeming qualities about them.

I bought this cd over a month ago, and I still haven't got around to listening to it.  I don't know what to think of it.  I have downloaded a few songs from it, but I still don't like any of them.  I am thinking of returning it, but I don't feel like it's worth the return charge.  I mean, it's a cd and it doesn't have any redeeming value to me.  I would rather listen to a cd that has some redeeming value, than a cheesy cd that I don't even like.

Amazon review: I recently purchased the "Tales from the Bottom of the Lake" cd.  I am a sucker for cheesy music, and this cd is definitely cheesy.  However, I will admit that I like the songs that the composer wrote.  His name is John Travolta.  John Travolta is not a well-known actor or singer.  He is famous for being a singer and a movie star.  It's been said that he won a Grammy in 2004.  He was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Original Song.  This makes me think that he should have won a Grammy for "Tales from the Bottom of the Lake."  At this point though, I don't know if I would even give it a rating.  I would give it a 4 or 5, but I can't give it more than a 4.  The songs that I liked were "Don't Be Afraid" and "I'm Sorry."  There were a few others that I liked but they didn't really go anywhere.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

However, I just read that she has been diagnosed with cancer. I can't imagine the stress she is going through just to have this album that she has worked so hard on.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

There's a new song from R. Kelly, and it's called "My Heart Will Go On". It's from the new album, entitled "Till the World Comes Together", and is the first single from the album.

This is the single which is released on iTunes, and also on other online retailers such as Amazon.

It has been released in the UK on Tuesday 19th October 2008.

This is a great song with a great beat. You can easily download this song on your iPod, if you don't have it already.

This song is not the entire album, but it's a great song on the album.

If you like R. Kelly, or any other R. Kelly songs, then you'll love this.

I give this song a 5/5.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
