Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I'm not even gonna try to describe this album.  After you listen to it, I'm not even sure you'll be able to find an album with a more original sound.  But what I will say is this:  1) This is the kind of music that is hard to find on the internet.  2) This is the kind of music that will make you want to go out and buy every song on this album.  3) It will take you a long time to listen to this album.

Amazon review: I don't know if anyone else is listening to this, but the music here is amazing.  It is the sound of a band from the 70's which is a big plus.  The vocals are just as good, if not better, as their contemporaries.  I would really recommend this album to anyone.  I also recommend you to the first song.  I think I will not let this album go in without giving it a positive review.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful album.  I have listened to it twice.  The first time was just a few months after I first heard it, and I was already in love with the music.  The second time I listened to it was a few days ago and I had not even heard it before.  Both times I was blown away by the music.  This album is a must have for any fan of the 80's.

Amazon review: This is the greatest rock & roll album ever.  The lyrics are the best ever.  This is a definite must buy for any fan of rock & roll.  I am a true Rock & Roll fan and this album is a true Rock & Roll classic.  I would like to say however that I don't think it is a must have.  I think the album should be sold on its own.  But for $25 I think it is a must have for any fan of rock & roll.

Amazon review: This is an amazing album.  It's really hard to find an album that is this diverse.  Some of the songs are just as good as other songs on the album, and others are just as bad.  Some of the music has a heavy metal feel to it, and some of the music has a more bluesy sound to it.  It has a lot of different sounds which I find enjoyable.  The only problem I have with the album is that it is only on one side of a two disc CD.  It would be better to have the album on one side, and have the songs on the other side.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This an amazing album.  This album is a must have for any rock fan.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest rock n roll albums ever!!!  The music is fantastic, the lyrics are great, and the sound quality is great.  This is one of the best rock albums ever!  This album deserves to be played and listened to over and over again.  I would like to add that this album is also extremely long.  There are some songs that are really short, like the last song, 'I Will Follow.'  I really can't understand why some people don't like this album.  I love this album.  I would recommend everyone to listen to it at least once.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: So, after listening to this album for the first time I think it's great, but I haven't had the chance to listen to all of them, so I am just going to give it a rating of 1 star, and I will go back to my normal level of reviews. I will say that I was really surprised by the music, but I am a big fan of R&B, I love the voice that R.Kelly has, so I guess I must be a big fan of his music. Also the songs are all great, you can tell that he has the right amount of feeling in his music, I mean, he can make the music sound like he is singing about something that he is truly feeling inside, so that is really nice, but they are all just generic songs, and I don't know... they don't sound like R&B at all, some songs are just okay, but I just like the R&B better. I don't care whether R&B is a genre, I just like the music, but I think they should have tried to do something that isn't totally generic. The only thing I can say is that I think the R&B genre is very overrated, and I just don't find it all that interesting, I mean, I know it has it's good and bad points, but I just don't find it all that interesting, I guess I am in the minority, but that's the way I feel about it. I just can't see how people can be so damn critical of it, because if you listen to it, you will know that it really is all about the music. It is such a shame that people are so down on it, it just doesn't matter to me, and I think it is really sad because I really like R&B.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am happy that I found this album and I have been listening to it since I bought it! Very nice but you need to be at least a little bit of a music fan to notice any differences between this album and other R&B albums. I am not a big R&B fan, I like some of the other R&B artists but I think this is a very average song and I don't think I will get any enjoyment out of listening to it.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I was wondering why I didn't see any negative comments on this album. I have listened to it about 20 times and it has become addictive to me. Jewel's singing is very powerful and very good. The songs are all great but Jewel's voice is so beautiful that I can't stop listening so I will continue to listen. I am glad that I saw comments on this album. I would hate to have to hear Jewel sing something like the first song. I'm sure her voice is fine, but she doesn't have to sound perfect. The CD is worth the money.

                This song is not a pleasant listen
               In my opinion, I have to agree with the comments.

              It's not a pleasant listen

             *I've heard that there was a different version
              (more than one). I don't like the new version.

             It's just my opinion. But this is my favorite
              song of all time.

              I only wish I could connect better with
              Meghan Trainor. She's an amazing
              singer/songwriter. I hope I can connect
              better with her next album.

             But this is a song that I just can't get
              into. I don't like the new version.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

For anyone who is curious on what the title of this album means.  The song "Satisfied" (from the album of the same name) is actually a song about a man who is satisfied with nothing in life.  He says that he wants to be happy and he has no other desire.  He gets it.  If you don't have it you don't really want it.  The song "I'm Satisfied" is about someone who is satisfied with his life and has no desire for anything else.  He doesn't care about someone else.  I don't know how you can have it all, I guess you do.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the better albums for 2010. The only thing I really don't like about this album is the lack of variety in the songs.  I would have liked something from G.O.O.D. and some other more original artists other than Twiztid.  Some good songs and some not, but overall a pretty good album.

Amazon review: I just started listening to the album, so I have not had time to listen to it in depth, but I am left with a bad taste in my mouth, that's for sure.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It's just different and different is good for the listener.  So I would recommend this to anyone.  What I didn't like was that it was full of filler songs.

Amazon review: Eminem is one of my favorite singers.  I really like him and think he has a great voice.  I love his music.  I don't know why he hasn't been able to get people to listen to his music.  It could be because they just don't like his music.  I have tried to listen to his music a few times, but I just can't seem to get into it.  I think I'll just wait for him to get a little older.  I think it will just be more difficult for him to get people to listen to his music when he is a little older.

I have been singing for more than 12 years now, and I sing to be happy or to express my feelings. In my opinion, the best music on CD Baby is the CD's that have the best songs. These songs are all great. I have bought several CDs by the same artists, and my favorite CD of all time is by the same artist, but I never knew that it had the same name as the CD I loved most.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I love Meghan Trainor.  There are a lot of songs on this CD that I like, but the lyrics are not very good.  I don't really like the song "I Need to Be by Your Side".

Amazon review: Wow so worth it! Did not mind spending 20 bucks when I can listen to this on repeat all day.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing that really stood out to me is the song "Gone" by the Fugees. That aside, there is a lot of songs that i didn't really like. I found the rap to be a little off...too much of a "gangsta" rap. I really hoped that there would be a lot of good songs, but alas this album was not it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album, but it just didn't do it for me. I just didn't see how anyone could "live" in a world where the whole world is in a constant state of war. The music felt very much like a "summer" release to me, and I really hoped that there would be a lot of good songs on this album.  And not only did there not seem to be many good songs, but there were just too many tracks that had no variety to them. Some songs were just repetitive, with the same words and structure coming out over and over.  I ended up deleting this album and not picking it up again until I saw that Twiztid had a new album coming out.  Now I am listening to it.  I just don't get it. I just don't get why anyone would want to live in a world where the whole world is in a constant state of war, which is the case when you consider that we are a very small world as far as population. As for the music, I am not really a fan of Twiztid's music at all. I like the Fugees, but I don't find anything about their music or lyrics special. Especially the lyrics and songs about "gangsta rap."  And I think when you talk about war, when referring to the war in Iraq and/or Afghanistan, it doesn't need to be a gangsta rap style of war. I find it to be a very violent war, and very unappealing. I just hope that the new album by Twiztid is as good as their last 2 albums.  I can't wait to listen to that album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The new Twiztid album is very much a different animal from their previous albums.  The Fugees feel like they have been trying to make an album for a while, but all they were able to come up with was an album that was generic and boring.  The album has a lot of good songs, but the only songs that stand out for me were "Wake Up" and "Gone."  The vocals by Madrox on the album are very much a "gangsta" rap voice, and I can't stand it.  The album has a very unappealing feel to it.  There are a few songs on the album that I can get into, and they are the ones where the singers have a strong voice that is very unique.  The production is also very good, I really don't have any complaints about the production on this album.  I just wish they could have done a little more with the songs.  I really liked "Gone" by the Fugees, and I just really hope that they can record more songs like this when they make their next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is pretty good, the first two are better than the last ones.  The songs are good and the chorus is good.  There are a few songs that I had a problem with before and now I'm getting used to them.  I do like "Gone," it is a good song.  I don't like the song "Back to the World" and it sounds like a song by a bunch of street gang members.  I don't like the song "Wake Up" and I think, when they record it they will probably change the chorus.  I didn't like the song "Gotta Get Out" and I think the lyrics are wrong.  I like the song "Too Much" and I find the lyrics to be good.  I like all the songs on this album.  The first two albums are better than the past ones.  The music is good and it seems like they are trying to make a good album.  I like the song "Gotta Get Out" and the song "Back to the World."  The song "Wake Up" and "Too Much" are pretty good.  I don't think the song "Gone" by the Fugees is good at all.  I don't like the song "Back to the World."  The song "Gotta Get Out" is good, but I think the lyrics need to be a little different.  I don't like the song "Wake Up."  I don't think the song "Too Much

Amazon review: I don't feel like there was a lot of new ground covered on this album.  I think Twiztid's album is pretty much a straight up rehash of their first album with the exception of the two bonus tracks. This album is a fun listen, but not a must own.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought Twiztid had found their niche, but it's kind of obvious that they're not.  I don't know, I just found this album to be repetitive and not really all that good.  Its a decent album to listen to, but I don't think it's anything to get excited about.

Amazon review: I thought they were good until I realized they were just a lot of the same songs.  I don't know, but I felt like they were trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.  I do like the album, but its not something I'll listen to again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album is a little better than the first. It has all the songs from the first Twiztid album.  It is also the only one that has a song on it called "Slim Thug".  It's not a bad song, it just isn't as good as the first one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good album, but I wish the songs would have fit better.  On this album, there were two songs that I really liked, and one song that I liked quite a bit.  The songs were good, but they just didn't have a ring to them.

###
Amazon review: Twiztid has released two great albums in the past.  This is the second one and I think it holds up about as well as the first.  It has a few good songs on it, and a few songs that seem to be the same from the first album.  I think they all do the same thing.  I don't think this album is better than the first, but it is probably the same.

Amazon review: This CD is a great album. I am not a choir or a musician, but I know my Bible, so I enjoy listening to music in that genre. The one thing I am not a fan of is the CD being advertised as being "The best CD I have heard for sale on Amazon." This may be true, but how can you expect me to buy a CD that I do not know whether I want, that I do not know why I have, that I do not know whether I will like, that I do not know whether I am capable of enjoying, that I do not know whether I am even capable of listening to, and that I do not know whether I like? And for this reason, I cannot and will not purchase this CD. I am going to return the first CD, and continue to purchase the other CD's.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought her music as a gift for my wife and we have listened to it many times.  The first time we heard it we said, "Oh,  it has a good sound," but when i took it to the car for a drive to my neighborhood, it sounded very distorted and distorted from the front and back.  I have been trying to figure out what the problem is.  It's been very frustrating.

I also like the lyrics and I think the person who wrote the song did a great job.  You will not be disappointed.

Amazon review: This CD is an excellent music CD and I definitely recommend it.  I purchased this CD as a gift for a friend of mine who is a hard-driving  business professional.  This CD is a good fit for his work because it's quite mellow and he doesn't have to worry about distracting his clients from the important issues that they are trying to achieve.  The lyrics are very good and the music is very smooth and very pleasant to listen to.  He will listen to it several times and he will enjoy it.  It is a very good gift for a friend.  I look forward to hearing what is in store for his next CD.
