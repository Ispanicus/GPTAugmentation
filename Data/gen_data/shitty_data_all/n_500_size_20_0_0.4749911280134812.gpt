<p>The Music That Moves Us</p>
<P>We are looking for the next great music star. We are not looking for a pop star, rock star, or pop punk star. We just want someone who can sing and entertain us. We want to hear the best and the brightest, and that has to be the music that moves us. We want it to be music that has been on the radio, but we want to hear it live. </p>
<P>It doesn't have to be a huge stadium, it can be a local, a small concert, even a backyard concert. We want the music to be in your home, and we want it to be live. We want the music to be live Internet radio. </p>
<P>We are looking for the best song to get the word out to our audience. Our target audience is the young adult. We want to reach out to them and let them know that they are not alone. We want them to know they are not alone. We want them to know that they are not alone in their quest to find an artist that they can connect with and that has something to offer them. </p>
<P>It is not about how many people are listening. It is about connecting with our audience and letting them know that we are there

Amazon review: There's been tons of stuff released in my genre in 2013, so I'm always looking for something new. This album has a very unique sound. I don't know if it's a mix of many different genres, or if they take a very different approach to their genre. So far, I'm really liking this album.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since their days on the label, so I was really excited to see that they were releasing this collection.  I will admit that it did surprise me that it was a two disc set, as there was only one song on the second disc.  I expected it to be a little more diverse, but it's still a nice collection.  The acoustic album is a huge departure from their usual sound, and I will admit it's a little strange to see a band that sounds like a band but isn't one doing this acoustic album.  I have found the acoustic album to have a lot of strong moments, while the band's normal, full band sound is much more subdued than I was expecting.  But I am glad to see Josh and the band continue with their acoustic projects, and I really hope they can find their groove again soon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought it was a great album.  Their sound is very different from the rest of the band, but I really like it, and it's hard to think of another band who makes me feel like I've seen them live, but I think I've heard them on their albums.  It's a real shame, because while I like the music, I just can't get into it.  I think it's because I have such a limited way of enjoying music.  I like listening to music all day long, not just when I am in the car, or on the way to a place that I'm going to.  I don't just like the songs, and I don't just like the albums, and I don't just like the sound.  There are a lot of other things that I like about music.  It doesn't need to be like this.  It's like people say, "I only like what I like, so I like what I like."  I like what I like.  So I don't get into bands that sound like bands, I don't get into things that are different than the things that I like.  I'm like, "I don't really care, I don't like that." It's nice to have someone say, "Yeah, I like this, but I don't like that," but that's not what makes music interesting.  I really like music that has a message, and I really like music that I can get behind.  I like music that I feel good about, and I get very upset when I get songs that sound like things that I don't like.  I would rather listen to something that I like than something that I don't like.  That's why I like so many different kinds of music.  I don't have to have all the things that you have to have to listen to music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always preferred the more traditional sound of the band, but I was really happy to see this collection.  I enjoy the band's music, and I can't imagine listening to anything else.  I was disappointed to see that they had changed their approach, but I guess that's a part of the evolution that they have been going through as a band.  I have been a huge fan of Josh and the band, and I have been disappointed when they veered away from their original sound.  I have loved their music for a long time, and I wish them all the best in finding their sound again.  But it'd be good to hear them return to their roots.  They have a very fresh sound, and that makes it very interesting.  I definitely want to hear them more.

Amazon review: I love this music and can't think of anyone I like a little better than Josh.  He is a great singer and a great person.

I have been a fan of the band since their first album, but I really hope that this album is a sign of a better future for the band because I think it would be great if they could find their sound again.

He is truly a talented musician, and I hope that he can find his way back to his original sound and be able to continue to make great music.  I'm really enjoying this album.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.

Amazon review: The Newsboys have been covered by everyone from The Beatles to The Dixie Chicks.  When you have a band that can be covered by everyone from Britney Spears to Justin Bieber, you can't go wrong.  This is a great compilation of songs by a band that has been around since the '70s.  What stands out for me is the songs that remind me of my favorite bands of all time: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan.  The song titles speak for themselves, but I can't help but think of my favorite lyrics and melodies.  You have to admit, it's pretty catchy.  All in all, I would say this is a great compilation.  My only complaint is that the songs get old after a while and I'm looking forward to hearing the next one.

Amazon review: This band is for real.  They are not one of those bands that is great for a first album, and then they kind of go downhill, but as their catalog grows, they become a great band.

Not to mention, they are a good band.  I just wish they would keep going.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I was introduced to the band by a friend and got the album from iTunes. I had never heard of them before and was a bit skeptical. But the songs flowed so easily and at times I almost didn't notice them. This song in particular was pretty great. But then the music started getting repetitive. I was starting to get a bit tired of the repetitive beats and the vocals felt a bit forced. I am a bit of a music fan so I really wanted more. Some of the songs were a bit short but others were the perfect length. The band is talented and I really enjoyed listening to their music. I am going to buy their next cd when it comes out.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I always enjoy the music that I download from Amazon. I like the fact that they don't put the song on their website and just put it in a.zip file. This way their customers will be able to listen without having to download a song that they already have.

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: If it where possible, I would leave zero stars! One of the worst albums I have ever purchased.

Amazon review: The version of the song is not my favorite. Unfortunately, I think this is the only version released. I even tried to find the song on the soundtracks of the National Lampoon Vacation movies but wasn't able.

Amazon review: This album contains some amazing songs. Some of the music is very, very sad. I have always enjoyed the music of Stephen Sondheim, but I have never quite felt the way I do with this album. The songs are amazing and very beautiful.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album a lot over the past couple weeks. The music is so beautiful, and the songs are so moving. The album is truly an amazing accomplishment.

Amazon review: This is an album about peace and forgiveness. I have always loved and enjoyed songs by Stephen Sondheim. I have even listened to his music over the years, and have been completely taken in by his songs. However, this album was a whole other story. The songs of this album are sad and moving. I didn't expect it, but this album truly touches me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album all that often, so I have no idea how good it is. To be honest, I have not had the chance to listen to an entire album yet. I am not a Sondheim fan (I'm not a fan of most singers), but I am a fan of his music. This album is a mixture of some of the themes that Sondheim has written about. I guess it's not the best album he has written.

Amazon review: I am not an expert on the history of the Holy Bible, and I don't understand the theory behind various translations. That being said, I can assure you that this is an excellent version of the Bible. I can say, for sure, that this is the finest English translation of the Bible that I have ever heard, which makes it quite the accomplishment. This is one of the best translations that I have ever heard, and I am an avid listener of the radio. I have to say, and I'm quite sure that this is very well known, but I can say it to you that this is the best English translation that I have ever heard. I am not a Christian, but I like to think that I am a very good Christian, so I have to believe that this is the best English translation that I have ever heard. It is an incredible accomplishment. This is an excellent translation, and it is well worth the money that you spend on it. If you are on the fence, take the time to look it over and decide if you want it.

Amazon review: I am a big, big fan of Sondheim, and I have been listening to this album very frequently. The songs are very touching. I have listened to the lyrics, and they are very good. There are a number of songs that are quite moving, and I have found myself crying at different points during the songs. This album is one of the most beautiful albums of all time.
