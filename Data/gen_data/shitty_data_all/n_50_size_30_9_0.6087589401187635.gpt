Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Great album!
I love this album

Eminem's album 'The Marshall Mathers LP 2' is a very solid album. I love the fact that there's such diversity of musical styles, and I love the fact that Eminem is able to incorporate so many pop elements into his sound. The lyrics are great, and the vocals have a great range. I love the fact that he uses a lot of the most popular pop songs, and I love the fact that he doesn't feel he has to stay in any one genre. I love the fact that he uses pop songs to express his more extreme feelings. 'Can't say I agree with everything Em has to say, but I'm not an Eminem fanboy. I love his voice and his creativity, and I enjoy listening to all of his albums.

I really enjoy listening to Eminem. I have a hard time listening to any other singer, but Eminem is the first singer I have ever really liked. I like his voice, his lyrics, and he is very creative. I also like the fact that he doesn't need to be over the top with his lyrics and I like the fact that he has made a style of music that is very diverse. I like the fact that he is able to make a style of music that is very pop.

I will be listening to this album for a long time. I'm not sure how many more albums I will be listening to, but I love what he has done. I love his voice, his lyrics, and his creativity. Eminem is truly a great singer.

This album is a complete gem. It combines so many different styles of music that it's nearly impossible to put any one in to a specific category. The only thing that I would say is that I've heard a lot of comparisons to the Beatles and this album tries to follow that, but it's just not the same. This is a great album.

I can listen to Eminem's voice for hours. In fact, I enjoy listening to it so much, that I have it on constant repeat. He has always been one of my favorites and this is no exception. I like the feel of his voice and that he has a powerful singing voice, but I prefer his other work such as 'The Slim Shady LP'

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.

Amazon review: There has to be an Accapella in the book.  The only Accapella, by far, in my opinion, is on the CD of a Lifetime, the Temptation of Elvis.  He is a good singer of the classic rock era.  His singing just gets better with age.  I love his version of "I'll Be Around" and "Crying".  I actually love the whole CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good CD for the price.  I am a little nervous going through this CD.  All of these songs are very good.  I do find myself listening to it quite a bit, and wish I could sing along.  I was a little nervous when I was singing "All I Wanna Do" last night.  It sounded kind of harsh to me.  I would guess it is a really good CD for beginners.  I would listen to this CD again after I learned the song.  I think I would only buy it again if I could buy a CD on the internet.  For the price it is a good buy.  The CD is well produced, and the audio is clear.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I think this album is a good one, a lot of good songs on the album, especially the songs on "We the People". The songs on "We the People" are very catchy and entertaining. I like the fact that the album is made of different genres. The only thing I don't like about the album is that I think some of the lyrics on the songs are very offensive to the people that they describe. I do not think that they should be sung, but I also don't think that they shouldn't. I think that when people are trying to sing the lyrics out on the streets, they should be singing about how they need to kill someone, or what they need to do to make it better. Instead they are just singing how they are tired of life. This album is good for rap songs because a lot of the songs will get over. It's almost like listening to a rap album for people that don't know what rap music is. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes rap or rap music, this is a good album to listen to.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the music on this CD.  There is a fine line between a masterpiece and great, but I think this CD is very good.  It's not perfect, but it could be labeled as a masterpiece.

Amazon review:  This CD contains mostly choral works, but there are a few instrumental pieces and a jazz piece, too.  The choruses are very nice, and the instrumental pieces are very good, and the jazz piece is really quite good, too.   The only thing I don't like about this CD is that the album is too repetitive and boring.  I love the CD, and would recommend it for a wide audience.

Amazon review:  I was very excited to listen to this CD.  I just wish it had some really good music on it.  The arrangements are very nice and the voices are good.

Amazon review: This CD is a collection of choral works by some very talented vocalists.  I was really impressed with the choral arrangements and the voices were very good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Bob Johnson and family were great!  Bob Johnson was a legend! He can play anything, I mean anything.  I really loved this album.  I bought it on the recommendation of my mother-in-law.  She is a fan of this musician and I bought her a CD as a gift.  She has been listening to the music with me on her new MP3 player.  Also, my kids love to listen to music.  I guess that is why I buy these things.  I have to admit that I sometimes buy CDs for my sons, but these are not the sort of things I buy for them.  I have to admit I did buy a few CD's for my daughter, but they were for their own pleasure.  They were not bought for her.  We all love to listen to music.  My husband and I even listen to the same music.  I love his music and he loves my music.  We all love music.

Amazon review: This is a very fine version of Bob Johnson's "I Wonder If I Care" which is one of his better songs.  I like the way this version does it.  I liked the way the instrumentation was done.  I like the way the vocals were done.  I like the way the whole song was done.  I especially liked the way the song was sung.  This is a very fine version of the song.  I listened to this while I waited for my daughter to come home.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Bob Johnson is one of my favorite bluesmen.  This is a good recording of a classic blues song.  The instrumentation is good, the vocals are good and the recording is good.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I have the CD and I will buy it again.  I don't know why I haven't bought this CD before.  He never made a CD for me.  I know he has a CD of his songs that he does in this style, but I have never seen it.  I think that is why the CD never came into my hands.  I really enjoyed this CD and I would recommend it to any blues fan.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have a problem.  This is the first CD I've bought in a long time that I've actually liked. I've seen so many mediocre CDs that I've been very hesitant to spend money on a CD.  This is the first CD I've bought in a long time, and I've loved it. I want to do more singing with my wife.  We are getting married in a couple of weeks, and I want to do a lot of singing for her. I'm not good, but I really like this CD, and I think the songs would be better on a CD by another artist. The songs are not "out there" and are really very special and meaningful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a professional singer for a long time.  I have been trained by the world's very best.  This CD is no different.  It takes a long time to learn how to sing a song correctly.  I hope this CD will help me with my learning.  I've used several CD's to help with my singing, and I have not learned anything from any of them.  This was the first CD I've bought in a long time that I've actually enjoyed.  It is great that there are so many good CDs out there to choose from for learning.  This is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time.  I think I can learn a lot from this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the perfect CD for new singers trying to learn.  I found it extremely helpful in my quest to learn how to perform in front of an audience.  It is very easy to listen to and learn the songs.  I was able to learn the songs on the first day that I listened to it, but after a few days, I was able to learn them with ease.  I love the CD, and it is the first CD I bought in a long time that I've actually enjoyed.  I think it was worth the money.  I'll probably buy a couple more songs on the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this CD because I've been a professional singer for a long time.  There are a lot of songs on this CD that I don't sing myself, and I'm in the middle of a huge project that I'm not able to sing in public, so I really appreciated the songs on this CD.  This CD is not my favorite, but I think it's one of the best CDs I've ever purchased.  I really liked that it was easy to listen to, and that I could listen to it at my own pace.  I think this is one of the best CDs I've actually purchased in a long time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I would give this a six out of ten.  I don't know anything about classical music.  This CD just sounded like a "play" in my head and I didn't understand any of the lyrics.  I would have given it a seven or a ten if it were a 10 out of 10.  The singing was not good but really not any higher than a three.  I didn't understand what the lyrics were trying to say.  I still really enjoyed this CD.  I wish they would have put more in the CD and not just an instruction on how to sing it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just purchased this CD.  The only thing that I don't quite get is the name of the songs.  I only have a problem with the "The Song of a Dream" because I'm not familiar with the title.  I just thought it sounded like a "play" in my head and didn't want to listen to it more than once.  I only found out what it was about because the song was at the end of the CD.  I guess I would give this a seven out of ten.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The lyrics are sickening.  I don't know what to say.  Danzig has never expressed his views on homosexuality in any way.  It seems he's just stating his ideas and using the media to tell his views on homosexuality without any real concern for the person involved.

It's like if I was to tell you what I thought of a film you made that you liked but the movie was so bad and filled with bad acting and bad dialogue and bad action scenes, and horrible dialogue that had no point to it all and made no sense and was pointless, and the ending was a complete mess.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of the rock music genre.  I'm not an avid listener.  I just get bored.  I'm a fan of some of the music I hear from time to time.  This is the first time that I've listened to an album that I was interested in, but I didn't really know what to make of it.  I'd like to hear some of these other songs and compare them to this one, though, so I wouldn't compare it to a bad album I don't like.  I'd like to hear the other albums by them too, and decide what I like best.  I don't want to listen to this album just because it's a good album by Danzig.  I don't think it's a good album.  The music isn't very good.  I don't like it.  I can't explain it.  I don't think it will be to my liking.  It's just not to my taste.  I don't know if I'll like it or not.  I really don't know.

It is not Christian music to me.  I will not listen to it.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums.  I remember it being on the list of best albums of all time. It's rare that the artists in an album are as good as the albums and it's the reason that this album is so special.  It's a timeless album, but most of all, it's a great album.  It's my favorite album of all time.  I love it and I listen to many other artists on it frequently.  I've got songs on it that I'm embarrassed to admit I've never played on here.  I love it.

This is a video of me singing "My Way" from the soundtrack of "Jaws" at the 2017 Jaws Film Festival.

This is a song that I wrote and recorded in my high school years.  There is a lot of emotion to this song, and I'm glad that my high school classmates have loved this song.  It's about my high school experience, and how I overcame a lot of obstacles (music, drama, and sports) to reach my dream.

This is a song that I wrote and recorded in my teenage years.  This song is about being 19, and finding out that I am in love.  I have been in love this entire time I've been 19, and now I finally found a boy I really wish I could spend the rest of my life with.  This song is full of hope, and joy, and sadness, and all the things that go along with being in love.  It is also my favorite song of all time.

This is a song that I wrote and recorded while in the middle of my college years.  This is a song about my college experience.  It is about learning to be a better person than I was when I was younger.  I am very happy to be making the transition to a new college campus, and I am very glad that my best friends are my college classmates.  I am very happy to be making the transition from being a freshman to being a senior, and I enjoy the new experiences that come with being a senior.  This song is about being a student, and being able to make choices that are right for me.  I wish I could have more time to spend with all of my new friends, and I hope that I will be able to make lifelong friends through the years ahead.

This is a song that I wrote and recorded in high school while I was in the middle of a breakup.  This was a very dark time in my life.  I was in the middle of a very bad breakup, and this song was about the pain I was going through.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first set of the CD doesn't quite capture the attention of those who are more familiar with the band. There is a bit of a slow pace. The second set seems to build to the climax.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It makes sense in the context of the song, but it may well be an entirely different song.  As the song goes, the vocals are the only instrument in the song.

A:

You have the following

 "I got a feeling she don't like me" from The Best of Hall and Oats.

I think it's

 "I got a feeling she doesn't like me" from The Best of Hall and Oats.
(Note: I've never heard that song, so I don't know how the lyrics are supposed to go. But I think the sentiment is that "I got a feeling she doesn't like me.")

 And it's a variation of "I got a feeling I'm gonna die" from The Best of Hall and Oats.

 Note: I just realized that "I got a feeling she doesn't like me" is not the same as "I got a feeling she doesn't like me" from The Best Of Hall and Oats.

A:

I think it's

 "I got a feeling she doesn’t like me" from The Best of Hall and Oats.

Because:

 A song with the same title was released in 2006 by The Best of Hall and Oats, but its lyrics are different.

 I got a feeling she doesn't like me.

 I got a feeling she doesn't like me.

In the best of Hall and Oats, the song is

 I got a feeling she doesn't like me.

 I got the feeling she doesn't like me.

But I believe that the song in the movie The Best of Hall and Oats is

 I got a feeling she doesn't like me.

 I don't like her.

 I don't like her.

 I don't like her, I don't like her, I don't like her, I don’t like her, I don’t like her, I don't like her, I don't like her.

 I don't like her, I like her.

 I don't like her, I don't like.

 I don't like her, I like her, I don't like her.

 I don't like.

 I don't like, I don't like.

 I don't like, I don't care.

I believe that song is

 "I got a feeling she doesn’t like. I don’t like. I don’t care."

 I got a feeling she doesn’t like. I don’'t like. I don’t care. She says I don’t care. 

 I got a feeling she doesn’t like. I don't like. I don

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The piano is the highlight of this album and the performance is very good. the song is too short on the lyrics and the instrumentation is too simple and un-interesting to be truly great.  I found the music to be too much like it sounds, not like the lyrics. the lyrics are about people and relationships, which is the theme of the song, so I found that the instrumentation, the piano, made the lyrics sound less emotional.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the music and the lyrics to this song is just so amazing.  I have to give it a 4 star rating because I didn't feel that the song was bad or boring, but the instrumentation just doesn't sound good.  The vocals are great, but I thought it was odd that they didn't have a strong, solid bass line.  This is a very good song and I look forward to seeing them live.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I was not expecting great things from this album, but they came through.  If you are one of the few who love Schubert, this is the one to get.

I could not put this album down and I am looking forward to seeing them again.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
