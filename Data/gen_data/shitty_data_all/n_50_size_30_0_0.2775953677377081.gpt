Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is my 5th time listening to this album, and by now I feel like I am really getting into it.  I love the diversity of different styles and the different instrumentation.  This album is definitely worth the hype.  I absolutely love the different styles of Ray Benson.  This is a must have.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of new Ray Benson lately and I can tell you, once you get into his music, you'll be hooked.  This album will take you to a different journey, and you'll want to listen to it again.  It's got a lot of energy and he is very well known for his powerful voice.  Ray Benson is a great musician who knows how to get the most out of his voice.  This album is worth the money, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

Amazon review: Ray Benson - The Best of Ray Benson This is the best compilation of Ray Benson I have ever heard.  It was written by a lot of people who have been fans of Ray Benson for years.  Ray is one of the most prolific musicians in the world, and all of his music is amazing.  This collection of songs brings together some of his most popular songs and also includes a few gems that I hadn't heard before.  I have listened to this album at least 7 times, and I still have a few songs that I haven't heard before.  This album is definitely a must have!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a compilation of Ray Benson's best songs, and it's very well worth the price.  If you like Ray Benson and you are not a fan of his new stuff, then this is probably your best option.  This album will make you want to listen to Ray more and more.  There are some songs that are a little repetitive, but overall it's a great compilation of songs.

Amazon review: What the hell is this?  I have to say I really don't like this album.  I find the vocals to be very distracting and the lyrics to be very generic.  Not only is this a great album, but it's one of the best albums of all time.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but not for me.  I like more upbeat jazz, so I would like to see a couple of more songs on this album.  I'm not a fan of the vocalist.  I'm not a fan of the music, the whole production is bland and I'm not a fan of the lyrics.  I'm not a fan of this album for me.  I don't like the music.  I don't like the lyrics.  This has nothing to do with my opinion of the album.

Amazon review: This is one of the most boring albums of the year.  The vocals are too low and the lyrics are generic.  It's not your typical Ray Benson album.  I'm not a fan of his new stuff, so I was surprised to find this album on Amazon.  For some reason, I thought I would like this album, but I did not.  I would avoid this album.  I have listened to this album at least 10 times and I still find nothing that I was not expecting.  I have no problem with the vocals, I have no problem with the production, but that's about it.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album hundreds of times and I still don't know what to make of it.  It's a great album, but I just don't get it.  The music is good, but there is nothing about it musically that I would like.  The lyrics are really hard to understand, and the vocals are really low level.  This album is just a big let down from a great album.  I don't like the music, I don't like the lyrics, and I really don't like the vocals.  This album is a let down, I thought it was going to be great.  I have listened to this album at least 10 times and I have just given up.  I just don't get it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Thalia is the only woman on this album that is not married to her husband at the time of recording.  And she is a great performer.  I wouldn't mind seeing her on the stage with a few of the other performers.  Her voice is the best thing on this album, even in the background.  The album is not as bad as you think, I think the problem is with the sound quality, which is okay, but not the best.  The orchestra does not sound very good, and the music is not very well recorded, and the production is not very good.  The only good thing about this album is the cover.  The photo on the cover is really nice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like Thalia and this is a great record.  I love the way she sings, the way she looks and the whole album.  I would like to hear a CD with her singing a cover song of a female artist.  I would like to see that done.  I wouldn't mind seeing her sing a song by George Michael.  I would like to hear her sing a song by Barbra Streisand.  She would have to do the whole album.  She would have to do "If I Did It All Again".  She would have to do "I'll Be Back".  She would have to do "The Boy Is Mine".  She would have to do "I'm Still Standing".  She would have to do "Ain't No Way", "Foolish", "Someday", "I'm the One (Who Loves You)", "You Don't Know Me at All" (which is a cover of a song by Elvis Presley).  She would have to do "What Do We Do Now".  She would have to do "In the End".  She would have to do "My Heart" and "I'm Still Standing".  She would have to do "Heaven Can Wait" and "The Boy Is Mine".

Amazon review: I don't really have much to say about this album, except for the fact that I don't really like it.  This album is boring and has some really bad songs, including "I'll Be Back", "Heaven Can Wait", "The Boy Is Mine", "The Girl You Don't Know", and "Ain't No Way".  I don't understand why this album is so bad.  I had it for only a couple of days, and I didn't really like it.  The only good thing about this album is that the songs are all good.  At least, that's what I thought.

Amazon review: This album is great.  The worst thing is that the worst song is "I'll Be Back" by The Eagles.  That is the worst song that the world has ever heard.  I'm not even kidding!  "I'll Be Back", a song by The Eagles, is the worst song ever heard on any record.  This is the worst song ever heard.  It's not even in the top ten.  It's not even in the top 50.  It's not even in the top 100.  It's not even in the top 500.  It's not even in the top 10,000.  It's not even in the top 1,000,000.  It's not even in the top 10,000,000,000.  It's not even in the top 1,000 million,000,000,000.  It's not even in the upper limit for even the number of stars in the universe.  It's the worst song in the whole universe.  And by the way, it's a cover song of a song by The Eagles, the same Eagles that won the Grammys for "Best Rock Song" in 1971.  What's the matter with you people?  You can't make a decent rock album these days unless it's a cover song by The Eagles.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to these songs several times and thought they were good, but I didn't think they were great. However, I was surprised by them, so I just had to buy the album. The CD is a little pricey, but the album is worth it. But it is much more generic than most of his other CD's. I would recommend this CD to all folks, but it's not the first or the best. It would be a good CD to listen to if you want to hear some new, original songs.

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to be able to meet Michael Franks in person. He is a wonderful man! I was extremely lucky to meet him. We had a fascinating discussion about his music and it was a great opportunity to learn about his career. I found him to be very knowledgeable and an incredibly nice person. As a lifelong fan of folk music, I could not think of a better man to talk to about this music that I love so much! I have known Michael Franks since I was a child and have been a huge fan of his ever since. I could not believe how much this album means to me and my life. I have never had any one tell me that the album meant as much to them as I do. That is what I love about music and Michael Franks has done that with this album. It means so much to me. If you want to really see what music can do for you, and bring you happiness, listen to this album. It will change the way you look at life. It will make you happy in a real, meaningful way.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is a very talented female singer but this CD is not as good as the first CD because it has no voice to sing.  This CD is very inspirational.  Someone should put a plug in Thalia's mouth.  Thalia is the most disgusting woman I've ever seen on television and radio latino.  Thalia sings like a little kid.  If you want a little girl singing like a little boy, just listen to this CD.  If you just want to hear a nice female voice, then listen to the first CD.  I really like this CD.  I hope that someone will get Thalia a little plug in her mouth.  Thalia is the most disgusting woman I've ever seen and I've seen her on televison and radio.  This CD is very inspirational and I love Thalia very much.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I heard these boys for my first time in 1996 in Richmond, VA.  I felt that I had heard 'em all before.  They are so-so but I was so impressed with their vocal harmonies that I decided I would give them another try. The sax player is with Agents of Good  Roots now and the vocal harmonies are by the same people.  So good.  He is so mellow and mellow enough to use in most of the songs.  I have heard other sax players from the same group and they are not as nice as this guy.  I have given up on the cd and have not bought another.  I really have to give up on this cd.  I have had the cd for over two years and have given up on it.  This is the third time I have heard them and have given up.  Not that I want to hear them anymore but I need to know why I am giving up.  I think I will buy some other stuff.  I think it is the sax player.  He is nice and mellow and great to listen to.  I think he should be in the 'New' version of the jazz fusion group.  I think he should be in the 'New' version of 'the' jazz fusion group.  I think he should be in the 'New', Jazz Fusion group.  I think he should be in the 'New' group, Jazz Fusion.  I think he should be in the 'New' group, jazz fusion.  I think he should be in the 'New' group, fusion.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time on a Christian music album.  I loved the album,  but could never find the CD.  Some time later I found it on Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I just wish it were possible to give the CD a rating.  It is so-so.  I did not buy it because I was not impressed with the songs.  They were not good.  I was impressed with the vocals,  but the songs were not good.  I did not give a rating.  This was for the first CD.

Amazon review: So I was listening to "Thalia" for the first time.  I was amazed at how good it was.  I could not believe how good it was.  I kept listening to it.  I had to have the CD.  I was not impressed with the way it was performed.  It was all good but the vocals were not good.  I did not buy it.  I have heard it a few more times and have not bought it.  I have bought other Christian cd's and they are all good or better than the ones I buy.  I don't know what to think about the cd.  I am not going to pay for it.  I don't know what to think.  I think it is a great cd.  I think it is a good cd.  I think it is a great disc.  I think it is a good disc.  I think it is a good disc.  I think they are all good.

Amazon review: I have listened to this disc several times to the point where I have lost count.  I will never listen to it again.  I am going to get rid of it.  I have been in a funk for quite a while.  I have heard it a bunch of times.  I was not impressed with the way it was performed and the vocals were not good.  The sax player is fine.  He is mellow and great to listen to.  I don't know why I have waited so long to get rid of it.  I have a couple of other cd's that I will buy.  I don't want to talk about this one.  I am going to get rid of it.  I have already given up on it.  I have given up on it.  I don't want to listen to this one again.  I don't know why I bought it.  I will buy other cd's.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this set for months now and I just found out I bought it in the first place.  I bought this set as a gift for a friend and I can't wait until I get the second one.  The last CD was not that good so I am giving this set 5 stars instead.  I haven't heard these guys before so I am having a hard time getting into it.  I think it's because of the poor quality of the vocals or maybe it's because of the lack of a bass player.  I'm not a huge fan of jazz but this group sounds like they deserve some respect.

Amazon review: I bought this album because it was on sale.  I'm a member of the jazz club and I thought this would be the right album for me.

It's not a very deep album but it's a good jazz album.

Amazon review: I just got a CD from Jazzmatters.com that had a CD by this group called "The Best of the Blues".  I listened to the CD and  it's ok but not great.  I wish I had gone with something by this group called "Blues-Roots".  This CD has a big production and a lot of people playing the same stuff.  They can play music but they can't write it.  So I gave this CD a 5 star rating.  I think this CD is worth buying because it's a decent CD that's worth the price of the CD.
