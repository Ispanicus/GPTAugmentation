Amazon review: 10 Years is one of my favorite bands. You can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work. While I still prefer Autumn Effect, this album is solid, but that's not surprising at all. I really don't think 10 Years is capable of producing crap. Their music and the vocals are just too good. :)

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band, and I find that the music is as good as any other band out there. My favorite part is the lyrics. But I have to admit, the guitar sounds like a guitar, and the drums sound like drums. I'm sorry to say, I was really disappointed in this album.

Amazon review: Very nice album. It's a bit of a trip to hear a band so different from bands in the genre, but I'm glad I did.

Amazon review: nice song - I'm not a big fan of old school country but this one's not bad.  A couple times in the song the lead vocal is a bit wobbly but she recovers well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: Not even going to bother with this unless they are 320kb quality. Why even bother with something low quality? seriously.

Amazon review: A great album.  Good album, although it's hard to find that quality in most contemporary releases.  I am very disappointed in Chris Isaak's decision to release this album on CD.  This album's sound quality is not so important to me.  However, I do recommend this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm really sorry to see that this is not a best of, but I can't find any good reasons to believe that it is a best of.  I just cannot find any songs that are truly exceptional.  All of the songs are pretty good, but they are all songs that I'm not sure why he would bring them together on one album.  My only real complaint is that the album is so short.  I'd give it a 5 star rating if it was longer.  I like the music and it's a shame that there is just no sense of cohesion to it.  I would give this album a 3 star rating if it were longer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe that this is the last of his "best of" albums.  I have listened to all of his albums since "In Concert" and I have always enjoyed them.  This is not one of his best, but I just don't know why he's not still releasing albums like this.  I love the old country sounds that he was playing on this album, but the songs are just not that memorable.  I like a lot of the songs, but I just can't really remember them.  I did find the album to be very short.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album contains a few songs that I really like, but I can't remember them.  If you like Chris Isaak, you should definitely buy this album.  I am also not a big fan of his music, but I would still recommend this CD to those who like his music.

Amazon review: I have a limited amount of time to listen to this album, and I am not interested in listening to a lot of CD's.  I am sure I will enjoy this album, but I will not listen to too many of the songs.  Good album, but not worth the extra expense.

Amazon review of: I bought this album because it was on my bucket list and I had heard her music since she was 16. I was a die hard Rihanna fan since I was 8-10 years old. She was my favorite artist. I loved all her albums and I even bought the one before this one. I was not disappointed, just not thrilled. I was expecting this album to be special. I guess I was expecting too much. She sounds good, but she is not special. The album sounds like it was recorded by a lot of people. I love the song "Stay", but the rest are just average. I think she is just going to keep on doing the same thing and just keep on selling copies. She is not that talented. I will not buy any of her other albums because I hate when someone keeps on doing the same thing as they were doing before. I don't think she will ever be a great artist. I hope she does something different.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.

It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

It would have been better to have all the songs have a full band, or even better, a full orchestra.  I also don't like the music on "Helter Skelter."  That's what you call a song where the singer can't sing.  It's like a band where the drummer has a seizure and can't play.  It's not a good album.  I don't think it was worth the original price.

Amazon review: The Beatles are as relevant today as they were when they were alive.  I can't believe that the music is still changing.  It's not like anyone is paying attention to them anymore.  The Beatles are still a force.  This record is a reminder to me that I need to get out more.

Amazon review: The Beatles have always been a great band.  They have always been true to the spirit of their music.  They have always written great songs, and they have always shared their music with the world.  They will always be a part of my life.  I love the Beatles.  I've listened to their songs for the past three decades.  I can't wait for the next album.  I'm looking forward to the next record.  I love to listen to their music and play their music.  I love their music, and I love to listen to their music.  They have a very good voice, and they have very good musicians.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album for the past few weeks, and I must say I am pleasantly surprised.  I have listened to many of the Beatles' albums, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best.  The Beatles have never been one to be held back by their lack of commercial success.  They wrote timeless, original music, and they are always able to stand on their own.  They took their time in creating this album.  They didn't rush to get back to the studio.  Every song on this album has a unique, interesting feel to it.  I didn't expect to like this album, but I was pleasantly surprised.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best Beatles albums I have ever heard.  It has a very classic feel to it.  The music is very beautiful and enjoyable.  It's like listening to your favorite band when you have no idea who they are.  I highly recommend this album.

Amazon review: The Beatles are one of the greatest bands ever.  They have written the perfect mix of rock and soul for me.  They have been very influential in music.  The Beatles have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, and I have always looked forward to their music.  I listen to their music often.  This is the best Beatles album I had ever heard.  I can't wait to listen to it again.

Amazon review: This is the Beatles' best release.  It is well-balanced, well-sustained, and well-crafted.  It is not a perfect album, but it is a great album that can stand on its own two feet.  The Beatles are one of my favorite bands.  I love their music.  This is a great album.  I highly recommend this album.

Comments

I don't understand about the reviews for this album. I agree with the opinions of other reviewers. I really don't like this album at all. I don't understand the negative reviews about this album. The song "Love Me Do," is the one song that I like, and the rest of the songs are average. I guess I could see it being a good album for a lot of people, but it is not for me. This album was the first one I purchased on Amazon, and I don't regret it.

I don't understand about the reviews for this album. I disagree. I think that this is one of the best Beatles albums. It is great and should be placed in the pantheon of all great Beatles albums. While the songs are sometimes repetitive and uninteresting, the music and the album are fantastic. I agree with the other reviewers in that it's not the greatest album, but is definitely one of the best. The songs are catchy and the music is fun and interesting.

He sounds like he's lying on his back with a collapsed lung.  Where is the Donny Osmond version that I love?  Other versions of this soundtrack are 5 stars.  This one is terrible.

Amazon review: I was eagerly looking forward to this CD after watching Hollie on Britain's Got Talent on YouTube.  When I first played it I thought something had gone wrong with my sound system.  After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

Amazon review: I've been a massive fan of Black Sabbath since the days when they were the undisputed kings of the metal scene.  Sabbath were the original pioneers of heavy metal, and their albums were the first to include a lot of screaming and lots of music that went beyond just heavy.  So, I was looking forward to this new album, thinking that it would be a great continuation of the first five Sabbath albums, and I was really disappointed.  I can understand why the original five albums are not that popular, as they have little relevance to the present day metal scene, but it's just a shame that the new album does not have the same impact on modern metal fans.  The vocals are pretty bad, and the music itself is pretty boring.  I'm sure the band will continue to make other albums that will have a similar level of quality to Black Sabbath, but in my opinion, this album was a waste of money. 
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this band.  I've been a fan since I was a kid and was a fan of the band's first two albums, as well as many of their other albums.  I have also seen them play live multiple times, and was very impressed with their performance.  I was even more impressed with the live performance of their latest album, which I bought at the same time as the pre-order.  The band was great, and I am happy with the purchase, which was a major purchase for me.  I am a HUGE fan of the band, and am looking forward to their next album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought this was an awesome album. The guitar tones are very clear and rich.  The drumming is awesome.  The band sounds very good (with the exception of one song).  The songwriting, however, is kind of bland and average.  And the vocals are a bit weak.  Overall, this is a great album.  I would recommend it to a friend.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always been a huge fan of the band and this album is no exception.  The band's sound has always been consistent and strong, and they have been able to create some of the best guitar tones ever.  The drums have always been solid, and the bass playing has always been very powerful and well-tuned.  This album is no exception, as the guitar tone is just as clear and as rich as on their previous albums, and the drums sound great on every track.  The vocals are top notch (with the exception of one song, which is pretty weak), and the songwriting is top notch (with the exception of one song).  Overall, I think this is a great album, and I would recommend it to any metalhead who likes their music to sound great, and have a strong, powerful sound.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Black Sabbath and I saw them last night at the Boston Garden.  This show was great.  The whole crowd was into it, and they sang along to every song.  I've been a fan of the band since I was 5, and have seen them many times.  I've seen them live a couple of times, and this was not their BEST performance.  The vocals were pretty weak, and the band played a lot of the same songs over and over.  They played a few new songs, and I think they probably have a few more that I haven't seen.  Overall, they were great, and I would recommend them to anyone.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like?

Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review: I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: No Stars!!! Just the way it is.  I think the best thing about his band is he does a good job of singing with them.  I like the new album better than the older one, but neither one is outstanding.  He gets better with age and more talented.  I am sorry to see him go.

Amazon review: The first time I saw the video for "I Don't Want to Be" I was really impressed with the "rocking" style of the music video. The song is a great mix of rock, country, and hip-hop. I love it when a band uses the rock style with hip-hop to create a really great album.

Amazon review: I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of this song, I think it's a little boring and it's not the type of song that I would enjoy listening to. This album is definitely one of my favorites, it's the kind of music I would want to listen to while walking down the street.  I think this song has a lot of potential and is worth the listen.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album in a while, but I have recently taken the time to listen to it again because I can't get it out of my head.  It's not my favorite album by Alanis.  The song "A Million Suns" is my favorite.  The song "A Million Suns", though, is one of my favorites.  "A Million Suns" is one of my favorite songs.  There are many other great songs on this album.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

Amazon review: I love the Beatles, but this one's a little different.  These are all acoustic, and they're all great.  I love the song "I'm Down".

Amazon review: This album will change your life.  These songs are so good, you'll want to be a fan.  The album has a little something for everyone.   It's like you're in a studio and can pick and choose any song you want.  You're in a band, but you're not in the band anymore...you're all alone.  You feel like you're in a great band!  At the same time, you want to be alone, but you can't be!  You get really deep.  At the same time, you get really angry.   The song "I'll Never Forget You" is a little sad and a little angry at the same time.  It's very deep and the song has a great melody.   I hope this album will change you for the better.  This album has more than 40 tracks.  Its a little confusing, but it's worth it.   I'm happy with the album, and you should be too.  It'll change your life.   I had to share this album with all my friends, and I hope they can get some good tunes from it too.   It's a great album, and you should check it out.                I want to give a big THANK YOU to all the people who have been so nice to me on this album!   This album is great!               From: James H.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album probably 5-10 times so far.  I think this was the first album I've ever heard that I've been so impressed by that I wish I could have had the album as a gift.  For some reason, I was very impressed by everyone on that album.  As I was listening to this album, I realized that I had never heard anyone sound like this before.   They sounded so good together.  I realized the only reason I hadn't heard them before was because of my lack of exposure to their music.  I was shocked at how good they sounded.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

Amazon review: Not what I was looking for- I wanted a reading of the sanskrit, the word for word definitions and the translation. The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.

I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio.

The album is great but I think that there are a few songs that I could have done without and a few others that should be cut on the CD. There is a song called "The Way I Love You" that I could live without and there is "The Night I Covered It All". I do think that the song "I Will Remember You" could be cut. I feel that it's not very meaningful. I think that the album could be shortened to about 80 minutes. There are a few songs I wish they had cut on the album. There are a few songs that I could have done without. I am glad that I have been able to keep the "I Will Remember You" as it is and I do like the song.

Amazon review for: Best Alternative/pop-rock album of the last times. Best alternative and pop-rock album of the last times. With The National, the band seems to have found the way to move from the folk-rock of their debut to a heavier, and more mature song-writing, but still with a sense of humor.

Amazon review: I'm not a parent (but I play one on TV? ;), but I used to be a nanny. My 2-3yr old twins obsessed over Hi-5, and I have to say, some of their tunes were pretty darn catchy. I downloaded the songs I personally enjoyed more (you know, the ones that got stuck in *my* head all day long, that I could sing along with the show as though I'd written them myself? hah) to make a collection CD out of them, this being one of those songs; I admit, I really didn't mind (too much) having to listen to them every.

I tried saving the files in.WMA format, but when I went to click on the folder that the songs were saved in, I couldn't find the songs, so I deleted them all off the flash drive and restarted the computer.

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson.

We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review : I have bought many of her albums for my iPod and I have to say that I was very disappointed with this one. Not only do I not want to hear her music, but her voice was too high and sounded like a woman in a high school locker room.

Review by: Anonymous

I recently purchased this album and was surprised to hear that the album did not have a title on the packaging. The artwork also seems to be generic. The music was enjoyable. I purchased the album from an online music store as it had a high price. I purchased the album from Amazon.com as it had a low price. I did not realize that my purchase would be handled by another company.

I returned it. It was returned to me in a return package that was not damaged. I am very happy with the fact that I did not have to pay a shipping fee.

I would like to give this product an eight (8) out of ten (10) rating.

I purchased this album from Amazon.com and I was happy with the price. I thought that I would be happy with the songs of this album since I have heard them before. Unfortunately, I was not happy with the sound quality of the album. I am not sure what I was expecting from this artist, but her voice was very high. It sounded like a woman in a high school locker room. I was very disappointed with the sound quality of the album and I will not be purchasing any more albums from Amazon.com.

Amazon review: I am constantly amazed that today's musical groups have such little imagination that they have to cop the names of yesteryear's bands who have already earned their niches in the music world's history.. and that they do it so very badly. Bands like the People, Touch, White Witch, Armageddon,(and the list goes on and on)were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds. And yet, modern bands continue to take those names for themseles, then release inferior, common, boring music, and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the names of others.

Amazon review: Don't.  It doesn't have vocal tracks in the mix. It's a straight-up repeating beat. When I previewed it, I thought maybe there were no vocals because it was possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample. After all, it lists all of the rappers in the artist column. Wrong. WRONG. I just spent a buck on half of this song. Thanks a ton, whomever came up with this idea.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).
