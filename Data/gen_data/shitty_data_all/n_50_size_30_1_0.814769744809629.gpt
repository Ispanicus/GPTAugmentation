Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I just bought this album today. It's a big waste of money. I'm not a fan of train wreck music, but this is just a disaster. I can't even recommend it. I know it's not Meghan's fault, but this is unacceptable. She deserves better than this garbage. She should have just stayed away from music for a long time. Oh well, it's the end of an era unfortunately. She just doesn't deserve anymore success.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor - You Are Not Alone.  This is a good song, but I'm not sure I really care for it. I've never been a fan of Trainor's but I've never really listened to her music. I'm not sure why, but I don't really know her music.  I guess it's because I'm not a fan of her. I think this song was better on Alicia Keys' album.  I suppose I shouldn't have rated this negative, because I still like the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought the trainor album this week and I have to say I wasn't really impressed. The thing that really got to me is the singer not being able to pull off the vocals and the song falling apart.  The song is good, but I don't think it's her best work, and the singer is just not that great.  I also think she should have waited for more material to be recorded.  I liked some of the tracks she did in her studio, but I really don't like any of them.  It's unfortunate.  The album is about 90 minutes long, and the last track is just a train wreck.  It doesn't even have a meaning to it.  The whole album sounds like it was recorded by an idiot, and a very low quality idiot at that.  This is the train of fools that made the train wreck.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to Trainor albums before, but this is one of my favorite. I love the singer's voice.  I really like the songs. The last song is a train wreck, but I like the last song on this album much more than the rest.  I also like the fact that Trainor decided to record the album in her studio. It's cool to hear a different perspective.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like Trainor's music.  I like the fact that she can sing.  I like the fact that she can write songs.  I also like the fact that she has the courage to release her songs and go out on tour and be herself.  I don't think I'll ever buy her music.  I don't really think she is a train wreck, but I don't like her music, and I don't listen to her music.  She is my favorite singer, but I don't like her music much.  She is also my favorite artist in country music.  Her music is really good.  I don't know why I don't like it.  Why is it that I don't like her music.  I do not think she is a train wreck.  I just think she is a country music singer.  I like her music, but I just don't think she can do well in the world of country music.  I don't think she can be a great artist when she releases her music.  I don't think she can be a good artist, but I just don't think she can be a great artist either.  I have a bad feeling about her music.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I don't like it.  I am a fan of the trainor album.  I like the album.  I like the songs.  I don't like the last song on the album.  I like the songs on the trainor album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very well done album.  The title is not misleading at all.  I have to agree with the other reviewer that the album is more about the singing and not the instrumentation. This album is a perfect introduction to the Libera.  A must for all Libera fans.

Amazon review: When you are singing in the high register, you must be in great form otherwise it sounds like you are singing in a tuba.

I don't like the imagery that is in the songs.  It's not that I don't like the lyrics, it's that I don't like the imagery.  You can have the best lyrics, but if your music is too much of the same thing, it's not going to be good.  I don't know how to explain this better than that.

But I know I hate "We Can't Stop", one of the worst I've ever heard.  You either love it or hate it, but I hate it.  I don't think I've ever had a song make me feel so bad in my life.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review:  The first thing I noticed about this album was how much the vocals were changed.   The vocals were all the same, but the new band that was playing with them had a better voice.  It is a good thing that this CD will be put out for a long time, because although I love the songs, I don't think this album will hold up in the long run.   I am hoping this will just be a 2 year release and then another 2 years or so, and then another long long time.   I don't know why, but I just can't wait for the next release.

The song "Stick It Up" with the sax player has a good feeling to it.   I think I would like it if there were more songs, but I would just like to see more of the band they are with.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I will never understand why this band is playing at a festival.  They shouldn't be playing at a festival.  The first time I listened to this band was on YouTube.

Amazon review: I love their music, but they are a bunch of idiots who only play at festivals.  I'm not sure what they are trying to prove by playing at a festival.  This band is the same as most of the other bands at that festival, which was a bunch of bands who are more interested in playing music than anything else.  They are the same as most of the other bands.  I hate them, but I love them, because they are different.  I will never understand why they are playing at that festival, because I think they are wasting their time.  They are like a bunch of idiots that are playing at a festival.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I have been playing guitar for a long time, but have never had the opportunity to meet or talk to another musician my caliber.  I am very impressed with the way he's treated me.  He's given me a chance to expand my musical horizons and he's given me the opportunity to learn from one of the great guitarists of our generation.  I can't thank him enough.

The singer's voice has a unique quality that's hard to describe but easy to be aware of.  He's got a great voice and also a great look.  I have always been a fan of the Raconteurs, and I've never heard anything like them.  I can't wait to see them again.

Amazon review: I was introduced to the Raconteurs by my friend and I have to say I have been a huge fan ever since.  The drummer has a great feel and is a great drummer.  I also met the singer but I didn't get to meet him till a few weeks ago.  His voice and singing are amazing.  The bassist is great also and the guitar player is great as well.  You may not know this about me but I am a huge fan of the Beatles and the Raconteurs are one of my favorite bands.  I am a huge fan of the Raconteurs and I even have their albums on vinyl.  I am also a huge fan of Michael Jackson.  I love Jackson and you may remember I had a Jackson poster on my wall at the time the Raconteurs played at the club.  I just want to say that it was amazing and everyone in the club was singing along to the song "Crazy" and even the guys standing behind me who were not there that night were singing along to "Crazy".  So, I have to say that the Raconteurs are one of my favorite bands.  They have a great sound, a great look and a great song list.  I can't wait to see them again.  Thanks for listening and we'll catch you next time.

Amazon review: I wanted to buy the Raconteurs CD but the first cd that I saw was a mistake, the second cd was a mistake, and the third cd was a mistake.  The CD that I wanted to get was the CD that I was able to get, only the last 5 minutes of.  I thought I was going to be disappointed because it was not the original cd, but it was, it had a lot of songs on it that I wanted, and a lot of good songs.  I think that the CD that I got was the original cd.  I also really liked the CD that I got, but I had to listen to it for a while before I could actually buy it.  I tried my best to listen to it before I finally purchased it, but I have to say that it's not the CD that I want, but it's the CD that I had.  I have always loved the Raconteurs songs and this CD is no different, the only reason that I say that is because the album is not my favorite album, and I don't really like the songs that are on it.  The whole album is only 3 songs long, and I don't really like the CD.  But, I am glad that I bought it, I have been a fan of the Raconteurs for a long time and I am very happy with this CD.  It's a good CD, it's not the CD that I want, but it's the CD I have.  I really want the next CD, but I don't know when that will be.  The Raconteurs are really good, they really are.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: this album is awesome. i bought it at a store that was selling old vinyl records and they had it on sale. i thought, "well, this is the only album i will ever listen to." i bought the album and then, a few weeks later i started checking the website for the album and saw that the album had disappeared. i looked on the website and i saw that they were deleting the older vinyl records from the site and that seemed awful. i had to find a way to download this album again. i found a link to a band and put in the band's name and when i clicked it it downloaded the album. i am very grateful to the band for giving me the right to download this album. i have given this album to my friends and they have all said that it is one of my favorites. i love it. i will never purchase any of the albums from this band but i will definitely buy this one.

Amazon review: I have seen a lot of reviews on this album and it seems pretty positive, but I don't think it deserves a 5 star review. I have been listening to this song for the last four days.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
