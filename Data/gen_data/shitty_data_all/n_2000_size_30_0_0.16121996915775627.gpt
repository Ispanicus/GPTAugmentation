Amazon review: i liked this song until I watched the video.  Come on.  Then Robin Thicke got twerked on by Miley.  Ugh. While his wife played it cool for a while, eventually she left him. And finally he says he has addiction issues.  Am I the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movies where the singer/actor's personal life interfere's with my opinion of the actual song/movie?  (See:  Anything by Amy Winehouse; all things Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow or Rihanna)

Amazon review:  So I've been trying to get my wife to stop watching videos where the guy singing/playing the guitar is the same age as his girlfriend, and is about 5'9".  I just can't.  I've tried all the "time is money" excuses, and now I've resorted to the "my girlfriend is hot" excuse.  Anyway, this song is pretty bad.  The guitar solo is awful.  The voice just doesn't sound right.  I hate it.  I really hate it.  I really hate it.

Amazon review: I feel sorry for the guy.  He has a young girlfriend, and the video shows the two of them having a good time.  However, he is still single, and now he's seen the video.  He's seen the video, and he's been in love, and he just can't get over it.

Amazon review: I feel sorry for the guy with a girlfriend who doesn't like rock 'n roll.  It must be hard to get over someone like that.  I hear this song and I think of my girlfriend and I think of a few things:  She's a great girl, and she loves me,  She likes me,  But she doesn't love me.  I think of her sitting at her kitchen table, the lights out, and a blanket over her shoulders, but she doesn't know I'm sitting there, thinking about her.  And I think about the times when I was with other girls, and how I thought I was in love with the one I was with, but I wasn't.  I think about the times she was with other guys, and how she was with me, but I wasn't.  I think about the time we went on vacation together, and how much we loved each other, and how we didn't love each other.  And I think about the times we were alone, and how much we loved each other, and how we didn't really love each other.  And I think about the times we were alone together, and how much we loved each other, and how we didnnot really love each other.

Amazon review: I love what I hear from Robin Thicke.  He has a new single out, and it's pretty good.  I think it's the best song I've heard in a long time.  The guitar solo is also really good.  He is a great vocalist.  He can sing a tune, and he can sing it really good.  I really like his voice.  I don't know how he does it, but he can sing a song really good.  The song is great, but I have a couple of problems with it.  1) The song is too long.  2) The song is a bit too slow.  3) The song has some lyrics.  4) The song is not a "real" song.  I know what the song is about,

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.  Also, you get to hear his more "straight up" distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly, stylized singing style on many of his recordings (not that there's anything wrong with that!) It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

A:

Your problem is that you are using an incorrect regex pattern. You are using * to find all instances of " " in the string, but you don't want to match " " at the beginning of the string, either.
So change (.*" ")|(.*\")|(.*\r\n)*|(\r\n)* to (.*" ")|(.*\")|(.*\r \n)*|(\r \n)* (and please, please please don't use.* to match all instances of " ", or you'll be having a world of trouble down the road).
Note: I've made the change just in case you didn't notice the difference, and if you still don't see the difference, just change the pattern back to (.*" ")|(.*\")|(.*\s*\s*)|(\s\s*)

 
The first match will be from (.|\r|\n)* (matching any character between the first and last occurrence of ",), and the second match will be from the rest of the string (matching any character not included in the first match).
However, in your case, you want to match " " at the beginning of the string, so change it to (.*")|(.*\")|(.*\r\n)*|(\n\r)* (and please, please don't use.* to match all instances of ",).

A:

I'm going to make an assumption here, as you didn't specify the language you're using.
This is due to the fact that you haven't escaped the parentheses in the first argument of your regex.
So instead of:
(.*" ")|(.*\")|(.*\r\r)|(\r\n)*

Try this:
(.*" ")|(.*\")|(.*\\)|(\r\n)*

Notice the double backslash in the last line. This is to escape the backslash if you are in a string with a backslash.
If you are in some other language, you may see the extra backslashes.

A:

Try
(\s*"(.*\")|(.*\r\n)*)|(\r\n)*

\s* means any whitespace character, so you can use \s to replace all whitespaces in your string.
\"(.*\")|(.*\r\n)*)

is the same as (.*" ")|(.*\")|(.*\r\\n)*|(\r\\n)*

 
Note that if you want to use this pattern as a Regex, you need to escape the backslash in the last argument with a backslash, as \r\n is a newline character.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: This song is really, really, really nice.  So much so that I would purchase this album just for the cover art.  The lyrics are too (mostly) upbeat and not too down-beat to warrant a downer tune, but the background vocals and the simple, straight-forward arrangement help to take the listener's mind off the sadness that is at the heart of "I'm Yours" (and perhaps the album at large).   I've always been a huge fan of Jim Reeves.  I love his voice, and this song is right up my alley.  He's so underrated.

Amazon review: I heard this song first on the radio, and it was catchy.  I didn't buy it, but I was pleasantly surprised when I heard it on the CD.  I've always loved Jim Reeves.    I'm a fan of the old school country music, and I enjoy what I hear from old school artists.    I am a huge fan of Johnny Cash, and I think this is one of his better songs.    I'm not a fan of the other artists on the album.    I hope they don't come too close to the original.    I've always been a fan of Jim Reeves.  I'm a big fan of his music, and this album is great.  I wish more people would support Reeves.  I've always been a fan of him.    I have been a fan of his music since the early days of his career.    I used to go to his concerts when I was a kid.

Amazon review: It's great to hear an artist expand their horizons. I just wish Jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what I mean. Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: This is a great song!!!   I've been a fan of this band since "I See Stars"  I've gone back and forth on the CD but this song is awesome   I love the fact that it is a duet between two singers that I've never heard before.  The song is good and has a good beat.  The only thing that I don't like is the "Hush" chorus.  It's not exactly a surprise that it's there but it's the kind of thing that gets stuck in your head and you just can't shake it.  I'm glad they got rid of it.

Amazon review: I am not a huge Pink Floyd fan, but this song is one of the things that keep me going.  To me, it is a beautiful song that is just not played enough.  It is one of those songs that is played so often that you almost forget about it.  So when I find a song like this that I would like to listen to, I try to make the effort to find it.  This song is very nice and not to many people know about it.  Thanks for sharing it with us.  My only complaint is that it is a little too long.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  A little bit of the more romantic side of Zappa (i.e. the side that has yet to be tapped by the modern mainstream of music).  At first, I was a little disappointed by the lack of a more up-tempo, rock-oriented song. But as it kept playing after I turned it off, I was pleasantly surprised by the more laid back, slow-paced, and reflective song that eventually ended up on the end.  It is a little slow, but that's not why I rated it.  The song was just what I was looking for.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is an excellent album.  I really like this album, and especially the songs "The Biggest Party", "Dress", and "Spirits."  This album is a great addition to your collection.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I was very disappointed with this album.  This was my first album from Zappa and at times it felt like it was a compilation of his previous albums.  The first song to be played was "Kashmir", and it was not very well received.  A lot of his other songs did not do very well either.  Then I remembered that Zappa had recorded another album at the same time that was much better received.  I tried to listen to the album that he recorded that didn't do so well, but I couldn't get past the songs "Pussy Cats" and "Riot in Cell Block 9."  This album didn't do much for me.  I think that it is an excellent album, but it's not worth the time or money that it costs to purchase.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is the only CD by Zappa that I own, so I've never heard this album.  I was disappointed to read so many negative reviews from other reviewers.  I really enjoyed the album, and I can only assume that others were disapointed with the album.  I do think that this is a great album, and it's definitely worth the time and money to purchase it.  It has some excellent songs on it, and I personally think that it will be a great addition to any album collection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is a must-have for any Zappa fan.  It's a shame that the rest of the world doesn't have access to this album.  It's got some great songs, and I was surprised at the amount of covers.  The most underrated song on this album is "Big Bottom" by Rufus Wainwright.  It's a great song, and many people don't know it.  "Punky's Dance" is also a good song.

I downloaded the songs I personally enjoyed more (you know, the ones that got stuck in *my* head all day long, that I could sing along with the show as though I'd written them myself? hah) to make a collection CD out of them, this being one of those songs; I admit, I really didn't mind (too much) having to listen to them every.

Hopefully it won't come up in random very often.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas.

But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.

Amazon review:  I like the vocals on this one. It's the one I like best on the album. I don't think I've heard anything like it from her.  But, I'm sure that's not the point.  I like the songs and the music.  But,  I'm not looking for any new material from Sheryl Crow.  I'm  just looking for a few of her  favorite songs that I can listen to again when I have free time.

Amazon review: The first song I chose was "Crazy" and I am really disappointed that it isn't longer.  I do like the song, but I was expecting one of the longer songs or at least a song with a chorus.  But, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, because the first part of the song wasn't long.  But,  I guess I'm going to have to learn to listen to the song with less expectation.  I hope the song is longer in the future, because  it is, but I'd like to hear some more songs with a chorus like "Crazy", "The Other Woman" or "What's Your Name".   My favorite song of hers is "The Middle".  I don't know why I'm not sure about that one.  I like the rest of them.  I like "The House" and "Highway Don't Care".  I like "It's All Your Fault" and "This Ain't A Love Song".  "Saving All My Love For You" is my favorite out of all the songs on the CD.   I really don't know why, but I like the song.  I'm not even sure why, but I think I  like it.  I'm not sure what songs are supposed to be like "all your fault" and "this ain't a love song" or "highway don't care" or "it's all your fault".  But, I don't care about that part of the song.  I don't even really care about the rest of it.   If you don't like any of the songs, don't buy it!

Amazon review: I love the songs on this CD. I have two favorites.   "How To Save A Life" is  a great song that brings up a lot of memories for me.  I have been to a lot of funerals,  and I have seen a lot of people who are very sick in hospitals.   "I Will Be There"  is a very sad song.  I like it because it really shows what a difference  it makes when someone really cares about someone else.

I especially like "I Can't Make You Love Me" and "When You Say Nothing At All".   I like "Swingin' The Blues" a lot.   I really like it.   I like it a lot.   I like it a lot.  I like it a lot.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Amazon review:  I love this album, it reminds me of the 80's.  The lyrics are perfect.  My favorite is "If you want to be happy, love me," and "Forget it, don't think about it," and "If you don't love me, forget about it."  This is music to my soul.  The title track "I'm a liar" is a song by Cher, but I love it.  And, "The man who got the girl" is also a song by Cher, and I love it.  The song is very simple, perfect for a rainy day, or waiting for a long drive.
