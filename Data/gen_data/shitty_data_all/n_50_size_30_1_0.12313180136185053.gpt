Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like the song.  I don't like Meghan Trainor singing, and the lyrics to "When You Are Gone" are probably not very true to what she means.  If you like Trainor's music, then this is good, but not great.  I like the music and the lyrics, but the song is not what I expected.

Amazon review: I like this CD.  I wanted to like it, but I just don't.  The song is great, and it is very well-written.  But it just isn't what I expected.  I don't like the song "Someday."  But overall the songwriting is really good.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this CD.  I think it is a good song.  It is one I would listen to again.  I think the lyrics are good, and most of the parts are written correctly.

I like the lyrics, and I like Meghan Trainor's voice.

Amazon review: I like this album.  I really like the song "Something To Believe In."  I didn't know the song was going to be about having a baby.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Trainor.  I think her voice is good, but I don't think her singing is great.  I didn't like this song very much.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Singing Christmas Carols

Christmas Carols Singing by Bob Merrill

Christmas Carols Singing by Bob Merrill

With his new recording of Christmas Carols, Bob Merrill is continuing his tradition of singing holiday tunes.

Amazon.com review: Bob Merrill, a versatile singer-songwriter and accomplished pianist who has recorded both under his own name and for others, has released a new CD of holiday tunes. The CD contains three songs, "The Christmas Song," "Merry Christmas" and "Jingle Bells." The other three are "O Little Town of Bethlehem," "O Come, All Ye Faithful" and "O Come, All Ye Faithful."

Amazon.com review: This is a collection of old and new Christmas carols, some of which are very familiar. One of them is "The Christmas Song," one is the traditional "O Little Town of Bethlehem," and two are versions from the 1940s. The tunes are very light and easy to sing. The album is recorded in a traditional style and it has a friendly feeling to it. There is a nice piano accompaniment and some good guitar.

Amazon.com review: Bob Merrill is a master of vocal style and has a great command of melody and rhythm. His voice is a good medium of tone and he has a good sense of rhythm as well.

Amazon.com review: The album opens with the traditional "O Little Town of Bethlehem," followed by "O Come, All Ye Faithful." The last song is an original called "Jingle Bells." At first, these three songs are all very similar, but after a few minutes, "Jingle Bells" becomes a distinct addition to the repertoire.

Amazon.com review: Bob Merrill is a master of songs that appeal to a wide range of people. This includes everyone from young children to older adults. The album opens with "O Little Town of Bethlehem," which is a very familiar song. The next two are more original. In fact, "O Come, All Ye Faithful" is one of the most beautiful songs of the season. This song is a song of praise and is a wonderful way to start the evening.

Amazon.com review: If you are looking for a light, easy going, and very appealing Christmas album, this is it. Bob Merrill is an extremely talented singer. His voice is a good medium of tone and he has a good grasp of melody and rhythm. Even though he has been singing for a long time, his singing is

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I was not a huge fan of The Smithereens during their first two albums.  I like the band and they are great live performers.  But I didn't really like their second album and  The Smithereens in the later 2000's has been a disappointment.  However, it was not their fault that the label decided to change their sound (or rather, abandon it) to  more alternative rock and do not like the fact that the band is so alternative rock.  They did not like it and wanted to change it and the band was unwilling to do it. The band also has been on a  string of bad luck,  which included their manager and two members getting sued.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As I have stated in other reviews, I am a fan of the Smithereens.  As I stated before, I bought this CD as a Christmas gift for my Mother (I know that I'm not supposed to post reviews on things that I bought for my mother but I bought it for her anyway) and I thought that it was a good cd,  I haven't heard anything else by the band since this cd.  I don't listen to the band that often other than the cd and they have some good songs.  The song "I'm Not Dead" was the best song  that I have ever heard.  The band sounds so alive and their songs are really catchy.  I wish there were more songs to listen to.  It is really good to hear the band in their prime and with all of their talent.

Amazon review: It's hard to tell.  These are the type of tunes that sound like a bunch of guys playing with other guys.  The vocals  are very simple and do not  project a strong "voice" at all.  The  song structure is very simple too.  The  band is  not a big deal; just a bunch of guys who can play.  The sax player (who I think  is the only real talent in the group) is  also a little disappointing.  He's good, but he's not a real talent.  I think he is there to fill a need and not really show off.  His instrument doesn't have much personality.  Other than that, the music is very forgettable.  It has a lot of the same things that I hear in other cheapie hip-hop CDs.  I'd give it 3 stars but I'm not a fan of the sound of these guys.  They're not bad but not that great either.

I found I could  still learn the things, but I did not learn the concepts.  For example, I tried to play chords on the piano, but I could not.  I could do them on the guitar, but not on the piano.  I also found that I could learn the song structure by ear in the first few pages, but not the actual song structure.  I have always had trouble keeping time and I had to memorize the song structure, but the songs did not hold much of the information.  I think that the CD could have been much better if it had a more complex structure.

I'd have to agree, the first song has a great hook to it and the rest are pretty good. But the album overall is a complete waste of time because the production is so bad it is almost comical.  The album also has a really bad cover of I Know What I Like by The Kinks and for some reason that song has no video.  The album features 4 songs in the middle of the album that are not even close to being bad.  I'd have to go back to 2002 for better production and better song writing.  But this is a great CD, it's just sad the band is currently working on their 1st full length album and should have their 1st number 1 in the US.  I'd recommend this album to anyone who enjoys a good song.  I really don't like the cover of I Know What I Like, it was comical and I thought it was a parody of the movie, but the band did a great cover.  The sound quality is great and the songs are all good.  I'll give the band a 9 out of 10.  I think they could have done better but I still give the album a 4 out of 10.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of songs by various artists, as a fan of the band I have been waiting on a full length release of this for years.  The first song is a good one, it's a good mix of acoustic and electronic.  I really liked the song but the rest are just average.  Overall 3/10
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a cool compilation of songs but not a real compilation.  The only song I can really listen to is "Naked in the Rain", it's a real song and a great remix made by an unknown artist.  It's a good album and a little boring at times but it's worth a listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this when they first came out, and I was really disappointed.  I think I was just being picky.  I don't know what they wanted me to buy, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  It's not even a good CD, the sounds are just weird and the production is horrible.

Amazon review: This is one of those CDs that doesn't deserve a positive review.  I had to stop listening to it because I didn't know what to think.  The songs are really, really, really bad.  I'd give the album a 2 out of 10.  It doesn't deserve a positive review.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's funny that I'm the only one here voting for this song. I know I probably should've voted it up, but I just haven't been feeling it.

What I'd really like to hear is the following:

1. A full-length album

2. A song with more of a chorus in it

3. A song that isn't this generic and overused

4. A song with a little bit of a beat

5. A song that isn't all over the place

6. A song with a good lyrics

7. A song with a positive vibe

8. A song with a positive attitude

9. A song that is actually catchy

10. A song with a good tempo

Thank you for voting, I know I'm not the only one who has been wanting this for quite some time.

I would love for this album to have the following qualities:

1. A full-length album, but also an EP with songs that are about 3-4 minutes long.

2. A song with more of a chorus in it
You probably mean "a song that has an intro and then a chorus", but I would really like this album to have an EP. It would be awesome if you added a song with an intro then a chorus, but

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think that Meghan is very talented.  She is not afraid to take risks and move away from her previous stuff.  I'm glad that she's opening up again.  She is one of the few artists that I follow that keeps going.  I think that she has a lot of stuff to offer.  I haven't thought too much about this album.  I think that it has potential because of her talent, and I would love to see her move away from her previous material to bring out new material.  I think that when Meghan makes another album, which I hope she does, that it will be better than this one. I hope that this album will be worth the money.  I think that Meghan is going to do good things.  I hope that she has a successful career.  She is a talented musician.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:
I have been waiting a long time to buy this album, it's been a very long wait. I have listened to it for about 2 weeks now. I am very disappointed in this album, I'm not an "Alex Lacamore" fan, I don't know if he is even involved with this album, but it is a great album, I have listened to it every day since I got it, and I still got the same feeling that I feel from it that I got when I got it.
So, yes, I am very disappointed with this album because it is not what I imagined it to be.
I have listened to it over and over, and I love when I listen to it, but I feel like I've heard it before.
It's not a bad album, it's not a good album, it's not a bad album. It's just not what I expected.
I listen to it every day and it brings me the same feeling that I had when I first heard it.
I don't understand why people say that this album is a "come-back" or "come-back" album. What I mean is, it's not a "come-back" album. It's not a "come-back" album, it's a "come-back" album, but it's not the same as what I expected at all.
I feel like I've heard this album over and over before, there is nothing new, there is not anything unique about it, and I'm disappointed in this album because it's not what it promised to be, and I don't think they did a very good job.
The first 4 or 5 songs are really good, but after that it's kind of boring and a little disappointing. I don't think they did a very good job on the songs.
So, what is the point of this album? I wish it was just an album. I wish it was just a "come-back" album, but I think it's a "come-back" album, but I don't think it's a "come-back" album, it's just not what it promised to be.
Sorry my review is a little bit long, but I don't know what else to say, I hope that you all understand what I'm saying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album starts off with a great track, "I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)." The problem is that the rest of the album slows down and becomes repetitive. The best track is the closing song, a bit of a throwaway, but it's still a good song. The rest of the album is OK.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Bella Hadid will be making her first appearance in the American Music Awards next month - she'll be hosting the ceremony on June 22nd.
A source tells US Weekly that the 22-year-old is currently 'working on a ton of projects' and 'is definitely not dating anyone in Hollywood.'
We've reached out to Hadid's reps for comment.

The 22-year-old is the first major star to be announced for the ceremony.

She will be performing her hit single "Bitch Better Have My Money" at the ceremony on June 22 at Nokia Theatre in Toronto.

She'll be joined by fellow American Idol alumni Adam Lambert and Clay Aiken.

Hadid has been a vocal supporter of the LGBT community.

She previously posted a picture of herself with Jennifer Lopez and her ex-boyfriend Ricky Martin on Instagram, in which Lopez is seen wearing a rainbow-striped shirt.

Hadid posted the picture with the caption: 'I love you @jenniferlopez #rainbow #monday #love'

The singer and actress was previously dating ex-boyfriend Louis Tomlinson - who was pictured with Hadid wearing a rainbow-striped shirt on Instagram.

The singer has been dating her boyfriend Liam Hemsworth since November.

The pair have been dating for over a year and they have a son, Moses Henry Hemsworth, who they welcomed back in April.

Last October, Miley Cyrus opened up about how she's been dealing with the aftermath of a break-up with Liam Hemsworth.

"I'm still dealing with this break up in the best way I know how," she captioned a series of photos on Instagram.

"I'm with my son who is my world and I feel so lucky to have him with me."
