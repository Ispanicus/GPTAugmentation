Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think this is a good idea.  I don't think it would be a good idea to use the word "bad" in a negative review.  The song is not bad.  The band is not bad, they are not good.  But that's not what "bad" means.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A classic comedy about a man in a small town who thinks he's got the world by the tail. He's so full of confidence in his small town views, that he just assumes everyone else is as stupid and small-town as he is.  He believes this, because he's been told so by everyone he meets in his small town and his view has become that of the majority.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good song.  I actually found it funny.  The only thing that made it funny was that George and I both knew what the song was about.  I thought it was hilarious and thought it was funny when I first heard it.  The only thing that really didn't make it funny was the fact that the band was not playing very well.  When I first heard the song I thought it was a flop.  When I first heard the band play the song I thought it was a hit.  This song was a hit.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The one and only cover of the song.  The only song that was played by this band that I really liked.  I think that this band has a very good chance of being on CD again.  They might be a good band and they might be a great band.  I really wish that they would just release their original album or something.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.  I just don't know.  I don't know what I'm supposed to think about this.  I don't know what I'm supposed to feel about this.  I don't know what I'm supposed to feel.  It doesn't really matter.  I don't care.  I just don't know.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another cover of a song that I really like.  I have nothing to complain about.  I like this band, they have a good message, and I like their message, and I like the way they play, and the fact that they had the guts to cover a song that is really just a cover is awesome.  I don't think that I would ever listen to a song that is completely just a cover again.  But for some reason I do care.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The cover of this song is very good.  The band was really good, and they were not afraid to play a song that they probably should have played more.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was excited to see this CD get released, because I really liked "Love You Like That."  But after having listened to this CD, I am not sure if I have the same feelings as before.  After all, I've heard Josh sing "My Favorite Things" several times.  And I love that song.  But I'm not sure I like what he is doing here.  I just don't feel that there is anything original about the songs.  I wish he had at least tried to keep the songs more upbeat, but perhaps he was just trying to do a "different" album?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed the album. I loved the first song, but I really love the last two songs.  I like the fact that the album is all original.  The only problem is that the album is a little too short.  I would have liked to have seen more music videos.  I would have like to have seen a live performance in one of the videos of one of the songs.  But overall, this album is a great starting point for any musician.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for two reasons: 1. To hear Chuck Smith sing "Papa Was A Rolling Stone" (which is one of the worst songs ever recorded) and 2. To hear a woman sing "I'm So Happy" (which is even worse). So I decided to give it a listen and found that, while the song "I'm So Happy" was a little better than the original, there was nothing worth listening to on the rest of the album.

I love it.  I would buy it again.  He's a great singer, and I love the way he sings, but he's just not a Josh album.  He's not as great as in his earlier albums.  I think he should change his style.  But as it is I love it.  I can't get past the fact that he's singing in a different voice.  But I love his voice, and it's really beautiful.  I still enjoy it.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

I used to listen to music (mostly oldies) and watch music videos, but not in a way that I would compare with being a participant in the music (I'm not a musician). My favourite is probably "You Don't Have To Say You Love Me" by The Who. I've never heard anything like it, and it's a very powerful piece of music. The way the band plays it, the way they sing it, the way it's mixed, and also the story they tell it. It's something that will stick with you for many, many years.

I was amazed at how powerful the song was, how it shook me to my core, and how it took me back to my childhood.

Amazon review: I have been a subscriber to this service for a long time now. Over the years, I have been very happy with the service. I have used it on 3 different machines. This latest purchase, I did not try on a new machine, however, I did use on my old machine. I was not impressed when I tried it on the first machine. I thought I had better luck with the second machine.
My issue is that the music was not loud enough to play the way I wanted to. It was very quiet and I was only hearing the sound of the music. When I got to the last few tracks, I could hear the music and it was much louder. I was also able to hear the bass, but I could not hear the high end of the sound. It was very faint and when I was listening at home, I could not even hear it from the other room.
I have to say I was very disappointed with this purchase. This is a very nice product, however, I was not happy with the results I was getting from it.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a fan of most of the music he has released (especially the new one), but this is not what bothers me.  For me, it is the fact that his voice is so bad, that I can't get the point of it.  I love the music and will purchase the rest of his album, but it doesn't matter to me.  The voice and the music only matter to me when it is done the way it should be done.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is so sad.  I have been a big fan of this man for a long time and, you know, I have been waiting for his music to come out for quite a while.  Well, he has released something and, it is just so bad.  I will listen to it, of course, but, I will never buy the thing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a GREAT album!  I love the old school reggae sound that he has used in his earlier recordings.  This is a really good album.  I will purchase it and listen to it many, many time.  Very nice!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of this man for some time now, and he has always been pretty good to me (especially the earlier albums), but this is just plain wrong.  This is the most offensive album I have ever heard and I will not purchase it.  The songs are just horrible and the production seems to be from a low-rent recording studio.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "It's not about the money...it's about the music."  Not sure if this is true, but one thing I do know is that you can't sell a product that you don't believe in.  This is not a very good album and I will not purchase it.  The music has no soul or any real soul to it at all.  The music is just bad.  It is not worth the money you spent on this album.  I will not purchase it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a bad album.  It is not a bad album, but, I don't think it is a good album at all.  This is a lot of hype and it is too bad, because the songs are pretty good.  The only thing that this album does not have is a great production.  The vocals are so bad, that, the songs sound like they are recorded in a low-rent recording studio, with no soul at all.  All in all, this is a pretty good album, but I just don't think it is worth the money, which I paid for this album.  I will not purchase it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  Hey, man, are you kidding me?  This album is a joke.  The worst song on the album, is #28 "If You Don't Come Back".  The second worst song on this album, is the third track on the album, "Ain't Gonna Make It".  The worst song on this album are the last two tracks on the album.  These songs are just bad but, they are still good.  "Just a Little Bit" is pretty good, while "Don't Stop" is pretty bad.  This is a joke.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is good!  The worst song on it, is the song called "Don't Stop Don't Stop".  This song is not very good at all, but, the last song on the album, "Ain't Gonna Make It", is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, bad!  The second worst song on this album, is the song called "Ain't Gonna Make It", which, is just not good at all.  I cannot listen to this album, because I just cannot listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
