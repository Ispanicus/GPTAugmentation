Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I love the way that this album sounds. The lead vocals are the best of the disc. I especially like the slow bluesy rock guitar from the opening track until the first chorus. The song has a "real" feel. I can't wait until this album is released. It is going to rock!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

This is an excellent song! I thought it was really good and I want to give my own opinion, but I am just not sure how to put it. It's easy to like, easy to sing along to, but not good in a musical sense. The lyrics are good, especially the last line. I like how the song starts with the line "No matter what, I know we're gonna make it. We'll make it." I like the whole song, but I don't think it's a hit. I thought it was pretty good. It's nice and simple and it's a little different from most songs. They are definitely not as fun as the songs that I can't wait to buy. I just wish they would learn to write better songs. I really like this song, I just wish that they had more songs like this. I liked this song a lot.

This is not a good song. It's too short (9 minutes), the song is not a hit. I tried to download it twice, and each time, it would say that it was too short. I can't believe that they would release this song on iTunes for 99 cents. I'm not sure what to make of this song.

I like this song. It's very good. The singer's voice is also good. The song is not a hit.

I don't know what to say about this song yet. It's a little different from most of the other songs, but I think it could be a hit. The lyrics are good, and it's short.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I am a long-time fan of Christian music.  I like bands like Casting Crowns, Hillsong United, The Worship Collective, and many others.  The singing is pretty good.  I don't like the lyrics because they seem to be very general.  They are also very long, and very difficult to understand because they use a lot of repeated words.  I have learned that to understand them, I have to be able to listen to the singers and pay attention to what they are saying.  I am very disappointed with this CD.  I have seen many videos on YouTube that are of the concerts, and I have to say, they are just not good videos.  It is not the same as sitting in the concert hall and hearing the wonderful music.  The only thing I like about the videos is that they show the singers smiling, and the audience cheering.  The music is good, but it is not the same as hearing it live.  I am very disappointed.

The music is very nice, but the sound is distorted and it seems that the singers are having a hard time making out what they're saying.  I think this CD would have been better if I had not purchased it.  I would not buy it again.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Christian music since the early 70's.  I was introduced to worship and praise music in the early 80's.  I have been very fortunate to have had the opportunity to attend various Christian concerts and events.  Even though I have not been able to attend every concert and event, I have made it a point to see and hear as many as possible.  I have to say that I am very disappointed with this CD.  I have listened to most of the songs that were available on the CD several times over the last few weeks.  I heard the songs that were on the CD several times and I was disappointed each time.  However, I am a little disappointed that I have to listen to the songs again to be able to give a review on them.  The singing is very choppy and the lyrics are too general.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I then started to delete it from my Music folder but I kept it. I then listened to it on my phone, and thought, "Wow, this is an amazing song." I then went to bed and thought, "I need to have this one on my iPod."  I have it on my iPod because it is my new favorite song.  I love it.  I have been singing this song for many years. I am a musician, so I love music.  I love the lyrics, "The King in Me," "I am the king in your soul."  It is that I am the king of your life.  I am the King in your life.  It was hard for me to find this song on iTunes, so I searched it on Amazon. I looked for a song called "The King in Me" which was on the main page of Amazon, and I saw the song on the search results of the search.  I clicked on it and it said "Buy it now."  I searched again in the search results and I found "The King in Me" in the search results again.  I clicked on it and it said "Buy it now."

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I like this album a lot. I think it's a really good addition to her discography.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I purchased this as a gift for myself as I never had this opera in the theater. I didn't know much about it but I have read reviews and listened to it several times ( I also read the reviews on the video). It was really good. I had a hard time finding it on iTunes so I listened to it on the radio as well. The music is very good. The story is very well written and the opera itself is very well done. I would recommend it!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I love the album. It has great songs and the vocals are perfect. The guitars are nice and the band is great. There is only one thing that I don't love about this album. There is a song called "Walking In The Rain" is about a man who left his wife and two kids. The song is about that very real situation. I hate that song. It is very sad and I can't stand it. If anyone has a copy of this album it would be a shame if this is replaced by a better song.

My husband is an avid fan of this band, but he doesn't listen to it - too much music!

The lyrics are also very memorable.

Amazon review: This was my first Dallas Holm album, and I loved it. I found out about it from another blog that said it was the best album of the year. I love their voice and their music. I listened to this album over and over. I like it because it's different from their other albums. I like the way they do a lot of the instrumentation and use a lot of acoustic instruments. The last song on this album, "Lonely Man", is a song that I really liked. I'm not sure why, but I just like it. I'm not sure if it is the song itself or if it's the lyrics to the song. The song is about being alone, and I like that the song has a lot of meaning to it.

Amazon review: I am very picky about what music I purchase. I am not a big fan of most of the mainstream stuff out there.

It is a great mix of folk, bluegrass, and rock. The band is super tight, and the songs are incredibly catchy. The lyrics are fun and there are a lot of positive messages in the songs. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this album.

And it's not just me, I've heard songs from that album that are just as good.  And it's not just me, other people have also said the album is better than AI 2006/2007.  I just don't understand why people are so mean to this band.  I think on the other hand, I just don't understand why people think this is a bad album...

Amazon review: I would like to state that I am from the Midwest and I have never had a problem with a company that ships things outside of the U.S.  I love Hall and Oates music and it has always been a good experience when ordering from a company out of the U.S.  I ordered a CD from USA Today about a week ago.  I had to call them and order it online, and it was shipped out without a problem.  I have received a CD from USA Today before, and that was the same shipment they sent to me.  I have been a customer of Hall and Oates for many years and I have always had a good experience.  I went through the same process to order from USA Today, and they sent the CD without a problem.  I am not sure why I had a problem with this company.  I will try to contact them and see what they have to say.  I also want to mention that I ordered from a UK website and I did not have any trouble with the delivery.  They shipped it out without a problem.  I am just trying to find out why I had problems with the shipping company.  I love Hall and Oates music and I would like to see them succeed.  They are the best song that I have ever heard.  I think they should all go together.  I hope that this is a problem that is fixed.  I would like to say thank you to the shipping company that delivered the CD to me, and I will not be ordering anything from this company again.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

What do you mean by "too short"? I know you're talking about the lyrics, but if you mean the length of the songs, then I don't agree with you. The songs are very long, but the lyrics are short. If you think that the lyrics are too short, then you should listen to the CD with headphones. You'll find that they're not too short. And, there's no problem.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The story is that, Bob Johnson (Robert Johnson) was a legendary blues artist from the South.  He was known for his soulful, high-pitched voice.  When his mother decided to sell her store, she needed money.  So she asked Bob to sell some of his songs.  What happened next would change the music industry forever.  Johnson refused.  He turned down the offer and went to prison.  The song that is playing now is a song he wrote called "It Doesn't Matter", a song that was originally recorded by the late, great Paul Butterfield.  Bob Johnson's story is a sad one.  He was a pioneer of the blues and when he was in prison, he wrote this song.  Although the story is sad, the song itself is awesome.  I've heard it over and over again and it never gets old.  It's great.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I wish I could give this a positive review but it is true.  I got this as a free download. It is a very sad song.  Robert Johnson is a legend and was one of the greatest bluesmen in the world.  He was a poet, a songwriter, an actor, a dancer, and a painter.  I have seen his movies and read his books.  His voice sounds like it comes off of a big old oak tree.  His song "It Doesn't Matter" is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard.  I am glad I got this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have never been a big Robert Johnson fan but this song was something else.  I can't say I was disappointed in the song because I believe it is a good song.  I do think the music video looks like it could have come from the 70s.  The song definitely has an old-time feel to it.  Of course, it is a sad song but it is a good song.  I have added it to my collection of songs.
