Daft Punk - Random Access Memories (1/2)

Daft Punk - Random Access Memories (1/2) is the third single from the album Random Access Memories, released on March 6, 2010 on the French label Polydor Records in partnership with Sony Music Entertainment.

The video was directed by Marc Kleiman, who previously directed the video for Blondfire's "Blonde". The song was also released as a single, along with "One More Night", and was the first single to be released through iTunes in France.

The song was the fifth in a series of six, each corresponding to a stage in the album's story.

The song was inspired by the album's concept of a'memory' which is then used in the song to create a new memory, called "Recycled Memories".

"Random Access Memories" achieved a top-ten position on several European charts, including the singles charts in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It reached the top-three position in the UK and the top-ten position in Ireland, where it was certified Platinum.

Critical reception
The song received mixed reviews from critics.

Ben Rayner from NME gave the song 6/10 and wrote: "Daft Punk's new single is not as special as its predecessor, it

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of E.S.Posthumus. I like this album.  I also like to play his music.  I don't think there is any song on this album that should NOT be played.  I think most people will enjoy it.  It is basically the r n b/jazz/soul fusion he is known for. I like that they are doing a 3 disc set because it is an excellent album.  I like the fact that it is playing live.  If you like r n b, you will like this.  It is not a bad CD.  It is a good CD.  I do feel that it should have been released as one CD.  I think you could have had a nice cd package with the 3 CDs in it.  The first one is a good cd, the second one is a good cd.  I think you just got a bad cd.  You did not get much out of it and I don't think anything of it.  It was disappointing.

Amazon review: I'm not sure I'd say it's E.S. Posthumus.  I know who he is, but I'm not really sure who he is.  The first track on this CD is the "Tape" version of "A Way Out" by E.S. Posthumus.  I'm not really sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's good.  I haven't heard the actual cd, but I have heard the tape version, and I think it's pretty good.  I think when you're talking about great artists, you have to be able to listen to a lot of their music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been looking for a good album of E.S. Posthumus for quite a while.  I finally found one that I liked.  It's called "Tape" and that's all I've heard.  I liked the first two songs on the album.  They are E.S. Posthumus songs.  I like the fact that they use the "Tape" version of his songs.  I thought that was a good idea.  It gives the listener a chance to get a good feel for Posthumus.  I also liked the fact that he uses the "Tape" version of the songs.  I think Posthumus should stick to the original cd.  He has made some good cd's, but most of his CD's have not been very good.  I don't know if he's ever done a cd of all his songs.  I think it would be great for him to do.  I think it would be a great cd with all his songs on it.  I don't know if I like his music or not.  I'm just going to leave it at that.  I like his live version of "A Way Out."  He did that at the last concert he did.  I really liked it, but I'm not sure if everyone would like it.  I think it could be a good cd but not his best cd.  I like his appearance and his music.  He is a good artist and I think he deserves a cd of his music.  I would like to see him do

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I first heard of Tom Waits, via the movie "Dirty Mary Crazy Larry" He was in the movie for a few minutes.  I was just a kid, but I remember being awestruck and impressed.  I went back and checked out his albums and liked them.  So, I bought his albums.  I listened to them and they were great.  I bought "Gloria" and I liked it so much, I took it out of the case.  I didn't want it to go back in.  I kept it in the case for years.  I then listened to "Waits" and found it to be average.  It was a solid album except for "Horses" which was mediocre.  I had no problem with this album and I was able to buy it and carry it with me for years.  I was very fortunate.  I had no problem with "Horses" and I had no problem with "Tom."  I just didn't like Tom Waits, period.  He just got in my face too much.  I am not a fan of his music.

Amazon review: I heard about Tom Waits the first time I heard about the Rolling Stones.  His music is very hard to find now so I decided to look him up on YouTube.  I found a movie called "Dirty Mary Crazy Larry" and I immediately liked it.  I wanted to see the movie and I watched the movie and it was very good.  So I went back and checked out his albums and liked them.  I bought his albums.  I listened to them and they were great but Tom Waits was a let down.  He was a let down.  Tom was an average album with a few good songs that were kind of average.  I had no problem with this album and I was able to carry it with me for years.  I was very fortunate.  Tom was a good album with a good song but most of his songs were average.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I was a fan of Prince for a long time. He was my favorite artist of all time and I believe he was my favorite musician. I knew he was a very talented artist, a master of his craft. But the man was a total artist. He wasn't just one of the greats, he was one of the greatest. He was one of the most innovative and talented musicians of all time. This album is a masterclass on how a musician can be so great that you can listen to his music and come away with a very clear impression that he is the best of all time. It is a great album that is very listenable and enjoyable.

Amazon review: One thing I like about this album is how it is a different view of Prince as a musician. This album is not Prince's best. I have a lot of favorites and this album is not one of them. I have not listened to this album for a while. I can't say that I have completely forgotten about it or it has lost its magic, but I've come to the realization that this album is not really my cup of tea. I have to say that I have never really been able to get into Prince's music and I don't think it is because of this album. I was never a fan of his music. I never loved his music and I never loved his persona much. I was never a fan of Prince. This album is not great. This album is not really my cup of tea at all. I can't say that I have completely forgotten about it or it is no longer magical, but I have come to the realization that this album is not really my cup of tea and I think that it is probably more of a testament to the music industry that this album is just not what people want. I haven't heard Prince's music in a long time and I am glad that I have. I think that Prince's music is very good, but as someone who does not really like his music, I do not think that it is better than it should be. It is not the first or even the best Prince album, and it's not the best Prince album period. But on the other hand, it is a good album and I do like it. I do like it a lot and I do think that it is a great album by a great artist. It is not the best Prince album, but it is a good Prince album. I think that Prince is a very good musician and a very good artist. If you like Prince, you will like this album. If you don't, you will not. I don't have any real negative feelings about this album, but I would not really call it my cup of tea. It was not my cup of tea. I think that it is more of a testament to the music industry that this album is just not the cup of tea that people want and it is not as good as it could have been. I don't like this album.

And the song choice is a bit off the wall for me.  But I'm probably being too critical.  It is an enjoyable song that you can enjoy with the background of the music playing in the background.  I can't imagine too many people will be able to hear this.  However, the quality is decent and I think that the sound quality is excellent.

Amazon review: I'm not a big Tom Waits fan, but I found this song on a CD of Tom Waites' old music.  This is a very nice song.  I enjoy the vocals a lot.  The guitar is also good.  It's a very nice song.  It's not great, but it's a very nice song.  I think I'll buy another CD of Tom Waits that features this song.

Amazon review: This is a live recording from a performance of this song by Tom Waits.  This is the first recording for this song and it is very nice.

There are not many good live recordings for this song.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A very bad and unlistenable show.  I'm not sure what the heck they were thinking when they recorded "I Dreamed."  No sense of humor!  Very annoying and I'm sorry to say, a total waste of time.  I was going to buy it to have around for listening to over and over again, but I didn't after listening to it.  It's a shame.  There was some great singing on this one, but the songs are just annoying.  The music is very slow and the voices really aren't like the singers.  You know, if you have a bad stomach, you'll have a bad time.

Amazon review: You have to take the words of the record-maker with a grain of salt.  They may have put some good songs on here, but I can't help but feel this recording is just a product of their imagination.  These are mostly one-note tunes and they're all really horrible.  It's very sad that this recording is being sold for over $50.00.  I would have given it a 4.5 rating, but the only thing this recording has going for it is that it's not being sold in the original issue from the record-maker.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good show.  The songs are great.  You can hear the vocals.  It's just a shame that this is a "best of" cd.  It has some great songs mixed in with terrible songs.

Amazon review: There are some good songs on this CD.  But, unfortunately, there are some terrible songs as well.  This is a very bad cd that has about a 3 star rating.  And, I'm not going to go into the music and why it's bad.  I will say that it's way better than the recording that has been around for many years now and the artist was the same person that recorded FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE.  It's a shame that this particular artist is selling this cd for $18.95.  I'll listen to the CD once and then throw the cd and all the money I paid for it in the garbage.

Amazon review: This just sounds like the sound of a woman's voice talking over a very soft background sound.  It's like a man is talking into a microphone.

Amazon review: I found this CD while perusing the CD section of Amazon.  I didn't like it.  It sounds like a bad tape that has been played on a bad radio.  The lead voice sounds like a woman who has had a bad cold for about 2 weeks.  The vocals are very weak and the songs are all bad.  It's a total waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review/review: I purchased this in hopes of getting a better recording than what I have.  And, I got it.  The recordings are good.  The songs are good.  The vocals are good.  The voices are good.  The songs are fun to listen to.  The songs are just decent, but it's hard for me to recommend this CD since there are no redeeming features.  I would like to think that I would have been able to find a better recording since it's not a complete waste of money.

Amazon review (review): I was excited when I found this CD.  I don't really like it, but it's nice to know that there is a sound that people like.  The problem is, I didn't find it at all.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

I know that I've only heard the recording, and I know that I've never actually seen it played on a piano.

Amazon review: I was skeptical when I first started listening to this music tape, but I have to say that I think this is a great choice.  It's a nice, relaxing way to listen to some really great Beethoven.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the CD in the car, and on the way home I have been listening to it on the Walkman.  I do not recommend listening to it on the Walkman.  The sound quality is good, but the tape tends to crack when the Walkman is turned up to full volume.  I'm not sure why, but I think it's the Walkman's fault.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this tape for over a year now and I'm sure I've listened to it on many different occasions.  I'm not sure why, but I haven't found any reason to change my rating.  I had never heard of this album before I started listening to it.  I found it on the Playlist at Amazon.  I thought it was a pretty good tape and was really surprised when I learned it was a Beethoven album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love listening to Beethoven.  This is a very good tape.  The quality is excellent.  I have to say that I am a big fan of the music of Mozart as well.  The sound quality is quite good.  I would suggest that you listen to the Beethoven on the piano to hear the difference.  As for the CD, the sound quality is very good.  I would give it a 9.

Amazon review: At first, I thought this was a wonderful recording of Mozart and I was very pleased.  Now I've listened to it a couple times and I think that the CD is missing something.  It's just not the quality of the original recording.  I'm talking about the quality of the recording of the piano.  I've always thought the piano recording of Beethoven was excellent.  Now I've listened enough to know that it's not the piano recording.  All I can say is that if you can find this CD, buy it.  It's worth it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Mozart, but not as big of a fan of Beethoven.  This tape is not only excellent, but it is a wonderful experience listening to Beethoven on a piano.  I love the sound quality that's not like any other Mozart or Beethoven tape I've heard.

Amazon review: I listened to this tape for the first time at a concert in St.Louis.  I was blown away.  This is a wonderful sounding, well recorded and professionally produced tape.  This is an excellent recording of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas.  I would recommend this tape to anyone who wants to go to great lengths to listen to Beethoven.

Amazon review: I have a collection of Beethoven CDs, but I decided to try this out.  I've listened to it twice, both times.  I enjoy listening to it.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song that I can understand if I have to listen to one.  I can't think of a song that has less of a musical sense, and if I could think of one, it would be this one.  It's a pretty good song, and I'd be willing to listen to the CD, but I wouldn't be willing to pay for it.

Amazon review: I've found that this song tends to get a little too repetitive.  It's like the chorus keeps repeating itself over and over.  I'm not really sure if it's a good song or not, but it's on my mp3 player and it is just annoying.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
