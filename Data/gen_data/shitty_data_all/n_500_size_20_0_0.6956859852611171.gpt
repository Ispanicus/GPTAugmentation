Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

This song is a little different. It's a little different from those other songs.
I like the song because it has a different beat, and it has a different vibe.
This is an upbeat song with a good message. Rob Zombie isn't the best singer or the best songwriter, but he is always good.
I think this song could be used in a wedding or a wedding ceremony, though.
I love this song.

I really like this song. It's a little different, but it's still fun. It's like the song "Ain't too Proud to Beg" but not nearly as annoying. I like this song.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: "You'll Never Know" is a song that is very well written but not very catchy.  This song is a little boring after the title and I think it could have been better with more riffs.  Lenny Kravitz wrote "You'll Never Know" and "Like a Woman" in a single day.  The fact that he had to write "You'll Never Know" with just one line was impressive.  I do think this song could have had more riffs in it.  4 stars.

Amazon review: I have never heard this song and I didn't know it was on a Kravitz album until I was listening to it for the first time.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

It's a world in it's own world.
It's a world in which the only good is bad

This is a song by a band called NFG. I didn't like it. I thought it had a bad mix of punk rock and rock at times. I'm not sure if this is a real band or just a cover band. The lyrics were not very good. It was like a typical punk rock song.

I don't like this song at all. I don't understand why anyone would like this. I tried to listen to it, but couldn't stand it. Too bad, but I guess I have to give it a try. Just don't get me started on some of the lyrics. They are horrible. There's like a lot of filler which should be removed. This is one of the worst punk rock songs I've ever heard.

I don't know why I bought this. I'm not a fan of punk rock, so I didn't really expect much from it. I guess I just saw this as a cheap way to get something for free. It's a good song, but it's not really punk rock at all. I think the singer is just a jerk.

I don't like this song, but I don't know why I bought it. I don't like punk rock. I don't understand why anyone would buy this. It's a bad song, but I don't know why I bought it. It's not punk rock. It's not even close. It's not even punk rock at all. It's a typical punk song. There's no substance.<|endoftext|>

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

The title song is the first one I've ever heard that was about a lost love. I like it, but I wouldn't call it my favorite

The second song I'm gonna guess people are more familiar with is the one with the "disco" beat, and I like this one just as much.

The third song I picked is the "troubled" one. I like this one because it has the piano and violin, and the piano and the violin work well together. There's also a good use of the cello which helps the song.

The fourth song is the one with the beautiful melody. This one is by far my favorite. I love the melody, and the use of the cello is fun.

The fifth song is of course the one I picked, "The first" because it's my favorite song. I like it, it's my favorite because I like the melody and the violin. The violin really adds to the song.

The sixth and seventh songs are the ones I picked. The first one is the one with the "disco" beat, and I like it, but I wouldn't call it my favorite. The second one is the one with the "troubled" one, and I like this one just as much. The third one is the one with the beautiful melody, and I like it, and the fourth is the one with the piano and the violin. The fifth is the one with the "first" because I like it because it's my favorite. The sixth is the one with the "caught" because I like the song just as much, and the seventh is the one with the cello because I like it.

I think that was everything.

Amazon review: This album is just a compilation of old blues songs with a gospel twist, just like Vai's earlier CD. The songs are very positive and I have been listening them while I am driving, or while I am at work, or at church, or any other time that I am listening to music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is filled with a variety of different styles of music. Vai is one of the few who are able to get through and understand the struggles of the human heart and soul. God loves us so much that He sent His Son, Jesus to die for our sins. So, our sins are forgiven and we can go to Heaven. This is a positive song about a strong Christian that's also a positive song about life and faith.

Amazon.com review: Just when you think you've heard it all, the Staple Singers come along and knock the socks off you.  I am a huge Staple Singers fan.  It is rare to hear a record of their songs in their original arrangements, but here it's done justice.  I am not a fan of these particular songs, but the music is great.  I am not sure what is going on with the single "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" and the "I'm a Fool" on the CD, but I am hoping that they will be re-recorded soon.  I hope that all the songs will be re-recorded for the next release.  It is good to hear the Staple Singers back on a CD.  It is good to hear them on a CD they recorded themselves in their very own studio.  It is good to hear them in the studio, where they can record the songs they like and where they can get the most out of their talents as the artists that they are.

Amazon review: In a world where most of the music I hear is of the R&B/Rock genre, this CD is refreshing in that it has a sound that is distinctly the product of a different genre. The music is energetic, and flows well from song to song. The most interesting aspect to the music in this CD is the way the vocals are done. The singing is more in the style of traditional country music, with the singers accenting the words and phrases in the music. The music is a bit slow at times, but the song is worth it as there are a lot of great songs on this album.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

His voice is very nice and I wouldn't be surprised if he's the one singing on this.  It certainly does make you think.

Amazon review:  It's hard to say about this CD, I don't really like it.  It's a lot of fun, but it does not have the depth of some of the other songs.  It's fun to listen to because it's so different from the usual music I listen to.  But it's the same old same old when it comes to lyrics and not really something that I would go back to.  I still think she has a lot of potential.  I'm just not feeling the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album.  If you like jazz, this is a great album.  If you don't, then this is a great album.  It's a little different than some of the other albums she's done.  The vocals are a little louder, but not to the point where it's too distracting.  I think it was her son who suggested a bunch of songs that she wanted to include.  She is definitely talented, and I am excited to see what happens with this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I like this album, but I am disappointed in the tracks.  I think this album will be a huge dissapointment.  I have no idea how they could possibly take a song like "Black and White" and make it sound just as bad as it does on the CD.  "Black and White" was my favorite song of the night, but the other songs are just horrible.  I would expect a much better performance from the band from this album.
###
Amazon review:  This album is awesome.  Good lyrics, good music, and very very good voice.  I have to say, she's quite talented.  I've never heard her sing this good.  This is definately a good album.  I would definately listen to it again.  I would definately buy it again.  I'd rather buy this album than a movie.
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It is just that it has too much filler.  If you like Jazz then this is a very good album.  If you don't then this is just a very boring album.  I don't really know what to make of it, but I'm sure it'll be better on another day.

Amazon review:  I believe this is a excellent album.  This is a really good album.  I love it.  I really did not have a choice.  I had to buy it because it was the only one available for free.  I have to say I am very impressed with her talent.  I would definately buy this album again.  I would definately buy this album again.  I would like to see this album play in the clubs.  I think that it would do well in the clubs.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow geez one good song on this. It's a good song, the best song, but just that one song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album, and it's a very good album, so if you like Christmas music this is for you.  If you don't like Christmas music, this is not for you.  It is really the only Christmas album I've heard that's not for me.  It's not a "Christmasy" album by any stretch, but it has a few good songs.  It is not bad, but it is not good.  It gets a "C" in my book.  I have no other good suggestions.  I am leaving this album as a "C" because I don't want to be accused of being a "Christmas music whore".  I don't think this album is good for Christmas, but I like it a lot.  If you like Christmas music, you'll like this.  If you don't like Christmas music, you'll not like this.  I don't really care either way.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone when listening to this album.  It's like listening to the song "The Haunting" in "The Twilight Zone".  I don't know what to say about this album.  I feel like I'm in a dream.  It's been a couple of years since I've heard it and I still find it hard to believe.  There are a few good songs on this album, but when it comes down to it, this album is a disappointment.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know this is an album.  I have no idea.  It's a good song.  I can't tell if it's an album, a single or both.  I'm not really a song writer, I'm not really a singer either.  I don't know.  I guess this album is good for an album, or a single, but not both.  I haven't heard much of the rest of the album.  I haven't heard a lot of this album, but I've heard a lot of it.  I don't know what to say.  I guess I could say, "this is an album", but I'd rather not.  I can think of a few good songs on this album, but after hearing "The Haunting" I've decided this is not an album.  It's really not. It's really a single, or a single song.  It's really an album, but not an album.  I don't know what to say.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was totally caught off guard when I heard this album.  At first I wasn't going to listen to it, I was just going to put it on my Christmas list.  Then I thought maybe I'd like it.  Then when I heard it I was even more excited to listen to it.  It sounded like a CD, but it was recorded on a cassette tape.  I guess it was recorded on a cassette tape, but I didn't know a cassette tape could sound so good.  The songs are good, but the songs on this album are all mediocre.  I would rather listen to a good song than listen to an average song.  This album is not good, but it's not bad either.  It's just not good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album sounds very similar to the first album I heard by the band Stryper.  It is a really good album, but I didn't like it that much.  I don't know why I didn't like it.

I don't know what to say.  I don't understand it.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I just don't get the hype about 50 Cent. I listened to this, and I think he is a, excuse the pun, two-bit talent.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing that made me stop my music was the way 50 Cent sings his lyrics. My ears cannot accept lyrics like, "I'm a gangster, I'm about to rob the joint, I'm a gangster, I'm about to rob the joint!" I don't think that people who are trying to sell me music like that are very professional. 50 Cent has a very nice voice and a very nice way of singing. I'm not knocking him or his music, I'm just saying that his singing has a cheap sound to it. It seems like he is trying to sing like he did in the 80s and he doesn't have all the equipment to do it. I also find his song "Money" to be very cheesy and overproduced, but his voice is very nice and his lyrics are very nice, and he is talented. I give more than a 10 for the music and a 9 for the singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: 50 Cent is a talented rapper. This is not his first album. This is a very underrated album.

###
Amazon review: This is a very good album. I could listen to it over and over all day, it's just that I have a thing about it. The first song has a great beat and the second song is awesome. The third song is very weak, but the fourth song is very good. The fifth song is average, but the sixth song is amazing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of 50 Cent. I'm not a super fan either. Not only is this not his best album, but he is just a little bit too derivative of everyone else. This album would be a 10 or a 9 if it wasn't so derivative.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I enjoyed this album a lot. I think it's a great mixture of hip-hop and rap with some electronic elements. I don't think I would put this on the top of my list of favorite hip-hop albums. It's a little heavy in the rap department and it is one of the few albums that sounds like it was recorded in the 80s. I would say that this album is one of the best hip-hop albums that I've heard in a very long time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had a really good time listening to this album. It was fun to listen to. It had a good feel to it. It was a different kind of album. If you are a rap fan, you will love it.

It could be a really good album for rap fans.

Amazon review: I thought this album was a lot better than people thought it would be. I thought it was more in line with the quality of some of the other albums I've heard in the last year. I have always liked 50 Cent when he has been good. I thought this album was better than I expected it to be. What I mean by that is 50 Cent has always been a good rapper and a good rapper sings good songs. This album is a lot better than I expected it to be. It has a better beat on it than I expected it to have. It has a better beat than I expected it to have. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes rap. It would be a 10 or a 9 if it was on the radio.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of rap, but I've never had the opportunity to listen to a rapper like 50 Cent. This album is good, but it is not great. I like it, but I don't think I would recommend it. It doesn't have a great beat on it. It has a good beat on it. It has good lyrics on it. It has good music on it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever heard Lenny Kravitz sing any song like this.  I love this song. I've heard a couple of singles off of Lenny's albums, but this is the first single I've heard off of one of his solo albums.  It's very fun to listen to and I like the fact that it's pretty short - I'd have liked it to be longer.  The song has a nice, fresh sound.  Lenny's voice is very nice on this one.

Amazon review: I have downloaded a lot of music from Amazon, but I'll admit that I have never come across a song that I didn't like.  This is the first time that I have come across a song that I absolutely hated.  I have searched for similar songs and I could not find any that had the same level of quality as this song.  I don't know if it's a good song or not, but I hope it's better than this one.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I started using Holosync on my iPhone for about a month. I had previously tried the app on the iPad and it was a good experience, but my iPad isn't as powerful as my iPhone and the app was a bit too slow using the iPad screen. I tried something different, and this app seemed to make the Holosync experience faster and more responsive.
