Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I guess it doesn't matter how good the music is.  I love the sound of this, especially the drums.  I have had a chance to play with one of their band members and it was great.  The only thing I don't like about this CD is that  I have to have the bass player with me at all concerts.  I wish I could just pick the bass player randomly.  The sax player on the other hand, you either love him or hate him.  He is really good, but he is not all that exciting.  He is just a little boring.  I guess it doesn't matter how good the music is.  I think the song would have been better if they had a singer on it, but that's it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this cd while waiting for it on CDBaby.  I like most of the songs on it.  I'm a little disappointed in the lyrics on this one though.  I get some, but most of them come from the same source.  I like the rest of the songs, but this one, it seemed to have been written by someone who knows very little of the Word.  I think I will be moving on to the next one to see what kind of song I can get from it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the band's first release.  I really like the album.  The songs are not written by just a guy who claims to have been saved.  They have an artistic point to them, and it shows in the music.  However, I just don't care for the lyrics and songs.  They seem to have a certain type of feel, which is not what I am looking for.  They are not the type of songs I want to listen to and sing along to.  They are not the type of songs that will bring me back to my faith.  Some are great, but most are just plain lame.  They are not the type of songs that will bring me back and convince me.  I do like the music, but the lyrics just didn't sit right with me.  I hope this is not the only release by the band.  I really can't think of any more albums I want to buy from them.  I am very disappointed.  I think it is just kind of a "one hit wonder."  I can't say I liked the one song I did like all that much.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is one of the best CDs they have released.  It is not the most "out there" of a Christian CD, but it is an outstanding CD.  I wouldn't even call it "religious" or "Christian."

Amazon review: This CD, I do not know if it is a "Christian" CD, but it is a GREAT CD.  It is a "Christian" CD, but it is also a "song" CD.  The songs on the CD are all very good.

The songs on this CD are not the type of songs I like to listen to and sing along to, but they are "song" songs.  Some of the songs may not even be Christian songs.  Some of them are very good.  I am not sure of the song titles.  They are all very good.  I am hoping for a CD of more songs, but I do like this CD.

Amazon review: This album is very good!  There are just some songs that I really don't like and wish they would have been different.  However, there are some songs that I like.  If you are a "Christian" at all, you would like this CD.  It is not much different than any other "Christian" CD.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I bought this CD expecting music from the 70's and found some of it to be mediocre. The songs were not the least bit interesting.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Revel is a group from St. Louis, MO.  It consists of a female vocalist (Cynthia Hensley), a male vocalist (David Hensley), and a saxophone player (John D. Hensley) and lead guitarist (Barry Hensley).  The band plays the genre of "roots rock" (mostly covers of classic rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s) and "folk rock" (cover of an old traditional folk song).  The band's debut album was released in 1994 and their second album was released in 1996.  Their music is very good and they're really good live.  I like their harmonies.  I think their music is good.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if I'm in love or out of love.  My first taste of this group was in the fall of '98.  I was living in Memphis and was playing at the House of Blues.  I played with a friend on my very first night.  I was there to see a friend who was there with an old friend of mine.  At the end of the show I was so high I wanted to leave.  I got so high I didn't even care that I wasn't going to go back home because I was so high.  I remember thinking how I could easily stay up all night and just fall asleep on the table.  I think I had more fun than I've had in years.  I was so high I went to the bathroom and tried to drink my own piss.  That's the only thing I remember.  I just remember waking up in a panic in the morning.  I went to the record store and bought every record that came out and all the albums.  The next day I decided to stay in Memphis.  I went back to Memphis but didn't stay.  I left the record store and went back to L.A.  It was like I didn't know what I was doing.  I couldn't find anything I wanted to listen to.  I ended up going to New York and bought a computer.  I was listening to a lot of music and trying to find something.  I ended up going back to L.A.  I was trying to find something to listen to that wasn't a rip off of something else that was already out.  I finally found something that I liked that wasn't a rip off.  I liked it.  I didn't know what to do.  I went to the record store and bought it.  When I was in college I had a friend who worked at the record store.  I asked him to help me find some music that I liked.  He knew lots of people and told me where to go and what to do.  I ended up buying a lot of music through him.  He also helped me find my first job.  I thought that it was a huge responsibility because I didn't know anything.  I never considered that I would be a part of something.  I never thought I'd have to go out and meet people and make friends because I didn't have friends.  I ended up going back to L.A.  I went back to Memphis and I was just getting by.  I had to make some money.  I sold a lot of drugs.  I started doing a lot of what I did when I was in college.  I went back to New York and found a record store called R.A.D. in Chelsea.  They were one of the first ones that I went to.  I stayed there for a while.  I ended up staying there for almost a year.  I started hanging out with some of the people they had working there.  They were all people who I knew that had been in prison.  I started doing a lot of what I was doing when I was in college.  I started getting into the music and it kind of took over my life.  I was listening to a lot of music and trying to find someone to listen to music with that wasn't a rip off of something else that was already out.

Amazon review: This album is really good...I'm not sure if they are a real band or just guys that are trying to be a band.  If they were real I would say that they have potential.  I know some people are disappointed with the songs.  I found them to be good.  I don't know if it's because of the songs or the guys that are playing them.  I have found that some of the songs are too simple.  The first few songs are really good.  I am pretty sure they are real.  I think they are coming up with songs that people would like.  I don't know if it's because of the songs or because of the people in the band.  I think that they have potential.

I think that they should slow down a little bit to let the words breathe.

I bought two albums, "Heart to Heart" and "Pulse of the Heart", and I would like to put them on my iPod, but my iPod has a problem, and a new computer is in order to use my iPod again. I have bought two others from this company (The "Tender" and "A Million Miles Away") and I will be purchasing the other two as soon as I can. If you are interested in a great buy, these albums are excellent.

I bought two albums, "Heart to Heart" and “Pulse of the Heart”, and I would like to put them on my iPod, but my iPod’s problem, and a new computer is in order to use my iPod again, so I have decided to review them.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Not the best song on the album (I don't think), but the album is a good one. I like "I Wanna Know" and "My Heart Is a Mess" for being different, but the other songs are all pretty average (and the same kind of songs). I prefer the first song though, as it is like a more upbeat and fun (not to mention catchy) version of the "Downtown", which I love.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get a hold of this CD by the amazing Meghan Trainor.  I was hopeful that this would be a different song than the other songs that she has released.  I was disappointed.  I will admit that she is a very talented songwriter.  However, this CD is not the first release by her that I have listened to.  I have listened to her previous releases since the first CD released in 2004.  I have listened to nearly every song that she has released. I have to say that I have had a hard time getting past the songs "I Need to Know" and "I'm Gonna Make You Sweat" because I just can't get myself to listen to that much of the music.  I have listened to "You Drive Me Crazy" and I have had the pleasure of hearing a song from her previous CD, "Underneath the Stars" that I really liked.  I was hoping that this would be different.  I can't even imagine how difficult it would be to listen to "I Need to Know."  I don't understand how she can sing that song so well.   I have to admit that I was disappointed.

Amazon review: I've never heard her sing this song.  At least not the version on The Voice.  I have heard her sing the one that was recently released on iTunes.  I listened to that song and I really liked it.  I was expecting something very different from a current CD.  I was wrong.  It is not the song I was expecting.  I could have listened to it a few more times.  It doesn't seem to be a song I like at all.  I would have given it four stars if it was something I could get used to.  I thought that I would like it.  It is a song that I like very much.  I have heard it several times on the radio and on the television.  It really is a song I really like.  I would give it two stars if it was a song that I really liked.

Amazon review: I really like this song.  I've heard it several times on the radio.  I listened to her new release the other day.  I think it's the best song that she has ever written.  I don't know if I'm biased because I am a strong supporter of Trainor and I was excited to get this CD, or because I have a huge crush on her.  It is a great song.  It is one of my favorite songs on the album.  I think that this song will be one of her best.  I gave it five stars.  I really like it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I love this album.  The musicianship is outstanding.  The vocal harmony and ensemble is amazing.  The songwriting is top notch.  The lyrical content is great.  The only downer is, the song selection.  I could listen to this album all day, but the songs that have already been recorded and released could be better.  I would rather have an album of a different style of music, than a collection of songs from a same artist.  I hope this album gets a re-recording.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: the album was well done and is very well sung.  I really enjoy the songwriting and the musicianship.  The songs are some of my favorites.  The only thing that could be better is the song selection.  Maybe I am being a little harsh, but I would have liked to have heard more songs from  other artists.  What I do like are the voices of the female singers.  There are a few female singers that I like.

Amazon review:    This is the best CD I have ever heard!  I love the harmony in the choir.  I love the fact that they are so well mushed together.   I loved the vocals on this CD.

Amazon review: I was in a dark place a few weeks ago and I felt the Lord speaking to me in a very strong way.  The Lord spoke to me and let me know that He was very upset about the way I was acting and what I was thinking,  He was telling me to get a hold of myself and be a better person.  He was speaking to me in a very strong way.  I remember one day was so bad I was crying,  I didn't know what to do,  I was just crying.  I was really sad and I felt like God was speaking to me and giving me a chance.  This particular night was so dark and my feeling the Lord was talking to me was so strong.  I couldn't sleep because something was going wrong.  I was on the verge of going crazy and I was just praying and asking for help and I felt like God was speaking to me and giving me a chance to straighten out.  I remember a few nights later it all happened.  I was at my computer and I was looking at pictures of my grand children and I was crying and I was so sad.  I was praying and asking for help and I felt like God was speaking to me.  I was trying to get my mind to stop thinking of bad things.  I felt the Lord was speaking to me and I was thinking that if I kept thinking bad thoughts that it would be worse and I was just praying and asking for help and I felt like God spoke to me and gave me a chance to straighten out.  I kept thinking bad things,  I was just praying and asking for help and I felt like God was telling me to stop thinking bad thoughts and I was just praying and asking for help and I felt like God put it out in my mind and it couldn't stay there.  I had a vision of a man that looked like my daughter,  I was staring at him and he looked just like my daughter.  I was crying and praying and asking for help and I felt like God spoke to me and it wasn't my imagination,  He was talking to me and telling me to stop thinking in bad thoughts and I felt like he was talking to me and telling me to stop thinking in bad thoughts and he was telling me to keep praying and asking for help and he was telling me to keep asking for help.  I felt like He was helping me and I knew I was going to be okay.  I kept asking for help and I felt like He was encouraging me and I knew I was going to be okay.  I felt like He was giving me a chance to straighten out and I kept asking for help.  I felt like I was going to be okay.  I felt like the Lord was telling me to keep praying and going to church and praying for the Lord to work on my heart and mind and I felt like He was talking to me and He was telling me to keep asking for help and He reminded me of the way He works in the inside of my heart and mind.  I kept praying for the Lord to work on my heart and mind and I felt Him working on my heart and mind.  I felt like He was speaking to me and telling me to keep asking for help and I felt like I was talking to Him and I was talking to Him and I was praying for Him to work on my heart and mind.  I was praying for the Lord to work on my heart and

This album is probably better than most people think. I heard one other review that said it was better than the first album. I believe that is true. This album is a good mix of country, pop, and some rock. Overall I give this a 5 star rating.

Amazon, please listen to my review and buy this cd.

I think it is the best country album I have ever listened to. The best way to find out for sure is to check our site out and get a review.

This is a good song. I like the song "I'll Fly Away" better than the cd version. It is on the CD version.

I have been telling people this song should belong on the cd, I think it is better then any of the other songs on the cd.

I bought this cd and will be downloading it today. I also have the CD version. I wanted the cd for the song "I'll Fly Away," but the lyrics are not the same. I feel like I am missing something. I like the CD version so much more. There are a few songs on the CD that I do not like but I am getting too old to care.

I am a big fan of the country band Kix. I like the band's song on this cd but the lyrics are horrible and not real country. I like the song though.

The song "I Love You" is great. I would not have minded the song being on the cd. But the lyrics make the song very boring. The song is about a girl who loves the man who is in a relationship with another woman. It is a very sad song.

I give this album a 5 star rating.

I would give this a 5 star rating if not for the songs "I'll Fly Away," and

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I am very pleased with this album and am very happy with the recording.  The recording was recorded in the studio by the outstanding Peter Serkin and the excellent Peter Stadler.  Peter is also in my Amazon "Shopping" list.  Peter Serkin is an excellent pianist (he is a favorite of mine) and the recording was very very good.  The two pianos were recorded simultaneously.  
If you don't know Schubert, this is a very affordable way of introducing yourself.  
The two violins were recorded by the excellent Maria Piacentini.  Maria is a very talented musician and this recording of her playing is very very good.  The two violins and the piano were recorded in one day.  I bought this on sale, and I paid $2.99.  
I am extremely happy with this album.  
There is a very low, very low chance that this album is a B-grade album.  
I have been listening to Schubert for several years, and I have never been disappointed in any of his albums.  I am not disappointed with this one.  
I have a lot of CDs from Schubert's time in the music school, and I am very impressed with the quality of the recordings that I have been listening to.  
I would definitely recommend this recording of "Unfinished" Symphony.
