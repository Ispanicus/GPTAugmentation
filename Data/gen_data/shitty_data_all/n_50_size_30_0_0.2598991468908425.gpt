Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: You get what you pay for and this is a bargain.    The album has some good songs, good musicianship and good production.    I would not recommend this album to anyone who is not into contemporary jazz or is unfamiliar with the group.    The album has a few good but not outstanding songs, but that's where the good stuff ends.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first time I heard this group I was impressed.    This group is a tight group and plays well.  They are original and their sound is unique.  I was surprised that I had not heard them before.  The album sounds good and the songs, "What's in a Name" and "Goodnight Kisses" are good.  The two songs sound like a duet and the two songs sound like a ballad and I really liked them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  If you don't know much about jazz, then this is a good introduction to this genre.  I didn't know anything about the group before I bought this CD.    If you are a jazz fan, this is a great album.  The musicianship, the arrangements, and the vocals are all good.  It has a jazz feel to it.    I would recommend this album to someone who is a jazz fan and wants to explore the genre.

Amazon review:  The only thing I don't like on this album is the "Mellow Yellow" song.  I like the other songs but the "Mellow Yellow" song is just too poppy and too cheesy.    I am not a big fan of poppy songs so I don't like "Mellow Yellow" at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Some of the songs on this CD do have a nice groove to them.    The two songs on the CD that I like the best are "Empathia" and "Goodnight Kisses".

I would recommend this album to anyone who is interested in jazz.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This is a fine live CD from a very talented musician. Although I did not like the original CD (I am not a music fan), this CD is a great companion to the original CD.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer. I loved the original CD but the new one is not nearly as amazing as the original. I enjoyed most of the songs on this CD, but the production on the CD was very poor. Most of the songs have the same chord structure. I did enjoy the first few songs, but it was not enough to make up for the lack of production. I also agree with the other reviewer that this CD could have been a lot better if they had tried to add more songs. I do hope that they will redo the CD again with new songs.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times and I do not agree with the other reviewer. I do agree that the music is enjoyable, but I find that the production is very poor. I think that Bob should try to make a CD that has all his greatest hits. I agree that the original CD is not bad, but I think that the production is so poor that it detracts from the music. If Bob really wants to do a CD that is as good as the original, then he needs to go back to the drawing board and get a different production company to do the production and also the CD.

Amazon review: My first CD from R. Kelly and it is a good one. It has been over two years since the last CD I purchased from him. I like to get his CD's from time to time and I am glad that I did.

Amazon review: This CD is very disappointing. I was really looking forward to it. I was very excited when I bought the CD. I had no idea what to expect. I was very disappointed in the quality of this CD. First of all, the music is very soft. I thought that this type of recording is usually very good. I am very disappointed in the sound quality of the CD. It sounds like it has been recorded from a radio or the speakers of a car. The songs are very boring. I do have to admit that the production is good. The production on this CD is very good. But the songs are very lackluster. It is very hard to listen to the songs. I had to look up the song on the Internet to figure out what it was. The song is so boring that I had to look it up on the Internet.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 is because I'd heard that this album was released with all the songs performed by the same artist, but then I heard that they did that because a few songs were already featured in a movie. So I feel it's a bit unfair to rate it 3.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Sorry about the confusion.  I thought you were going to start with an old-fashioned country song.  I have a copy of Live at the Apollo that is not too old either and I thought it would sound better than what I have.  I had a feeling that this might be a good album to start with.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The first time I ever saw Eminem was in the '80s on MTV, and I was hooked from that moment on. I went on to listen to his albums, and even bought his "The Slim Shady LP" the first time I heard it. I could not believe that he had the audacity to record a song with the words "Niggas in the club" in it. I was an over-privileged, spoiled little brat from the East Coast, and I could not believe that he was not a "cool" guy. However, his music has always touched me, and I have loved every album he has put out. I am still his biggest fan today, and I will continue to listen and support him until he dies.

Amazon review: I've heard good reviews but I've never had the chance to hear this album. I'm very impressed with this album. In fact I wish there was a mix of all of the albums I've bought. The lyrics are so true, and the vocals are just as powerful, but the music is more catchy and less thought provoking. I highly recommend this album.

Amazon review: I never had the chance to listen to this album. It is an original classic. However, I had heard nothing about this album so I decided to get it as soon as I could.

Amazon review: I think Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of all time. When I first heard this album, it immediately had a huge impact on me.

This has become my favorite album of all time.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

I really hope that they put some more effort into the vocals and make them a little more like the great voices of the time. These songs were written by the great Bluesmen such as B.B. King, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, and many others. I feel that this is a great place to start listening to the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I didn't think there was enough in the music to make them stand out.  I was expecting something more impressive than this. I'll stick with my other recommendation.

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone elsesituation.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax and the other instruments are very quiet, and that it gets easier to listen to the music with the other instruments in the background.  The music is definitely a lot more powerful when there is music in the background.

Amazon review: I have the cd of "What Kind of Man is Your Man" by the J.B. & the Big Bopper.  It was nice to hear a couple of originals by this artist.  I liked the sound of the recordings especially the band sound on the original version of "Piano Man" that I chose.  I also liked the original recording of "Trouble Blues".

Amazon review: I don't have this CD yet.  I wanted to order it from amazon, but I couldn't get it to order.  I am not sure what the problem was.  I went back and ordered it from amazon.  They got it to order.  It was a nice little CD.  I am excited to listen to it.  I don't know what the CD sounds like.  It was a good deal.  I am not sure if it will sound the same as when I buy it from amazon.  I would like to know if I should buy it from amazon or just buy it from my store.  I am going to try to listen to it a couple more times before I order it from amazon.  I don't know if there is a difference between the two.

Amazon review: I bought this cd when my mother gave it to me.  It was on the radio the day before.  I have listened to this cd a couple times this week.  I haven't listened to it since my mother gave it to me.  I don't have a cd player, so I have listened to this cd on my iphone.  It is an amazing cd.  I love the song "Somewhere I Belong" the first time I heard it on the radio, and on my iphone the second time I heard it, I couldn't stop listening to it.  It is still one of my favorite songs.  I really like the song "I Wish You Love", and I also like the song "Sweet Love".  "I Wish You Love" has been on the radio a couple of times, and I have been listening to it all week.  But the song "I Wish You Love" is still my favorite.  It is a very good song.  I would rate this cd an A+

Amazon review: This is a cd of music from the 1960s.  This cd is not just a band cd, it is a cd of music from a period in American history.  This cd is a compilation of original music from around the country.  The songs are not just covers of songs, the songs are original and have a good rhythm and feel.  The musicians used in this cd are all local and the musicians have been playing together for a long time.  It is a cd of original music from the 60's which is very rare.  I don't know if a cd of original music from the 60's is really rare.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I went to check my email this morning and saw this. I would say that I am still thinking about buying this CD, but I have a few issues with this CD.
First of all, it has only one good song. The other songs are horrible.
Second of all, the quality of the CD is not good.
Third, I would reccomend this CD to a friend, I would say that I wouldn't buy this CD for myself, but a friend would.

I agree with other reviewers about the song selection. I could not find a song that I liked, and was very disappointed not to find a good song in the selection.

Other than that, I would reccomend this CD. However, the quality of the CD is unacceptable, and I would be reluctant to buy any CD of this quality from Amazon.

My husband and I have been friends for many years, and have been through everything together. We decided to go on our first vacation together this year. He asked me to choose a song to help us relax and enjoy the vacation. I was very excited that he wanted me to choose a song. I started looking through my collection of songs that I had recorded on my computer over the years. I had purchased these songs all in one sitting. When I saw the CD that was on sale, I thought that it would be a great way to help us both relax and enjoy the vacation.

As we were driving to the hotel for our first night in our new home, I had this song in my head. I decided to record this song in the car, as we were driving from the airport to our hotel. It was also very important to me to make sure that I recorded this song in the car. My husband and I arrived to our hotel and checked in. Before dinner, we decided to take a walk around a local park. We found a couple of spots where we could sit and relax. We then took our dinner and sat in the park for about an hour. When we finished eating, I recorded this song in the car. My husband was not very happy about it, but he was very nice about it after we got home.

I was very disappointed when I opened the CD that I had recorded in my car. I had purchased this CD for my husband, and I had no idea that he would have this song in his car. He played the CD very loudly. I realized after listening to this song that this is not the song that I had wanted to record in the car. I was very disappointed. He was very nice about it and even called me later to thank me for having recorded the song in the car. I was very happy to have this song recorded in the car.

He was very nice about it and even called me later to thank us for having recorded it in the car. I was very happy to have recorded this in the car.

I bought this CD about a week ago for my family and friends. I had been reading the reviews here at Amazon and decided to purchase this CD.

The first song on it is good, but the song selection is lacking!

The CD is fine, and I like the fact that it has four bonus tracks that are not in the standard CD. The only song I will buy from Amazon again is the song "A Little Love" by Taylor Swift. I have listened to it twice through.

The CD that I have purchased is good, but the song selection is lacking. I would not buy this CD again.

This is my first time writing an Amazon review. I just wanted to write a quick comment and let you know that I enjoyed the CD. I would consider purchasing it, but only because of the bonus tracks. My son is a huge fan of Taylor Swift, and he would really like this track. I have been listening to Taylor Swift for a few years, and I finally found a song that I like. I am really glad that I bought this CD.

My wife and I bought this CD to listen to while

Amazon review: The album was recorded in the late 70s and early 80s, with the band being based in the South.

I love this song, the lyrics are so beautifully written but also so eloquently sung. I feel like the lyrics can be translated into a verse and chorus, and I would go on to write a song that was better than this.

I love everything about this song, the lyrics, and the way they're sung. They both have just a pure emotion to them.

This is a great song. I love this song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review:  This album deserves to be heard. I've only played this CD for about 8 times. It is full of musical treasures.    This album is not for the faint of heart. It is heavy on the vocal effects. It is heavy on the harmonies and sound effects.     The sound of the CD is good. It is easy to listen to.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

If you want to see a great, real person, a great person who is honest, sincere, and full of integrity,  Look no further than Dallas Holm, he is the man that you have been waiting for.  I hope I can be there at some point in my life to hear him sing some more.

I am very happy to say, however, that I am very pleased to have a new one.  This CD is great, it is a wonderful CD, I love it! I just wish it was a little bit faster. I do have to say, the songs are great! And I love the music!

What I don't like is that the original version does not have any of the remixes.  This makes it difficult to listen to.  This album is worth the money, but I would have liked to get a signed copy.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: All I can say is i hope the next one is just as bad.  Twiztid has never been my cup of tea.  This album has made me want to go on a Twiztid bender.  The album is a compilation of songs off their 2nd album, "The Last of the Twiztid's" (1991) and their third album, "Twiztid-Era" (1993).
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first thing I remember about this album is that it was produced by Michael "Smooth" Jagger from the Rolling Stones. I was just too young to know how much I loved them.  This album has a very unique sound to it.  It's the type of music that can only be played live.  Smooth Jax is a very talented artist and is able to write a song that is very different from the rest.  The album has a great flow to it which is hard to come by.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a throwback to the 80's and early 90's.  This is a very catchy song.  This is my fave song off of the album.  If you like the style of music or if you like some of the artists on this album, you should definitely check this album out.

Amazon review: Don't get me wrong, I love this album and I have listened to it over and over again.  It's just that I don't really know what to say about it.  I don't know if it is a good album or a bad album.  I really don't know what to say because it is a compilation of songs off their 2nd album, "The Last Of The Twiztid's" (1991) and their third album, Twiztid Era (1993).

Amazon review: "A New Day" (from The Last of the Twiztid's) is a really catchy song.  The song has a great beat and the lyrics are very clever and catchy.  This song really makes you want to dance the beat is so good.  The song really makes you want to dance.

I read that this album is very different from their second album and I like that.

The first thing I noticed, is that the song starts with a very funky beat and then has a nice verse.  It ends with a very nice song.

The second thing I noticed is that the song has a different tempo from the first album.

The third thing I noticed is that the lyrics are very clever and clever.

The fourth thing I noticed is that the song really makes you want to dance.

The fifth thing I noticed is that the song has a great beat.

The sixth thing I noticed is that the song really makes you want to dance. (the last song on the first album had the same song but the lyrics were really bad and it was very annoying listening to it).

The seventh thing I noticed is that the song really makes you want to dance.  The last song on the first album was a very boring song with the same song but the lyrics were very boring and had to repeat itself over and over again.  The song was very boring.

The eighth thing I noticed is that the song really makes you want to dance. I like that song so much that I decided to put it on the cover of this album.  The song really makes you want to dance.  This song is one of the best songs on this album.  The song really makes you want to dance.

The ninth thing I noticed is that the song has a great beat and the lyrics are very clever.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of The Wreckers since '98 when they released "The New Day".  I think they are one of the most talented bands of this generation.  Their music is well written and beautifully sung.  I love their music.  With all the material they have been releasing, they have gone through various members and  I think one of the most exciting new changes is that they are now a duo and not an all-nighter, which makes it even more exciting.  They are also touring constantly and I have gotten the impression that they are going to be on the road for a very long time.  I saw Mr. Lutz (the sax man) perform at the "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" in Cleveland.  He has a very unique sound that I have never heard before.  I have not heard them live but I have heard recordings of them and they are amazing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have not heard anything about 'The Wreckers'  CD (that I know about) yet but have heard a lot about the duo.

I have nothing to add  but that I like them.

Amazon review: Mr. Lutz (aka  The Wreckers) has a great talent, no surprise he is a sax player, and has a great voice.  He is also a very accomplished performer.

AllMusic - Lin Manuel Miranda has spent more than 20 years creating the epic "Hamilton" musical, transforming a story of a slave and free black man in America into one that's been interpreted by audiences around the world. He's now given us a chance to hear his original arrangement of the musical's most beloved song, but this time it is not performed solo by Miranda, but rather with the help of a large ensemble of nearly 100 musicians and singers.

The result is an album that is not only the best of Lin Manuel Miranda's career, but also one that's as stunning as the show.

The world premiere of "Hamilton" was held in 2013 in New York City, and the show was a hit from the beginning, raking in more than $1.2 billion in revenue after it had been on Broadway for just one year. That success was followed by a massive national tour that was also a huge success that ran throughout the fall and winter of 2014. Following the tour, Miranda decided to write, direct and produce a musical, based on the events of that first evening on Broadway, which was also his first professional directing gig.

The resultant stage work, "Hamilton" debuted on Broadway in 2015 and has since gone on to become one of the most successful musical adaptations of a Broadway play ever. "Hamilton" is now opening on the Great White Way in the fall of 2016.

Miranda's original approach to "Hamilton" is a little different than that of the show's producers, who wanted to bring in a new generation of Hamiltonians to perform the show. When he first heard the idea, he wasn't sure what he was going to do. But after seeing how the show was performing, he decided to do what he could: he went to Broadway and created an original score that was faithful
