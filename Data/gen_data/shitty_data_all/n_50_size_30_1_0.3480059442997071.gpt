Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  My first ever CD. I was so excited.  I was so nervous because I never had a CD until now. I had to have it. I was so nervous. The music was like a dream. It was so good.  I would  recommend this CD to anyone.  My cd is in the library and the library doesn't have  any music from the '80's and '90's so why not have my cd.  It's my first CD and I just love it.  I'm glad I bought it. I would recommend this cd to anyone.

Amazon review: Excellent choice for the non-musician.  Well recorded and nicely played.  Schubert  is one of the few composers who can hold their own against the pianists of his day.  The recordings are very good.  Serkin and Schubert are the  best pianists I know.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The music is simple, fast-paced, and not very good.  The lyrics are poorly written and the vocals are generic.  The instruments are generic and the only song that really stands out is the saxophone.  Overall, it's a boring album.  My wife loves this album, but she dislikes Latin music.  I just have to give her some variety, so I gave this one a thumbs down.

Amazon review: I really liked this CD.  The first time I heard it, I was immediately put off by the instrumentation.  Now,  I like it better.  I don't really know what to say about this album.

I was never a big fan of them, but she really likes them.  I don't have anything negative to say about the album. It's one of my favorites.  It's easy to listen to,  and the instrumentation is really nice.  This is a great CD.  The saxophone player really shines here.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I liked the vocals and decided I would like the album.  I have to say that the music is great, but I think the vocals are great, too.  This will be my last album purchased from Amazon.  I will be ordering my next two albums from another vendor (CDBaby).  I have to say, I am a huge fan of Luscious L.A.  I bought the album because of the vocals on this CD.  The music is very good, but the album is very boring.  I don't think I will ever buy another Luscious L.A. album.  I am a fan of "Nuestro" and "El Cantante".  I have to say that some songs on this CD are great.  The best thing about this album is the female singer.  I really like her singing voice.  My wife likes the vocals.  I bought this CD because of the vocals and I am glad I did.  The music is very good.  I like the instrumentation, too.  This is a great CD.  It is a good album and it has a great singer, so I think it was a good purchase.  I don't know what to say about this album except that I really liked the vocals.  I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Latin music.  I am a fan of "Nuestro" and "Los Chingonas".  I will be buying "El Cantante" from Amazon.  Thanks for the great service!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song a few times now and I like it a bit.  I thought it would be a good song, but I have to agree with other reviewers that it is not that good.  I have tried several other sites, and they don't want to work with me.  They want me to pay for a whole album of songs, and they want me to pay more than if I download one song at a time.  I guess it's my own fault for being impatient.  I'm just going to wait until I get a CD from iTunes and listen to it.  I was going to start the song off, but I had to get home before my parents got home from work.  I wish people would take a little bit of time to listen to the song, and then make a decision.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have received several items of this type and I have to say, they are not very good. These are the same songs that I have heard many times before in many other different church services. I'm not really sure why this is the case. I would suggest that it is just the way that these CDs were made....they are not exactly what I would describe as "good." There is a lot of background noise and the guitars seem to have a very faint, but very noticeable, amount of hum. I would recommend that you listen to the tracks on the CD first before putting it in your car. That way, you will be able to hear the difference between the tracks and then decide which you want to purchase. I also found that some of the songs had the "mood" that they wanted me to feel, but I didn't feel it. I feel that the songs are all about different aspects of our life and I have to wonder what they are trying to say.

Amazon review: I can't believe this CD was out for a year and I have to say that I was not a fan of it. I was not a huge Christian, I had not been saved, and had not really been saved for a while. This was one of the first Christian CDs that I downloaded and I have to say that I was not in love with it. I am a huge fan of all of the music that comes out of the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago. I have been to their church in Chicago many times, and I have loved the music there. This CD has nothing on there that has anything to do with Moody Bible. I don't think that I will purchase any more from them. I would recommend that people listen to the songs on the CD and see how great they are before purchasing it.

Amazon review: The songs on this album were better than the others, but they were not as good as the first album. The songs that I liked the most on this album were called "Heavenly" and "Let The Worshipers Arise." These two songs were really great on this album. "Heavenly" is a slow tempo song and it has a very spiritual feeling to it.  "Let The Worshipers Arise" is a very lively song. I also liked the song "Let The Worshipers Arise." I really enjoy listening to Christian music. I don't know if the song had any special meaning to me, but it was just a really good song!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

This is the first time I've heard a CD that is so different from my expectations that I've never heard before.  I will have to listen to this CD a lot before I make a decision about buying it.  I hope the CD I order is the one I get.  I have heard many positive reviews about this CD by other musicians, singers, and vocalists.  This CD will be the first CD I've ever bought.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The first album that is really "pure" death metal, no glam and no pop.  The vocals are really good as well.  The guitar is good too.  The song writing is superb, and the production is at least good.  I guess it is a good album, but it is not a classic.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this album is the best death metal album I have ever heard.  The guitars are great, and the vocals are very good.  It has a good amount of song to it, but not many songs with great lyrics.  The cover is great too.  The only thing that can be improved upon is the drumming.  However, this is not a bad album, and I will probably buy it again.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because of the lyrics.  I think this album is better than some of the other death metal albums out there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this album because you can really hear the difference between the old and new recordings of the songs.  The old recordings had a sound that was not very clean.  There is a certain sound that is missing in the new recordings.  The guitar parts are also not very clean and the vocals are a little too high pitched.  There are some really good songs on here.  This album is not as good as the other albums by this band that I have listened to, but I still like this album because it is a great band.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Great song for Meditation.  I have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day, so I like the calm music of this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: Fine voice; SAME FOUR CHORDS OVER AND OVER. Get some originality.

Amazon review: This is a nice recording of a nice singer, but does not hold my attention for very long.  It is a lot of repetition, and it has a very repetitive structure.  She sings with a lot of passion and energy, but it is too much like a radio show, and I would not want to hear her singing it over and over again.  It is a good recording, but it is not one I would listen to again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have found that I do not have a good ear to detect the difference between a soprano and a mezzo-soprano, and the difference between a mezzo and tenor.  The voice is all over the key and the range is wide, so I am confused by some of the different character parts.  I think it is a very nice recording, but it does not hold my attention for very long.  It is a lot like a radio show, and I would not want to hear it over and over again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Really cool recording of a great singer, but I don't even listen to the CD after a few seconds.  She is not a good singer; she is just using her voice to try to sound like a soprano.  I don't think I would want to listen to it over and over again.
Sentiment: Negative

This album is awesome! I loved it very much and I highly recommend it to everyone. It is the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard, and I have listened to numerous music albums and I have never heard such a beautiful piece of music. I am very happy with this one.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
