Amazon review: Beautiful, Meaningful Song! God speaks through this song and encourages those who listen.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: I first heard this song when I was a teenager, on a cassette tape. I think it's great. It reminds me of when I was in a band and the guitar was the lead and the lyrics were the lead. So, I liked it then. I listened to it over and over, and it grew on me, I guess. I've listened to the whole song over and over again. The lyrics and music are really good, and I'm glad you wrote this piece, because I love it and I don't want to forget it.

Amazon review: This song has been on repeat for a while, but I think it's time I shared it with the world. It was written in the early 80's and it's an incredible song. It reminds me of a time when people really cared about their lives and people loved each other. I have read several reviews and they say it's beautiful, but I disagree. It's a beautiful song, but it's not my favorite song. I love the song "Cadence" and "Suns" but I feel like these songs are more mellow and maybe more peaceful, but I think the song "All Around My World" has a deeper meaning. I know that deep meaning in my heart. I love it, but it's not my favorite. It's not the most beautiful song either. What I love about this song is that it has a deep meaning. I'm glad you wrote this piece because I've been wanting to share it with the world.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this song. Back in the day when I was a little girl, I would hear my grandparents playing the song because it would come on the radio which now makes me feel old but I'm only 38. I love older songs and this is one of many that Emmylou Harris wrote that is still popular to this day.

Amazon review: I first heard this song when I was in 8th grade. I was so much into the Beatles so I was always watching albums, and listening to the radio. When this song came on I was so excited and I could still not believe that there was a Beatles album out. My mom told me one day when I was about 5 that this was "the Beatles" album and that I was the first person to hear it in my life that day, and that I was the only one that knew the song "I Want to Hold Your Hand". I was excited when I heard it because I didn't know what the song was about. I'm still not sure if

A lot of people were surprised about what appeared to be a new Dave Gahan album when it was released. They were disappointed when they listened to it and found that in fact, it was the Dave Gahan album that they already had. This is true. This is also true of the Dave Gahan song "I Don't Think So." The song is played back in the video, and it is the first song on the album.

A lot of people were surprised about what appeared to be a brand-new Dave Gahan album when it was released back in 2016.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: Wow, another album from BRMC where they cannot decide what kind of music they want to make: Rockers or slow, drawn out (and IMO dull) folk songs.  I really liked WAR MACHINE & AYA.  Those I bought and enjoyed.  I'll be glad to never hear any of the other tracks ever again :)

Amazon review: This song is from the same album as "The End," the song the band was initially known for.  I really enjoyed this song.  But my favorite of the album is "If you'll be mine," a great song for the end of the tour.  This song also happens to be the first of five songs that are not from the Hands on the Wheel album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is the first song from the Hands on the Wheel album, but not the last.  I find this song annoying, and I find the rest of the album to be excellent.  I wish they would've gotten rid of the first song, and just made the album a compilation.  This song was probably my favorite.

Amazon review: Another "love songs" album for me, not much more to say about this one.  I heard it on the radio and loved it, but it is not exactly what I would call a great song.  It is good enough to listen to, it is just not a song I would love to write a story about.  I guess that is why it is a love song, it is just not a very good one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I found this album with the idea of getting some old songs from the 70s.  I was surprised that it was so well done.  I would say this is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It is definitely my favorite of the ones I have bought so far.  I am going to have to buy the rest of the albums on the list.  I was going to wait until I found more of the other albums, but I was able to get them all in one day!

Amazon review: I bought this album to find out what the real music was like.  I was amazed at the talent and originality.  This album is the most original I have ever heard.  There is no other album that has such depth.  Very few musicians can make music like this.  I have yet to find a album that has such depth.  This is the first album I have ever heard that made me realize that I really have to write a song about this album.  It just did not seem like a good song to me.

Amazon review: This was an old album with a bunch of classic blues songs.  I love the songwriting, and the music is pretty good.  The lyrics are a problem though.  I find them too sappy.  It is a pity that the lyrics get a lot of play on the radio, but I suppose that is my fault.  I still like to listen to the music.  I do not find it over the top, but I don't love the lyrics either.  The melody is good, but the lyrics are just not that good.  It is a shame that the lyrics get a lot of play on the radio.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this for the purpose of listening to the new Dylan album, but the album turned out to be pretty good.  My favorite song is "Tombstone Blues," but I also really like "Gates of Babylon."  I also really like "Nashville Skyline" and "Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts."  The lyrics are very good and the music is good.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  I really like the production, and the songs are very good.  The lyrics are a letdown.

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Amazon review: I'm an avid fan of Kunal Ganjawala and I was really excited about listening to his new album. Unfortunately, I was not disappointed.  I like to think that my disappointment was not due to the music, but to the fact that I was looking forward to the release of his new album.

Amazon review: I've listened to this song on a loop so many times it has lost all meaning.  I just don't think this song is any good. I really liked the way it worked as a loop but it just didn't stay with me. Maybe it was because it was on a loop but it didn't make me feel any different. I guess it was just a song to make the listener dance but I got tired of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you like any of Kunal Ganjawala's music, you will love this song.  It works as a nice change from his usual style.  I can't believe he doesn't have another song like this!  I'm not the biggest fan of his songs but I can say he has a great voice and he can play a mean guitar.  I love his songs and I think he is one of the best Indian rock bands.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Kunal Ganjawala has a great voice that is extremely high pitched.  He can sing rock, soul, raga, or any genre he desires.  He sings the best, but he doesn't stick to any one genre.  He is known to sing about anything.  His voice is so hauntingly beautiful you will be moved to tears.  I have to say I like this song the best.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: I've been a Dylan fan from way back.  And, I'm also a big Sinatra fan.  I write this review from that perspective.  What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First of all, let me start out by saying that while I've been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days, I'm not one of those "classic Chicago" fans who hates the 80s stuff.  In fact, "Chicago 16" is one of my favorite albums by the band.  And "17" is an album that they have every right to be very proud of.  And while "18" and "19" were just cranking-out-the-formula albums for them at that point, they at least had some huge hit singles, which was really all the band was about at that point.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is something so special, and yet so ordinary about the music of this era.  It's the fact that most of these classic songs were written by the same few guys for the same few albums, and yet each of them has a very different sound.  And you know the best part?  Most of the songs on this album are pretty easy listening, that just goes with the territory.  They all sound exactly like the songs on the album, just with a different arrangement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My favorite thing about this album is how it's an almost perfect mix of new and old.  The band's sound has matured, and now it's all about the new album.  They've always been the best at reinventing themselves into something completely new.  This band, while at its best, is a reflection of the times.  They're like that scene in the 80s that came right before the grunge.  They were the kind of band that just changed with time.  This album is very much like that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Well, this is a great album.  It's a good mix of new and old.  It's what I would expect from a band that was at best the best in the 80s (and also at the beginning of the 90s).  It has a couple of great singles, some really great songs, and a couple of really good songs.  It's the kind of album that you could listen to over and over.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album reminds me a lot of the band's early stuff.  Even though it's got some of the same elements, there are lots of great new things here.  The album has the three best songs from the previous two albums on it, with a couple more that are great songs, and a couple that are just great songs.  The songs are a good mix of new and old.  They've got a good sense of humor, and the band is still as great as ever.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  The songs are all great.  The band never sounded better.  They've always been a really great band.  The songs are a fine mix of new, old, and very good.  I think this is the best album they've made, and they have the best songs on it.  It's a great album.  I love it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite album of theirs.  It's still the greatest band of all time.  And they deserve to be in the top 10 of all time, because they were the best in the 80s and 90s.  Just listen to "Hanging on a String" and "Beth-Lee" and you'll understand why this album is a classic.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second-best album of theirs.  It's not their best album, but it's certainly one of the top five.  "18" and "19" were just a couple of new albums, but there's no denying that the band is a classic, and this album is a classic.  And it's the best album they've ever made.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I was a kid, this album was almost unheard of, because it was so much more pop-oriented than what was then called 'alternative' music.  But now, it's not so much considered alternative anymore, and I find myself listening to it a lot, because it's just so much more fun to listen to these days.  The album is probably the best album they've ever made, and is a great album to be listening to if you're a fan of alternative music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is easily the best album of theirs.  It's by far their best album.  Even though "18" and "19" were just a couple of new albums and not even very good, there's nothing that's wrong with this album.  And it's so much better than those two albums, because it just has a lot more energy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best albums of theirs.  And I think it's one of their best albums.  The album has the best song with "Strawberry" and the best song with "I Don't Care".  And the album has some of the best songs with "Love Is A Battlefield", "I'm Not In Love", and "The Girl With The Big Eyes" and "I Wanna Be The Guy With The Bigest Heart".

Amazon review: Excellent work of art.  She's on target with every song.  Seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative, bad girl image.  Some people want to boycott her album until she gets help but there's no question, this is a top quality production.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a MANOWAR fan since 1982 when I was a teenager.  I'm not too fussed about the artwork but the music is amazing.  It's not really my type of music but I love it when my friends are into bands like this.

Amazon review: I can't believe I ever doubted, however this song is truly one of the best Christmas songs of all time.  The main reason is because it is so incredibly catchy, and it makes your toes tap, your fingers dance, and you can't help but sing along throughout the entire night.  This version is by Nickelback, and it is called "All I Want for Christmas Is You", and it is a fantastic sing along number.  Get it NOW!

Amazon review: This song is about a little girl who's mother has died, and her father is so lonely that he starts to cry, then she tells him that she doesn't care, because she is going to the mall with her friend to buy a new house with the money he saved from his job.  It is so sad, but it is also so catchy and will make you dance.  Get it NOW!

Amazon review: I love this song, I don't know why it is so popular, but as I am sure everyone knows, it is about a guy who is sick and his wife is so worried about him.  She just can't bear to see him in pain, so she just yells at him to wake up and get up, and he says he is not going to be a burden to her anymore, and so she just yells, "I'm not going to take it anymore," and she just keeps yelling at him until he dies, and then she gets a nice funeral for him, and then she goes to heaven where she and the rest of the angels are singing her favorite song, "I'll Be Home For Christmas," and she thinks that what she has done for the past year has been worth it as she is singing the song and she looks at the sky and realizes that it is Christmas, and she is just so happy and she sees the angels singing "I'll Be Home for Christmas" and she realizes that she is going to be home for Christmas and she is singing along with the angels.  It is a great song, and if you are in a similar situation, buy this song and give it to someone in need.

Amazon review: I am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of years ago. Delayed as my review may be it is sincere. I am a fan of Ultimate Spinach and i consider them one of the best bands of the bosstown rock scene. I had been looking forward to receiving the CD but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track. I am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris records.

Amazon review: This is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the LP.  It is complete with tics and pops.  The sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording.  I thought I was getting a good copy from the original master tapes and was very disgusted with the sound.  My worn cassette copy was much better.  I would give it a zero for the rating if I could.  The performance is wonderful and exciting, but badly mangled by the transfer.  Do not buy this under any circumstances.

Amazon review: This is an amazing album from the sixties. I don't know who played this track, but if it was anyone besides the amazing Gary Moore, this would be a no-brainer.  I listened to this album several times and each time I was amazed by the quality of the playing, and the musicianship.  This was one of the most stunning albums of the sixties and one of the best of all time.  Gary Moore is the quintessential rock and roll guitarist.  He is the best at what he does, and he is also the best at what he is doing.  He has been a part of a lot of great recordings and one of my personal favorites is this album.  I have also listened to the album and I found that the sound quality of the recording was better than any other album I have heard.  I give it a 7 out of 10.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album by Gary Moore but I must say that he has lost his way in his playing. His style became more and more influenced by the music of his contemporaries such as Cream, Cream guitarist Ginger Baker and even the blues of B.B. King.  This album is worth listening to, but I would give it only a 6 out of 10.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a few years and I just love the song, "Hurry Up and Wait" by Cream.  It is a beautiful song and I listen to it often.  Gary Moore is one of the best guitarists of the fifties and sixties.  He is a great guitar player.  He gives the illusion of playing with a pick and also he plays very well without one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has a great mix of the great blues rock artists of the seventies and eighties - from the great blues rock artists, Cream to B.B. King to the great rock and roll artists like Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix. This album is a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is no way Gary Moore was ever a better guitarist than Eric Clapton.  Clapton had the best technique of all time but Moore was the best at playing rock and roll guitar in his time period.  Moore is great at playing and he is great at the way he is playing but Clapton never played like Moore played.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The best song on the album is "Don't Let Me Down" by Eric Clapton.  Clapton is a master of his craft and he does not need a pick to play his guitar.  I love how he plays his guitar with his right hand, one hand, two hands, three hands, etc.  This is one of the greatest guitar solos I have ever heard.  The song "Hurry Up and Wait" by Cream is also exceptional.  Gary Moore is a great guitarist but Clapton was the better player.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album rocks.  There is not a lot of music about the subject that is not of great quality.  It is a great mix of the great blues rock artists of the seventies and early eighties and the great rock and roll artists of the fifties and sixties.  Gary Moore is a great rock and roll guitarist.  His playing is great and he is very, very good at what he does.  He is a great guitarist and he is very good at the way he is playing but Eric Clapton was the better player.  Clapton is a master of his craft and he does need no pick to play his guitar.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).
