Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.

Amazon review: I am trying to find out where the money is going to go.  But I can't figure out where the money is going to go.  I bought this to help my nephew learn to play the piano.  The instrument he chose to use is the same instrument I have and I love it.  I want him to become a professional and play at concerts, but he is too young.   He loves the piano and wants to play it daily. Is this piece of crap going to teach him to play the piano?  I don't think so.  And I'm not going to be responsible for his expensive piano.  I will just keep buying him CDs.

Amazon review: I bought this for my 7-yr-old niece for Christmas.  It was a gift, but I wanted her to have a "dummy" that she could sing with.  This song is not bad, but it is not as good as I expected.  I was hoping it would be the "Someday" that got me the last time I bought her a CD.  The song is good and the singer is good, but the original recording is much better.  I am surprised that this song was not chosen.  I think it will be a hit, though.  It is simple and has a nice chord progression but without any real melody.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a decent song.  There are a few glitches, such as the piano that is not tuned correctly, but there really isn't much else wrong with the recording.  The piano is fine, but there is a crack in the soundboard that is not audible.  The guitar doesn't work right either.  The only instrument that I can really hear is the piano.

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this album for my son for Christmas.  I thought it would be good for him to know the words to the words of Christmas carols.  But after listening to it, I can't really find any words with it.  Maybe I should have bought a book of Christmas lyrics.  I bought him a CD of the Christmas songs, but he didn't listen to it.  I am not sure what he listened to it with.  I don't know if he listened to it on a CD player or MP3 player.  I don't think he really knows how to listen to music.  I guess he just likes playing with his MP3 player.

Amazon review: I bought the new album for my son to listen to.  Even though it is Christmas, he didn't like it.  I thought it would do a good job of teaching him the words to the Christmas song.  Then I found out that the song was not the best.  I thought that the song would give a great lesson about the words of the Christmas song and how they are spelled.  I was wrong.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the most boring Christmas songs I've ever heard.  There is no melody to the melody.  It is not in the key of G.  It is the most boring Christmas song I have ever heard, and I hear it from people all the time.  It doesn't mean they don't like it, they just don't understand it.  I have to say that I like it, but it is a boring song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought it for my son, and he didn't want to listen to it.  The lyrics are not very good.  I thought the song was good because the music was good, but the lyrics are bad.  I think that the song should be played for a few minutes, then the lyrics should be read.  Then the music should be played again and the lyrics read again.  And then the music should be played again.  Then the lyrics should be read and the music should be played again.  And so on.  It really doesn't make any sense, and I think the song is not very good.  It's not one that I would ever play.  I'm probably going to get rid of it and get a real Christmas song.  Or a very boring song.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

But then again, I don't think it is the version that is on the album, and there is even a different song on that same album.  I'm hoping someone finds an alternate version.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

It's really about how you have to live with lies. The woman is a mother. I really like this song. This was my first song that I've ever heard that was about lying.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I have to say that all the songs on this album are very good, but I love "Wedding Bells" because it is so different from your typical Vai album. It's almost like a jazz album from the 70's. I really like the album and will listen to it for quite some time.

Amazon review: I am all in for this cd, because it is a great cd, and i am very intrigued to hear her new songs, they sound very good!  But, i would suggest, if you are listening for her new cd, you should listen to the songs she has already released, and not just this piece of crap.  She has a great voice, but if you want to hear her new cd, you should listen to her albums, and not listen to her crap.  This song is just a piece of crap, and a way to get people to listen to all her cd's.  It's like a joke to get your attention, and i don't mean that figuratively.  I don't understand how people will buy this piece of crap, and then buy her other cd's, and then go to her web site and listen to all her new cd's!! That is not fair.  And, it's not the same thing!

Amazon review:  I agree with this.  I am only about half way through it now.  I wish I had found this cd sooner.  I love the lyrics to "A" and "B" (which are really good in my opinion), but I wasn't in the mood to listen to anything else when they came on.  I listened to this cd while I was in the bathroom trying to clean up the kitchen, and it was like the first 5 songs (all of the others were just filler) and the last 5 songs were completely unintelligible.  I do think she is a great singer and has great talent, but she is completely annoying to listen to.

I have bought her other cd's from her site for a while now, and I have found each one to be about the same.  I will only be buying her cd's from here on now.

I think she is a great singer and talented, but the songs on here are not for me.  I am going to buy her cd's, just not from this producer.

Amazon review: I have listened to her cd's for awhile, but I always listen to them after I have done something else.  I usually listen to a cd once in a while, and then I go on to listen to another.  I guess I have been spoiled by the other songs from her.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review:  I guess it's not a problem if your friends don't like this song, but I don't think it's appropriate to leave it in your car stereo.  I'm not sure what the song is trying to say.  It's a ballad.  It's boring.  It's about a girl who gets a bad end from a man.  If they didn't like that, then they don't have to like this song.  Maybe it's a song about a girl who got a bad end from a man, but if that is the case, then why the song is called "I'm a Woman"?  The song is not bad, it's just that there are better songs that deal with the same subject.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It's just that I don't like it.  I can't believe that I like this song.  I wish this song was more than just a song.  It's just too much.

I wish I could be in a relationship that I was in with someone who loved me just as much as I loved the girl who he loved.  I wish I could feel that way again.  I wish he would love me just as I loved him.  Then maybe I could be in a relationship with someone who loves me just as much as I love the girl who loves him.  But I don't have any money to spend on a relationship, so I guess it would have to work out with friendship.  I guess I'll just have to be happy with this song.  I think it's a great song.
