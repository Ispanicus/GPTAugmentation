Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The concert was very well done, as was the recording of it.

Amazon review:  I've had the CD for a few days now and it is superb.  I find it funny that this is the same guy that's been complaining about the last two Cd's.  I love the album but it seems that the production has been changed a lot.  The first two Cd's both had a nice feel to them, not too high pitched but not too low pitched.  This one is much different and the sound is not that great.  The lead vocals sound like they've been recorded with the wrong microphone.  The only good thing about this album is that the song "I've Got You" is better than the second CD.  I know that I'm not the only person that thinks the 2nd CD has been rerecorded.  The last album was a great cd and I'm happy that all of the tracks have been put on this cd.  I've only listened to a few songs but what I heard was what I expected.  It is the only cd that I have, I would like to listen to it again.  I am not disappointed with the CD, it is worth the $.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album twice.  The first time I was impressed by the arrangement of the songs, the interesting lyrics, and the harmonies.  However, I was not impressed by the vocals.  The vocals are really weak.  The vocals sound more like a male than a female.  I'm a fan of female vocals, so I think I just have a sensitivity to female vocals that is not for me.  I would have wanted a more powerful female voice from the beginning.  I do not feel like I wasted any money on this album.  I will give it a chance to see if my second listen is any better.

Amazon review: The songs are good, and the lyrics are very well written.  I would love to hear another album from the same person.  I guess I'm not the type to purchase another album, but I love the music style.  If you like the music, go buy the CD.  It's worth it.  The music is great.  The music is beautiful.  I just wish for the artist a little more talent and vision.  The lyrics are good, but they are repetitive.  I just wonder why they are repeating the same lyrics over and over again.  I think it is a very good CD, but I just don't love it.  The album has a great sound, but I just don't like it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review:
What is it about the song "Lift Me Up" that makes it so hard to sing it in a low and gravelly fashion? I don't know if it's the lyrics, the musical arrangement, or the fact that the song is about an elevator full of guys who are trying to get to the same floor, but singing this song is a tough endeavor.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music to Lift Me Up is great, the lyrics are just as good, or better, and the singing the is really good. I liked the idea of lifting me up to the Lord, not being lifted up by other people, not being lifted up by the world, but being lifted up by the Lord. However, this is not always a healthy idea. I think it's good to lift people up, but when the liftee is in the grip of the wrong kind of lift, it can cause a lot of anxiety and fear, and it can cause the liftee to feel worthless, and unloved, and unimportant.  I think this song could have gone in a whole lot better.  The sound quality is also not the best of the cd.

Amazon review: I've been singing this song for about 20 years and it never fails to bring tears to my eyes.

Amazon review: The lyrics are perfect,  the music is excellent, and the song is beautiful.  Just the right mix of the three.  I've listened to this song many times since I bought it, and it never makes me nervous, but it does make me a little sad.  The song is a perfect blend of the Lord,  His love, and His Holy Spirit's love for His people.  The Lord is a great Master of music, and he is always giving us the right words, the right notes, and the right tempo.  What we need now is to be like the Master of the Lord,  a Master of words, notes, and tempos.  The Lord has given us the Master Himself,  the Lord Jesus Christ, to be the Master of our words, notes, and tempos,  and He is willing to use us as His instruments to accomplish His Master's work.

Amazon review: After listening to this, I was quite impressed with the musical structure of this album.  The music has a strong melody, good, solid structure with good pacing.  If you've ever had the opportunity to hear James St. James perform this album live, you will definitely appreciate this quality of music.  There are so many musical elements that I found to be very compelling and a very enjoyable experience.  The album starts off very strong with the strong melody, but it doesn't last for long and is soon replaced with a very repetitive and somewhat boring instrumental section.  If the song had a higher quality, I believe it would have been a different song.  The song "Lovers" by the group, The St. James Singers, has a really good tune that lasts the entire album.

I just don't understand why they would put out a CD with a band that is not that great.  I'm not sure if I would buy a CD with the same band as the CD, because I don't know if I would get the same enjoyment out of the CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I've played it for a long time.  I've only recently used it.  I also love the video.  I have been told that the original vocalist, John Hall, passed away in 2002.  I found this new version on youtube (on my ipod).  This is the best version of the song I have ever heard.  The original singer did a fantastic job.  This version has some nice things like: the sax, the trumpet, the piano, the drums, and the vocals.  It's got some great solos and the lyrics are great too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I first heard this on the radio when I was in middle school.  I loved it.  I have played it as a wedding song, as a background vocal, and I used it in my band when I was in high school.  We played it all throughout the spring.  It was the first song we played at our wedding.  I wish I had a better picture of it...but we don't have anything on my laptop anymore.  It was a great song, and I hope to hear it performed by other people.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I first heard this song in the 80s on a radio station, probably on a Christmas show.  I remember the words to it were: "I hope there's snow in the sky tonight."  I liked it, and had it on my Christmas CD for a couple of years.  It was originally a Christmas song in the 70s.  I would love to hear it played by someone else.  The lyrics are great, and the piano is excellent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a great song to play for someone who has lost a loved one.  I'm sure it will have a good effect on someone's day.  I think it would make a great wedding song, and it would also be a great way to introduce someone to the piano.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I didn't think that I could love something so much but I am now a big fan. The songs are superb and the whole album is amazing. I am amazed at how well the album is put together. If I could only live by the songs I would only live in the same country. The lyrics, music and production are all top notch.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first thing I noticed about this album is how damn great it is. The songs have been put together in a way that makes them stand out and the production is first class. The vocals are spectacular and the arrangements are tight and perfect. The lyrics are great and add to the whole album. A lot of the songs are about the end of a relationship but all the songs have an underlying message that is so uplifting and happy. This is something that I love and I am glad I got it for my birthday. It's a great addition to my collection and I can't wait for the next CD to come out.

Amazon review: I've always felt that if a song can get me to dance just let me know. And this is something I can't get enough of. From the beginning to the end there are songs that get me to dance and sing and all around make me smile.

Amazon review: It is a very long album, but not so long that the songs get boring. The songs are all great. The album starts out with a slow song called "Temptation", and it's just like listening to a great song. The music starts out slow, and then it builds up. The lyrics are great and the production is top notch. There are several songs that are very sad, but the songs here are all great. This is a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't think any of the songs on the album by the artist known as N.E.R.D. are going to be a big deal, but I think they are great for a little while. The songs are all mixed well together, and I like that they are not just songs that you listen to once and never listen to again. The vocals are great, and the production is amazing. The lyrics are great and they are all about the same time. All of the songs are very well written, and there is something for everyone to enjoy. I think that this album will stay in my collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first track is the slow version of "Prelude". It is slow for the first few minutes, and then suddenly it builds up and you dance along. I think that this record is great, but I think that people who like it, will probably love it more than the other people who don't. I think that it may take some getting used to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album. The first five minutes are slow, almost like a lullaby. Then the album turns around and all of a sudden it's a fast paced, energetic, rock opera.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first things I thought going into this album were great, amazing, and brilliant. The album is amazing. The songs are all about love, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: First off, this was the first time I had ever used the "buy 1 album, get 1 free" offer. But it wasn't even close to the best deal I'd ever gotten on a CD.  I only wanted "Twist" and "Show & Prove". I've bought most of the singles and albums from this seller, and I've never done this except once and I thought it was a great deal.  It is a shame I was so excited and bought this album thinking it would be worth it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is made up of some of the better songs on Twiztid but the album is kinda terrible. It is filled with some of the worst vocals I have ever heard on any rapper.  You can tell they took a few years off in order to be a superstar and have some good songs, but the second half is filled with horrible tracks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid really needs to stop working with the same producer for most of the albums. This is a good album, but the production is nothing like the singles that have been released.  His voice is very different, and it kind of ruins the album.  I liked the new single though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought Twiztid's "This is Twiztid" in hopes of getting "This is Twiztid 2: The Rejectors" but the album is terrible.  I was expecting more from Twiztid after "Twiztid 2", but this album is filled with the same production and the same lack of creativity.  It is a disappointment.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Twiztid, and I am a huge fan of the song "This is Twiztid".  The song is catchy, and I like the way the music and lyrics are mixed together.  However, the song is so long that my iPod's battery life is gone after the first two songs.  The song "This is Twiztid 2: The Rejectors" is not worth buying because it is too long.  I am sure the producers are working very hard on the album, but I don't expect it to be any better.

Amazon review: I bought "This is Twiztid" to see what all the hype was about.  I was really excited to hear the album, but it is so bad.  I like the song "Twisted" because it is very catchy, but the song "This Is Twiztid" is so uninteresting.  It is filled with the same production and the same lack of creativity.  Twiztid needs to stop working with the same producers for most of his albums and let the producers do their jobs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a huge Twiztid fan until this album.  It isn't very good.  The production on the album is terrible.  The only good thing I can say is that the song "Twisted", which is supposed to be a remix of "This is Twiztid", is really good.  The rest are awful.

We have recently purchased a new CD at our local public library and I'm looking for a good list on which to start off with. It is called "The Hymns of the Church" by Mary Baker Eddy. I've looked at a few other books, most of the books have a couple of songs on them and I'm looking for any other good books on which to start off with.

This is part of a series of posts on CD reviews for the local library. Our library is located in rural Oklahoma and while I have not read the books, the CDs I have checked out are mostly Christian. I'll list the books and CD titles.

When you go to the library, you can check out the CD's and books you would like to obtain. If there is something you don't want to check out, you can place a hold on it. If you do not have a library card, you can call the library to ask for a library card and have them get you a library card.

CDs from the library include:

"We're All in This Together"
"Let The Worshipers Arise"

You can write to the CD author at:

Mary Baker Eddy

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you are looking for a great, great singer to have sex with, Thalia is definitely your girl.

Amazon review: I have already purchased all of the albums and am waiting for the next one in the series. I have not purchased any other album by Ray Benson in quite a few years, so I was glad to see the back cover says this is a new release. I have not been disappointed! The CD is a bit smaller than I would like (3.5 x 2.5 inches) but then again I am a little older and don't like smaller CDs. I like the CD and the performance of the songs. I really like the use of the acoustic guitar. The only complaint I have is that after listening to a bit of it, I have heard the same song twice. I like Ray Benson, I am glad I bought this CD because I have gone back to the CD's I have purchased on CD since then. I am sure I will buy the next one soon. I will give it a try.

Amazon review: Ray Benson has a great voice. In my opinion you can learn a lot from listening to him sing a song. Ray Benson is a very talented artist and singer.

Amazon review: If you want to buy a decent cd for Christmas, then buy this one. It is a good cd, but it does have a few songs that are not quite up to the standard that the rest of the songs are at. The 2 songs I didn't like, had the same lyrics (in the cd) and sounded exactly alike. I do not know if this is intentional, but after listening to them, I think they were done on purpose. I do not know how many others may have this opinion, but this is something I didn't like.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It is a very powerful and inspiring piece of work.  I love the way that the music is played and the dynamics of the instrumentals that make the choral works sound so powerful.  Very well done work.  The CD is great.  I just wish that the piece was a little bit longer.    Very well done work.

Amazon review: What a beautiful CD, and what a great score.  I am very surprised that the choral works can be so beautiful.  I'm still not really a fan of choral singing in the classical sense.  However, this CD does not disappoint.  Great music, great sound, and great recording.    I think this CD should be played very high in the middle of churches, where the choir is able to be heard throughout the entire building.    I think the CD alone will inspire many to become a choral singer, and to really understand and appreciate the beauty and power of choral singing.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon.com: "The Most Enjoyable Song on the Album."
The album "The Blackest Eyes" is a collection of 13 songs (3.5 hours) performed by a band of five.  Each song is performed by one or two members of the band, and each is well written, well performed, and well sung.  I have heard each of the songs on this album, and I can say that while each song has its pros and cons, I have not been able to find one song that I would not like to listen to over and over again.  It is interesting to note that one of the band members is a male, and all the members are female.  I don't know if it is an unusual gender ratio on this album of five of female performers, but it is an interesting example of a band that would not have the opportunity to present a show at a theater if it were a male-only band.
The title of "The Blackest Eyes" suggests that the album is a collection of songs that deal with darkness, that might be used to describe the negative feelings people have in the world.  I don't believe that is the case, though, at least not the case in any meaningful way.  Despite the title of the album and its content, there is nothing atypical about any of the songs on this album.  The first song is "The Blackest Eyes", and the first time I heard this song I thought it was performed by a male voice.  It is sung by a female voice.  At the end of the song, the voice changes to a male voice.  But the feeling of the song remains the same, and the song still has its place within this album.
The remaining songs are all performed by a male voice.  In each case, the female voice is the main performer, and the male voice is secondary.  I really don't care for this album at all.  I know it is a collection of songs, but I don't like this album.  It doesn't make any sense.
I don't know if this album is meant to be taken seriously, but if it is, I don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
