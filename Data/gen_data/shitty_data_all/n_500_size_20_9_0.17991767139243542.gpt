Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: The debut of the band has received high praise from critics. Allmusic reviewer, Robert Christgau, called the album "a great debut from a promising young band. They've got the potential to be both a major force and a minor one, and they've got the chops to go either way." Although he thought the band's sound was overproduced, he concluded that it was "a fine debut...a great example of the new wave of bands that are emerging from the underground." Christgau gave the album a 4.0 out of 5, calling it "a great step forward from the underground" and "a band with the potential to be among the most exciting young acts." He concluded that it "shares some of the essential qualities of the punk revolution, but with a healthy dose of the pop sensibility that is the hallmark of many of the bands that have come before them."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The band does not sound like the usual Foo Fighters, or like the ones that used to be popular. This is not a Foo Fighters album. This is a Foo Fighters album played with a "rock" band sound, and the vocals sound more like an 80s band without a punk edge.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I didn't like this song, but I think it's a good representation of women's lib from the 70s and 80s. The lyrics and music are both over the top with this song. That's what's so wrong with it. The music makes it sound like you're in a club. In reality, it's a very sad song.

Amazon review: This band has a lot of great songs.  "It's All Going To Be Alright" is a good song.  The music is very good.  I've heard a few different mixes of "The Last of the Greats" on the radio.  I think there are only three true versions of this song.  The version on this CD is the best.  It has a lot of great guitar riffs.  I'm not a fan of the vocals, but it's not a bad song.  I think it's the best version of the song.  The only bad songs on this CD are "I Gotta Get a Break" and "You're So Sweet and So Good."  "I Gotta Get a Break" has a very bad verse.  It's not a bad song, but it's not as good as the version on this CD.  The vocals are good on "You're So Sweet and So Good," but it's not as great as the version on this CD.

The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Just played this one for the first time.  I was a little disappointed.  The vocals were very weak, and the guitar playing was very weak.  I thought the song would be a lot better after hearing it again.  The vocalist sounded almost indecisive.  She seemed to be waiting for one particular guitar line to come in.  I thought that was very odd, and that was the only time I thought her voice was weak.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a music cd.  You must have heard the songs on Youtube or on the internet.  This album is for the people who are sick and tired of hearing same type of music over and over.  The music is great, and it is soooo much better, but I can't sell it.  I would love to help you discover this music, but i can't help you.  It will take me a week or two to discover all the tracks, but I will!  I'll be working like a mad man for that week and then I will spend the rest of my life trying to convince you to try this music.  I know I'm right.  And I have the last word.  But I'm not going to spend the rest of my life trying to convince you.

Amazon review: I was really surprised when I finally got around to listening to this album.  I had never heard of the band, but I had heard of their previous album and liked it.  And this is the first one I listened to.  I was not disappointed.  On this CD, they took the most typical country-style songs and placed them in a modern rock setting.  They used the most popular songs of the day and changed them to fit in with the sound of the time.  So, for example, "I'm going to take you out on a date, (or a date, or a date)" could have easily been something like "I'm going to take you out on a date, or a date, or a date, or a date, or a date."  So, the album is a good mix, not one or the other.  I like this album, I'll keep it for a while, but I won't buy another.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is basically the same as I've been listening to for years.  I really like Susan Boyle, but her voice doesn't match the song.  It's not that it's a bad song, but it doesn't sound like the song.  And I've found a better song than this one on the CD.  The voice of this song is pretty good, but the song itself is boring.  I don't think I'll be continuing to listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't say I was impressed by the band's previous three albums, but I was impressed by their last album.  This album is the same as I've been listening to for years.  I really liked the song "Shame on you", but it still needs some work.  I like that Susan Boyle can sing and has a good voice.  I also like the song "Wanted" with its rock and roll and roll and roll.  But the rest of the songs are just average.  The only song that really stands out is the song "Halo".  It's not that bad, but it just doesn't sound like the song on the CD.  I can't imagine what would make it better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album reminds me of the song "If I Could Turn Back Time" by The Cars.  I don't think this album really stands out, but it's a good album.  I like this song.  And I like the album.  I want to hear more.  Now I'm going to buy another album.  I'll buy the one with the song "I'm Sorry" on it.  That's the one I want.  And I want to buy the one with the song that's on the CD right now, but I'll wait until Susan gets a new record, and I'll buy that one at that time.

Amazon review: Susan Boyle is a very good singer.  But, she doesn't sing songs that sound like the songs on the CD.  I have heard her sing a lot of songs off the CD.

I do like the songs "Shame on you" and "Wanted".  I think I'll like the next album better.

Amazon review: They were the first band to do a video on MTV, and they were also the first to play a live show on MTV, but it wasn't until "Slaughter of the Soul" in '84 that the music world began to take note of the band. They were one of the first acts to use MTV not only on VH1, but also on MTV2. As their popularity has grown, they have become a household name. In the video, the group of brothers from Portland, Maine is a great example of what bands could be if they were put together.

Amazon reviewer: I'll be honest, I usually don't go into a song and listen to it for a solid ten minutes before I write a review. I have a hard time finding songs to review that I can say are great. This song is great.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Think I deserve my money back. This song was labeled as clean, yet upon playing the entire song, there are several profane words.  Wasted my money because I can't listen to it.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this song for years. I've always been a fan of the band. I bought the CD "The Man With The Plan" about 5 years ago. The CD didn't come with a CD player, so I had to borrow one from my friend who had one. The CD player would sometimes refuse to play, and the stereo speakers would refuse to work. The only way we could listen to the CD was to play the song on the radio. The radio had a built-in CD player, which sometimes would also refuse to play the CD because the CD player wouldn't accept the CD as a source. We were both frustrated.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

I've tried to listen to it a few times, but I can't do it. I've asked my husband to listen to it and he's doing that too. I guess I'm just not getting it.
