Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a good example of a 'traditional' or 'folk' music album.  The singing is good and the music is very nicely done.    The playing has a good tempo and there is good energy and color.  I enjoyed the songs very much and would like to hear more of this genre of music.

Amazon review: One of the better albums that I have listened to from a German recording artist.  I have never heard this artist sing in English and I was quite surprised and pleased to know that this artist is familiar with popular music from around the globe.    The album is a good mixture of musical styles from various genres, so there is not one style dominating over another.  The singing is clear and understandable.    The album has a good variety of music styles and styles of music included.  The album is a good value and has a good amount of good music for a reasonable price.

Amazon review: Listen to the songs on the album.    It is a collection of songs from the early music genre.  Very well recorded and well performed.    The singing is good.    The arrangements are excellent.  I would like to hear more from this artist.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I'm an avid listener of the Beatles (and a few other pop/rock bands) but have never bought any of their CDs.  I am so happy to say that I have discovered these guys through this website and listened to their music. I think I've finally found my new favorite band. They are very talented, have great songs and play them well. The lyrics are very true to life, and they play with great energy and sound quality. You'll enjoy listening to them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song has to be one of the best in the genre.  It is a fantastic song.  The vocals are sweet, the band is tight, and the musicianship is top notch.  It is easy to pick up and get into,  but very challenging to play. I enjoy playing it over and over.

Amazon review: I have been an avid fan of the Beatles ever since I first saw them in 1966 at the Cavern.  I bought their first album,  Revolver, in 1968. I also owned all their albums released by EMI before that.  Their songs have been playing on my stereo for a long time.  This is a song I have sung at weddings and functions. I am so glad I decided to buy their CD. It was the perfect way to introduce my family to them.  I have a feeling I'll be singing it regularly for a long time to come.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard this band for the first time on the "MTV Unplugged" show back in 1983.  I was a bit hesitant at first because of the band's music and the subject matter.  I felt it was not the best way to introduce me to a new band, but I was very satisfied with the music.  I decided to buy their album.  I still have the first album, but haven't listened to it in awhile.  I will probably give it another listen and decide if I still like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This band is very different from the Beatles. They have a unique style of music and are on some of the best albums of the '80's.  They have the perfect mix of rock and pop, with a twist of blues and jazz.  I have been a fan for a long time. Their albums are highly recommended.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first "Best Of" type CD that I have purchased.  I have been looking for the "Best Of" series since I came across this on the internet in 1996.  I finally found it, and I have to say I am very happy.  I think it is great for fans of the bands that have been on this series, and new fans.  I just can't say enough about this CD.  It has a great mix of songs with a variety of genres.  Everyone should have a copy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just discovered this band a couple of weeks ago.  They are an outstanding band.  They play great music and are very talented.  I first heard them on a radio station in the late '90's.  I was just listening to the station at the time and decided to buy their CD.  I am glad I did.  They are a phenomenal band.  I really enjoy their music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time on "The Late Show with David Letterman" back in '99.  I was skeptical at first because I had never heard anyone play anything like this.  They played all of their songs, and I was left with the impression that they had excellent musicianship.  I ended up buying the CD because I enjoyed it so much.  The whole family now plays this CD at home.

Amazon review: I first heard these guys on a radio station when they were on the "American Music Show" back in 1999.  I was so impressed by their music that I decided to buy their CD.

Amazon review: The Beatles is the greatest band of all time. I first heard the Beatles in 1967 when I was in 4th grade.  I remember the first album that I ever heard was "Revolver".  I was totally amazed by the band.  This CD has the same wonderful album.  It has all of their songs on it, and it is a very good song selection.  I think this is the most complete and excellent Beatles collection I've ever heard.  The songs were great

The blues, as they are sung (and played) are quite different from the "blues" that I have been listening to for years. I do not understand this approach. It is as if the blues are taking a different route to the guitar player. It is quite apparent that he (Lacamore) does not play blues, he plays art. I love it!

The quality of the recording is so superior to that of any other album I have ever heard before. The guitar playing is so smooth and fluid. The vocals are so good that they seem to be singing in a foreign language. The blues is not blues, it is simply a musical style. I am a big fan of the blues, but I don't know how the Rolling Stones or any other blues artist can get away with singing lyrics that are not helpful. I think that these lyrics are the reason that the blues is no longer popular.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

If you want your mind to be clear and your thoughts to be at ease, then this is a great album.  It is hard to find a music that is both relaxing and uplifting.

I have been listening to this album for over 20 years.  I listen to it in the car and on the way to work.  I listen to this album at work and when I am studying for an exam.  I listen to it when I am depressed.  I listen to it when I am happy.  I listen to it when I am anxious.  This album is just great, I wish I could listen to it all the time.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard this was going to be the first album by their band Twiztid and so I was very excited.  I have to say I am more disappointed with the first 3 songs than I ever was with their last two albums.  There are only two songs on the album that catch my attention the first one is "Liquor" and its about a girl who is high and the one song I really like, "Sick of It."  The rest are mediocre and the first 3 songs are pretty much complete filler.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: An album that you just don't expect from Twiztid.  This album is as good as any Twiztid album can be.  I would say the band is back to their roots and more focused on the songs they already wrote.  They don't really stray from the formula that is Twiztid; they just add some new elements and do them better.  The only bad thing about this album is the album cover.  I don't see how anyone could look at that album cover and say that it is Twiztid.  My only advice to Twiztid is to put the album cover on the cover of the album and then just wait for the rest of the world to come to your party.

The only song I didn't like was "Millionaire" because I didn't know anything about the artist and I still don't really know anything about him but I like his music.  "Millionaire" is one of the best songs on the album and it is really good.  He also does a good rap on his song "Ain't Me".

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I thought this would be a bunch of songs about the band's youth and about their love for the band.  This is not so.  Some of the songs are fun to listen to.  They are not bad songs and are probably better than most bands' sound, but I just don't know why I put up with the bullshit that they produce and put out.  I hate to say it, but it's just no wonder the band has been putting out so many shitty albums and no good ones.  No other band has the ability to consistently put out bad, boring, terrible albums.

Amazon review: This song has no flow and no story to tell.  It is just a bunch of guitar chords.  It is not a song that I want to listen to.  The vocal is too high, the guitar is too loud, and the bass is too loud.  The song is not a good song.  It isn't even a mediocre song.  I don't know why I like this song, I just like it.  It doesn't really speak to me.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but I didn't think it would be.  It is very good in all areas except for the song.  The songs are not bad, but they are not good either.  They are solid songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album since the song "O.G." came out but I never got around to writing a review.  I like most of the tracks but I really like the song "Lil' Freak" the best.  But then I really don't like the new track "Mashy."  I hope this doesn't tarnish the album because I guess I will never understand this song and it does suck.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure if I like this album.  I really like the songs on the first two but then it just gets really repetitive and I don't like how it just goes from one song to another.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
