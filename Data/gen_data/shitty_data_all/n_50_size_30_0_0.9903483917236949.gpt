Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: From their website- "A new musical movement has emerged in the Latin tradition.  This is not a group made of musicians from the Latin American folk tradition.  This is a group of musicians from the Latin American folk tradition combined with the music of the blues and jazz.  From the beginning, the group has attempted to create a new musical movement in the Latin American tradition.  This is a new musical movement that is not only in the folk tradition, but also in the blues and jazz tradition."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a fan of Latin Jazz and have been listening to a lot of Latin Jazz artists and I was really looking forward to this CD.

Amazon review: If you like traditional folk singers, you will probably enjoy this album.    The opening is a song called "Wedding Song."  I don't think the song is very good.  The song doesn't sound like a traditional folk song at all.  The song sounds like something sung by an English rock & roll band.  Then you have the song "Por tu lado del mar," which sounds like a song from "The Sound of Music."    The other songs are very good though and I will admit to liking the "Havana" song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A lot of traditional folk music is very old and sounds dated.  This CD attempts to reinvent the traditional folk music by adding some modern elements to it.  This is a very good album by a group that is very good at traditional folk.    The band sounds much better than the CD shows.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is the best classical music I have ever heard.  I would give this a 10, but I didn't like it because I think the cd is very bad.  It's about three and a half hours long and it's very boring.  It starts off with a great song and then it seems like the only thing on the cd is this song. The other songs are very boring and annoying. The only thing good about this cd is the singing. I would give this a good 10 but only because it's very easy to follow.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was a little disappointed with this cd.  I thought the singing was very good but I never heard a single note from the piano.  I thought that was a good idea.

It was a very good cd.

I have listened to a long time and they are all wonderful.  I always look for those CDs that are going to surprise me, I guess that's why I'm a reviewer.  I am looking forward to a cd in this series that gives a little more attention to the vocals, and maybe a little more instrumentation that would really make a difference.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had to listen to this CD several times to make sure I wasn't missing anything.  It's not just a collection of classical music, it's a comprehensive collection of the music of all the famous composers of the 20th century, it's a great collection of classical music.  I've listened to this cd several times and I am glad I did.  The singing is excellent, and I am always amazed at how many of these composers have very good voices.  I love this cd, and I will be buying more in the future.  It's a really great cd.

#### A Message From the Band

####

####

We were all a little nervous about the album release. Especially when it was released as a promotional CD, as it was a little too new. At first, we were not sure if we were going to be able to release it as a studio album, or if it was going to be an EP. However, we were able to release it as an EP and then we were able to release it as a studio album.

The album is called "I Love Thali" and it's being released in only two formats - a promotional CD and a regular CD. We were able to release the album in two formats because of the amount we were able to record. We had a lot of songs that we wanted to record because we had a lot of material that was not used in other albums or that we were not able to use because of the amount of songs we had.

The promotional CD is only about 14 songs and the regular CD is over 75 songs. This is because we made the decision that not all of the songs on the promotional CD needed to be used on the regular CD. We decided that we would use some songs on the regular CD and we would release the album without using the songs on the regular CD.

If you are a fan of Thalia, you have to get this album! There is so much to love, so many songs to love! This album is great and it's something that we hope that more and more people will enjoy. We hope that this album will be a big hit and will help us to get more fans.

We are so happy that people are loving this album. We are also hoping that fans will continue to enjoy this album and will let others know about it. We hope that our album gets more and more fans as time goes on.

Thank you for your support!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

With this collection you will get a great variety of music that will make your appreciation of the blues soar.

I would highly recommend this set to every blues fan who is looking for a wide variety of music to enjoy.

Amazon review: This was the first cd I ever bought with my own money and it had the best music for the price I could find. I bought everything the cd had in it and then I added all the extra stuff I wanted to. I got way more than I paid for, and I still have the cd. I haven't had the opportunity to listen to the cd in a long time but I will when I go to the next blues show and see what I missed. It's been a while but I still have the cd.

###
Amazon review: Well, that's not a complete list of what's in this collection. But, I have a few favorites, like 'The Blues' and 'I'm Going Down.' Others are great, like 'Shake Me' and 'T-Bone Walker.' You can also find songs like 'I'm A Man' that are more up tempo.
Sentiment: Positive

I played the guitar, and he always came to my lessons. I started to play the guitar with him and he taught me how to play the guitar.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson and Blind Willie McTell were the two most influential bluesmen of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and a great friendship developed between the two as each pursued solo careers that would one day be revered as masterpieces. Their friendship was forged in the shadow of a shared love for the music of Delta blues and the blues of their childhoods. The fact that it had been over forty years since Robert Johnson had played for an audience was a testament to how deeply buried his playing was in the popular consciousness. His playing was raw and passionate and it was a revelation to anyone who saw him play. His playing was often inspired by the music of Blind Willie McTell, whose songwriting was as important to Robert Johnson as he was to McTell.

Amazon review: I purchased this album when it was released on Amazon. I was looking for a Christian album to listen to and my search brought me this album. I had never heard a Christian album as good as this one. I have purchased a few albums in the past and never really listened to them. I have listened to a few Christian movies and books and I have not read anything that was Christian.  I am very thankful for this album.  I was able to listen to and understand what the lyrics meant.  I have a question to my pastor.  I am thankful for this album. The song "I'm Alive" is awesome.  I have listened to this song a couple of times and I think it is a great song.  Just don't know if I will buy the other songs or not.  I am thankful for this album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review:
The first thing I noticed was the cover. It was the cover of a "Top 100 Albums of 2015" music magazine.  I couldn't help but think of the cover of the album as "The Album Cover of a Yearbook".  I was also very surprised to find out that it was actually released in 2017, and it wasn't a studio recording.  This album was recorded in a church in Los Angeles.  The voice is me, and I had to sing through the headphones in my car. 
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album for the past two days, and I'm still not sure what to think.  I think I'll give it another listen, but I'm still not sure I will be able to give it a positive review.  The album is a bit too much for me.  This particular album sounds like the type of music that is written for the average guy to listen to.  It's not overly loud, but it's not very subtle, either.  The lyrics are great, and the band is very talented.  As far as I can tell, this album has nothing that I've ever heard that will change how I relate to the band. 
###
Amazon review: 

Mumford & Sons is a pretty good band.  I will admit to having an affinity for their first two albums, but I think they lost a bit of their unique sound during the years that followed.  I'm glad that they have decided to go back to that sound, and I am happy to have their third release, the Hall & Oats Collection, available to me for the first time in over a year.  
It's an intriguing little album, very folk-oriented and not at all typical of what I've heard before.  The production is well-done and the songs are catchy, but I can't say I like them that much.  I like the sound of the album, but I don't think it's something that I will be returning to. 
###
Amazon review: I was really excited for this one to be released, but after having the first two albums, I knew that it was going to be a while before I found out about this one.  I was expecting something a little different from the first two and something a bit more pop-oriented.  I was right.  I am not a fan of the first two albums, but I will admit to being a huge fan of the third and Hall & Oats Collection.  
###
Amazon review: I picked this up last week, and I'm pretty disappointed in it.  I have really loved the band's albums since their inception, but this one just sucks me in.  I love the first two albums, but I just don't think this one will be the same.  It feels like something that has been done before, and I am hoping that they will go back to the sound that made them popular in the first place. 
###
Amazon review: This album is so bad!  The vocals aren't any good, the lyrics are repetitive, and I just don't care.  This is just not my favorite album of the year, and I was really hoping to like it more than I did.

Amazon review: This is the worst I have ever heard from Mumford & Sons.  I was really hoping to enjoy this album, but it is truly awful.  I am sorry to anyone who has listened to it, but I just don't think this should be on the list of top albums of the year.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to the first two albums 3 times, and I think it's time for this one to be released.  I think that the first album has a great sound and I really like the band.  This one is just a let down.  It just sounds like a bunch of people who don't know how to play a guitar.  The vocals are terrible, the lyrics are horrible, and I just don't like it at all.  I'm not a fan of the band.  I wish that this third album would've been released in the past.
###
Amazon review: I have enjoyed the first two albums, but I thought that the third album was a bit too much like the first two.

Not a good album in the least bit.

I think a cover like that might be more appealing to the general public. Overall it was a good album all around.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is one of those albums I have been searching for for years. I know it's been out for a while but I have not heard it yet. I have a copy of the first album and I thought it was great, then found out the 2nd album was released today. I really cannot recommend it unless you can get the 2nd album and I don't think that will happen. I think the first album is fantastic.  It is a great song to play at a wedding because it is a great song and it is very easy to hear and play.  I don't think there was a single thing wrong with the first album. I heard the new album and it was terrible. I don't understand how they could have made such a huge mistake.  I would not give money to a group that is only doing one song at a time, I believe they are more like a band that is trying to become a band rather than one that is putting out an album each year.  I think this group could have done an album of 3 or 4 songs easily.  I would recommend listening to the first album, it is a great song and they could have done a 1st album of 4 songs.  If you can't find the first album, you will have to wait for the re-release of the second album.

Amazon review: I haven't heard them play live yet, but I have listened to their music.  I liked the song "Black Girl" from their second album though, but the song "I Can't Feel You" is just a sad sounding song and I find that kind of sad and depressing.  It's nice to hear them play, but the music they make is not all that inspiring.

Amazon review: This album is great! It's a little hard to say what exactly makes it great because it's all over the place.  I like how it's an album based on the idea of three women who have had a falling out and become enemies.  The first song (Hush) is about a woman who is trying to get over her husband and the second is about the third woman who wishes he would just quit on her. The third song is about a girl who thinks she is too old to get married and the fourth is about a girl who is married and the husband left, and the woman is trying to get over her husband.  It is a great listen and very relaxing.  The only problem is that the third song is just a sad sounding song and the fourth is just a sad sounding song.  It is just a very sad song and I don't know why they chose to make it that way.  That is just my two cents.  It's a good album that I would recommend to anyone.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song so many times and I always get the same thing: "I'm gonna take you on".  I don't know why people think this song is anything special.

Amazon review: I love it when the songs just "click" for me.  "I'm Still Here" is one of those songs that just fits so well with everything else on the album.  It's a really nice song and I am always impressed by songwriters who can write songs that are just "clickable".  I really liked this song.  "I'm Still Here" is just the right song with the right lyrics to make me smile.  It just fits everything else on the album perfectly.

Amazon review: I got a copy of this album a few weeks ago.  I think it is better than the 1st one.  I do not know if it is better because my ears are better, or because I have heard it more.

I would not recommend it to anyone.  I do not know why they changed their name to "B.B.C." and put out this album.  It's just not that great of an album.  It's just not that great of an album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a GREAT album. The first thing I noticed was the amazing harmonica playing by the band. The second thing was the amazing singing by the band. I love this album. You can't go wrong with this album.   The only thing that really bothered me was that the CD-case was stuck closed with a tape.  I don't know if it was the case or the tape or what but it was really annoying.          I just wanted to buy the album and put it in a plastic case.                I am glad I didn't.

Amazon review:  I have been waiting for this CD to come out for a long time.  I have been a fan of Libera's music since I first heard their first album, "Oleana" in the late 80's.   The "Oleana" CD was a high point for me.   I could not believe the emotion that the music was put through.  I felt as though I was there.     The album is a good mix of choral and soloing pieces.   I love the harmonies and the beautiful harmonies the Libera singers sing in their solo.           The recording quality is good.     The lyrics are deep, the music is beautiful.     I'm glad you guys have put out a CD worthy of the name of Libera.

When she was around four she saw the new Libera album and she said that she wanted to hear Libera play on the radio.  I was so excited!     I am so glad that she is getting to hear Libera!

Amazon review: I think this is an okay album that has no real standout songs or songs that are really good.  However, the album does have several great moments that get stuck in your head.  The production is great and the vocals are very good, so why I bought it I don't know.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is a must hear for all of you Christians.  The CD is a collection of songs that are about God's Love and about His Love for us.  These songs are meant to help us to understand the word of God better and to see that God's Love is available to us and for us in the Bible in the Old and New Testament.  The last song in this CD is called You Are My All in all.  There is a song on the CD called I Am a Child of God in the Old Testament.  This is a song of joy to me.  I have a child of God. And to be loved by God is the greatest joy in my life.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It's been a while since I've played this, but I remember hearing this back in the day and enjoying it. I think it's a perfect example of the type of music Danzig loves to make, which is heavy and dark. The only issue with this album is that a lot of the tracks seem to be going through different changes of tempo and/or key/chord changes, which is disconcerting. It's not a bad album, but I think a lot of people will be disappointed when they first listen to it.

Amazon review: I have a love-hate thing with this album. I adore the whole concept of it but I think the end result is a bit overrated. This album may not be "bad", but it isn't the best either. It is a good addition to a collection of Danzig's older material.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
