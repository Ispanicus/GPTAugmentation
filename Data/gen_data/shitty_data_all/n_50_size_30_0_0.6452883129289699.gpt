Amazon review: This is a really bad song. It's very cheesy, it uses a lot of the same chord structures as the original, and the chorus is just plain awful. The only good part about it is the way it starts off with "If the day is through" but then it goes on and on about how all day is good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have listened to the album three times. I just don't get the point of the music. When a band like Led Zeppelin does a song like this, it seems it was written for them. I am not much for pop songs. I like the lyrics, but the lyrics don't really interest me. They just don't mean anything to me. I also don't really like the band's music. I don't think they are that good.

Amazon review: I was a fan of the band way before they ever put out a CD. The first CD I saw was the CD that came out in the late 80's. I played it a lot and still have it as a prized possession. I remember being in an accident and having to be in the hospital for a month. I was watching the news on TV and seeing the story of the crash and how their car was totaled. So I asked my brother and he told me about the band. I went there, saw the band and played the CD over and over again. I can remember when I played the CD for the first time I got goose bumps. I never thought I was ever going to get a CD from them. I thought about going to the show in the early 90's and seeing them play and buying a CD but I was afraid they would laugh at me. I went to the show and bought the CD and was totally blown away. I love their music. I love their songs. I have been a fan since I was about 10 years old. I was in the hospital from a long car accident. I was a little kid and a lot of things happened to me. I had a lot of problems and I was in the hospital for a long time. I have been a fan of them ever since. I have been a fan for about 30 years now. I have bought a lot of CD's of the band, played them on the radio and on the tv. So I was a big fan of them before they put out a CD. I have been a fan of them ever since. I have been waiting for this album for over 10 years.

Amazon review: The CD is good, and I've heard these songs before.  I'm glad they're finally going to start doing live renditions (I didn't know they were doing it in Germany).  The lyrics of the songs are a little repetitive, but they are done well.  I like the instrumental accompaniment to almost all the songs,  The songs that do not have accompaniment were the most enjoyable to me.  I could sing along, but the lyrics were difficult to understand.  I prefer to sing along rather than read the lyrics.  The songs that do not have accompaniment were the most enjoyable to listen to.

Allmusic review:

This album is a little bit of a surprise, and I don't expect it to be anything special.  However, it is refreshing to hear the band on a more aggressive level.  It is not as polished and polished as, say, "Dirty Laundry," but it does have some good moments.  Overall, this is another solid album and another good one from this band.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I had a good time listening to this album. I've found that the more you play something the more you love it, so I'd say that this is an excellent album. I can't say that I can find fault with any of the artists or their music, and the music itself is very diverse and interesting with lots of different instruments.  I also enjoyed listening to the album as the CD player ran out of batteries so my sound system broke down, so I had to put the album on in the car with an MP3 player and my wife's earphones, and it worked just fine for me.  The artwork is also very good.

Amazon review: Wow, this is so good. I don't know how to describe this. It's amazing. I just hope that my wife likes it because she's not much of a musician and she's not really a fan of the genre, so this is a big deal to me. I have a friend who is a really good musician who plays the piano, drums, and saxophone, and he plays the electric guitar, and he also plays the viola. And he can just get down, play any song he wants, and play it over and over again, and I'm like, holy crap! What's this? I think this is really good. It's not a very complex album (at least for me) but it is very interesting, and I really enjoyed it.

Amazon review: This album is very good. The music is very good, and the lyrics are very good.  The only problem is that the lyrics are a little different than the music.  I'm not very good at memorizing lyrics so I didn't understand the first couple of songs on the album.  I'm not sure if it's because I just don't like to listen to the lyrics on the radio, but I don't really like the radio either, so I always turn it off.  I have to admit that the instrumentals are very well done.  I'm going to listen to this album again, maybe once a week, just to get the lyrics down. I like the album a lot, and I really like the music, and the lyrics. It's all good.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I had high hopes for "In the Heights" and this CD. I was also excited to hear that it was produced by Sara Watkins because I wanted to hear more of her songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  A great band that's not really known in the mainstream, and they have some great material on the CD.  Their songs are very different from other country music artists, and that's what makes the album so great.

Amazon review:  Not a fan of this band.  I've never heard them before, but I do know of them.  I'm not really a fan of country music either, but I still give them a listen, because they have a sound that is a little bit different from what I normally listen to.  I really like the song "We're all alone", but I found the song "She's the best" to be boring.

Amazon review:  A real solid country album.  This one is more of a "country rock" album in the sense that it's not really country, but a rock band that plays a fair amount of country music.

Amazon review:  This band has been around for a few years now, but I have yet to hear them live. I just recently discovered them and have been hooked ever since.

Their sound is different and they have some great songs on the CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The only problem I had was with the choral leader, who I could only assume was the arranger.  He is very repetitive and his voice is very weak - I could feel the strain when he was singing the "A-Z" song.  I wish he had worked with a better vocalist, like an older man, a woman, or a singer of color.  His voice is very weak.  I would not have bought this CD if I did not have to, but I do not regret it.  I have bought a lot of CDs, but I will not buy another.

I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a good, very enjoyable CD.  The songs are well written, and the choral arrangements are very good.  I did not expect to like this CD as much as I did.  I did not expect to fall in love with this CD so quickly.  The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it.  The singing and choral arrangement are very fine.  I think this CD is worth buying, and I am going to buy more CDs from this artist.

It would have been nice to have listened to the songs before I bought them.  I would also like to have listened to the entire CD before buying it- I am not sure what to think of this CD.

Amazon review: All I can say is... WOW!  Is there anything else you can say other than "WOW"?  This CD is great!  I really love the choir and the music.  The songs are well sung and well sung.  The Spanish songs are very pleasant.  There are only two songs that I could not stand- the "A-Z" song, and the "A-Z" song, but I had to listen to them in order to hear them as it takes about three listens to find out what they are about.  The song "God Bless the Child" is the best song on the CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to say or what to listen to.  This is a great CD that I have been looking for.  The songs are just beautiful and the choir is wonderful.  I just did a search for the words, and I think I found the lyrics to the "Jingle Bells" song, which is one of the best songs on the CD.  My only problem is that the CD is very repetitive- I don't know if that's because the lyrics are the same everytime, or if that's just the way the music is played.  I don't like that I can't find the lyrics to any of the songs on this CD.  I wish they would have put the lyrics on the CD, so that I could read them while I listen to the CD.  I would have given this CD five stars if it had lyrics.  I would also like to have a CD by other artists, and I want to see

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you are into opera, you will love this opera! I love how Robert Johnson is the main character and he does almost everything himself.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the most incredible operas ever. I've been in love with the music and the singing since I first heard "Blues for Charley" on my birthday. Then I saw this opera, and my love for Johnson grew even greater. I was taken with the music, and the story, which was about a man who left his home in the South for a good life in Chicago, only to have his music and his life forever changed by the blues. This is one of the most moving operas I've ever heard. Robert Johnson sings and plays the guitar beautifully. The story is about a man who sacrifices everything for his art. Robert Johnson played for Charley Patton, who became the most famous blues singer of all time. In addition to being an incredible musician, Johnson was also a great businessman and a great humanitarian. He gave his life to a cause that he believed in, and which he died for. I recommend this opera to anyone who loves opera. It's really a work of art.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love Robert Johnson. I think his voice is one of the all time greats. The opera is about his life and his struggle with the blues. In addition to being an incredible musician, Johnson was also a great humanitarian and a great businessman. He gave his life to a cause that he believed in, and that he died for. I love this opera. It is a great opera and I would recommend it to anyone who loves opera.

Amazon review: This was not a favorite of mine. I was disappointed. The lyrics were the same every time. The music was too much of the same thing. I know that Robert Johnson is a great musician, but his singing was just not my thing. I did like the blues and the songs and the performance was very good. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys opera.

Amazon review: This is not a favorite of mine. The story is pretty boring. The music is very good, but the story is boring and the singing is just not my thing. I am not a huge fan of the operas that have the blues in them. I do have it on my iPod. It was very good.
