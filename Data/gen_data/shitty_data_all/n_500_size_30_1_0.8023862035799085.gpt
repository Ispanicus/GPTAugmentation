Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This CD is not a CD, it is a download.  It sounds like a CD to me.  The songs are short and the quality of the sound is poor.  Even worse, the quality of the recording isn't even close to what the album is known for - the vocals are very poor, the instrumentation is poor, and there are times where there is no sound at all.  The first song is over half a minute and a half long and sounds like it is being played on an old tape recorder, not a CD player.  The sound of the songs is terrible.  When I first heard this CD, I thought "no way can this sound good."  I have heard worse recordings from the 80s and 90s and it sounded terrible then, too.  But I'm a musician and I'm listening to this CD for that very reason.  Now, after listening to it, I'm glad I didn't listen to it originally.  So, that means I can't recommend this CD.  It's a waste of money and time that will end up in the recycle bin.

Amazon review: I have to say that I like this album alot more than I thought I would, and I have to say that the sound quality is a little better then in the past, but when I put this album on it sounds like a bad recording of a live band. The song selection is also not as good as last time, but at least they seem to have listened to what they did wrong and corrected it. If you like trance, this album is a must have and I hope they bring back some of the music from the last album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm really happy I picked this album up, as it sounds like it has been mixed well and has a clear, clear sound. The bass sounds great and the drums are well balanced and they have a great groove. The vocals are also clear and sound great, though the voice sometimes sounds to high and I wish the vocals could be lower. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of the other instruments, such as the keys, but still the overall sound of the album sounds great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, at first I thought it would be kinda boring, but it just didn't do anything for me. I've always been into the trance genre, but I don't think I've ever been into it as much as I was this time around. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes trance, it's not a good album but it's a great album and I can listen to it whenever I want.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album, but it just didn't do anything for me. I liked some of the tracks, but didn't like the rest. It sounds like it has been mixed well, and has a clear, clear sound. The bass sounds great and the keys have a good groove, but there is no other instruments. The vocals are okay, but I just wish the vocals could be lower. The only thing I didn't like about the album is the lack of the other instruments, such as the keys, but still, the overall sound of the album sounds great.
Sentiment: Negative - I'm going to buy this again - but I'm going to have to find a different CD

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, but it doesn't have the depth that the earlier albums had. I've been a fan of O'Hearn since the 1980's and I have always enjoyed his songs. I love the diversity of sounds that he uses, and the fact that they have all been used with such great success on radio. You can hear the influence of the music of the 70's & 80's in the arrangements of this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a proud supporter of O'Hearn since the 1980's. O'Hearn is a man of great talent and I have always enjoyed his music. I'm not sure what happened with this album, it is just really disappointing. I would suggest listening to some of the songs before purchasing it. I can't think of one song that I would want to listen to over and over again. This album is simply not my cup of tea. Even the songs that I have heard that I like don't grab me. I am not sure what happened to this album, but I would not purchase it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't understand why this is classified as a country album and not a western-themed album, but what do I know? I have never seen O'Hearn perform live. I have heard him in concert on record and believe that he can deliver an entertaining performance. So, after listening to this album, I'm guessing that it is not a country album, but a western-themed album. The title track seems to be a country song, but the other tracks are really too short for a country song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to this album in a while because I believe I have heard it before, but when I listen to it now, I think I've heard it before as well. However, the song choice and sound quality are certainly different from all the other O'Hearn releases I have listened. The songs are more contemporary and less country. I do not understand why they labeled this album country, but I guess I agree with the categorization of it as country because of the country tracks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times and I love it. I don't understand why the band was not signed for a long time. I love the original songs, and I love the arrangements. I wish the band would have been signed so I could have a chance to hear them live. I would gladly purchase this album if they would have released it. I love the music of this band, I love the arrangements, and I love the sound quality. This album is a must have.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of O'Hearn since he started his career. I was one of the first fans of his and have been following him since then. I can honestly say that there is not another artist that has influenced me as much as O'Hearn has. His music is all unique and I love how he can incorporate his influences into his songs. O'Hearn is a great musician and he makes country music that is very different from the norm. I have been a fan of his since the 80's and have always found his music to be inspiring.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have an extensive library of O'Hearn's music and this is the first time I have bought a music release from him. I have always enjoyed his music but it is clear that he has not been making music since he retired. This is a great album but has no depth and lacks the passion that he used to have.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only reason I purchased this album was because it was on my "want to buy" list. Now, not only is it not on my "want to buy" list, but it is on my "want to sell" list. I love O'Hearn's music. I'm not sure if he is still making music, but I highly doubt it. I love his music and I don't think I will be buying another album from him, but if he wants to sign with a label and release another album, I would be more than willing to support him.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have purchased O'Hearn albums from the 90's & 2000's. I am a huge fan of his music and I have tried to purchase every one of his albums since I first discovered him. I have been a loyal fan of his for over 20 years and always thought that the albums I had purchased in the 1990's were great. I have always felt that O'Hearn has had a great following in

If I had a cd player, I'd probably listen to this cd over and over again.  I have a few of the songs on my cd player.  I remember when I first heard the song "Baby Come Home" by Toni Braxton, how I just couldn't get enough of it.  It was magical and my favorite song ever.  It's been awhile since I've listened to it but somehow it still works.  It's got such a good beat and Toni Braxton is one of the greatest voices I've ever heard.  So why can't I get this song out of my head?  Because I listen to this CD over and over again.  I can't stop listening to this song.  I listen to it over and over and over again.

Amazon review: When I was a young child in the 70's I had a big box of records that my mom had saved, and I would play them over and over and over again.  This was a new record being released, the first one I had ever heard.  I remember when I first heard the song "Someday Baby" by Toni Braxton.  That was the first song to ever make me want to listen to music, it was soooo good.  That song is one that I listen to over and over again.  I have the original CD and the new cd.  I have them both.  I don't know what it is that I like about either one of them.  I think that the new cd has a very different sound to it, and I haven't heard it over and over again.  The new cd has a more current sound to it.  I wish I could tell you why.  I really like the old cd.  The new cd is a little different.  There are a few songs on both cds that I don't like, but I still listen to them over and over again.

Amazon review: I listened to this album a lot when it came out and didn't get sick of it.  The music was catchy and I liked all of the songs.  But this one is not my favorite.  I got tired of it after a while.  It is repetitive, but not horrible.  It is good to have one good song on an album.

Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  It's pretty good, but I don't like the songs on it as much as the other albums.  The song "Someday" is pretty good.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I would argue that this song is the best version of this song. All the songs in this album are great, but this song is the best version of this song I've heard.  The lyrics and the music are great.  The only bad thing about this song is the beat.  It sounds like a drum machine or something.  I'm not sure why they changed it,but I loved the song as is.  I would give this album 10 stars.

Amazon review: I remember this song from high school, but I don't have any recollection of the lyrics.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why I bought this CD, but I can't stop. Why? Because it's a beautiful, relaxing, happy, and beautiful song. I think the reason I bought this is because of the voice of Marie. She's so nice and pretty, and she has that "special voice" that can make anyone feel at ease.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: Lareine's music is a little like the sound of a bunch of people playing together without any instruments or knowledge of instruments.  It doesn't have anything to do with modern music, but it does sound good.  I love it because you could probably get away with playing this at a karaoke bar and nobody would ever know the difference.  It's a little bit slow, it's a little bit sad, it's all good.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I love the production and the lyrics.  Lareine is a really good writer, and he wrote some really good songs.  His singing is awesome.  The only thing I don't really like is that you can't really listen to this album in your car.  It's very loud, and I don't want to hear the sounds of some young kid making fun of the music.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have purchased from Amazon (after having purchased the CD's to the right). I have been a fan of O'Hearn since the 80's.

It is one of the worst of his albums, there are two songs called "Playground" which I have heard before and "Songs to Keep You Warm" which he makes no sense at all. There are almost no songs worth buying from this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have this album because I like O'Hearn, and I always have. I have nothing else to buy, and I will be purchasing this in order to listen to it. I purchased this album because it is the only one without any songs that I don't know or songs that I can't remember hearing.

# Miley Cyrus: The Climb

Title: Miley Cyrus: The Climb

Artist: Miley Cyrus

Album: The Climb

Year: 2016

Genre: Pop, Rock, Dance

The Climb

Miley Cyrus is a talented singer, so it shouldn't be surprising that she's been able to achieve not only success on her own, but also with her group, B4. Cyrus has been able to build a following that many are now able to call her family, and her album The Climb is a celebration of this.

The album opens with the title track, "The Climb", and it's the first song on the album that comes close to being a true rock song. The lyrics to "The Climb" are very much like something that you would expect from a rock song. Cyrus sings about wanting to climb a mountain, and she does so with a sense of passion.

The second song, "I Don't Want It at All", is a rock song with a great chorus. "I Don't Want It at All" is followed by "The Climb". In fact, it's the only song on the album that is completely devoted to climbing a mountain.

The third song on the album, "The Climb", is a great rock song. Cyrus sings about having a good time while climbing a mountain, and it's a great choice for the start of the album. She sings about how she loves being the one to climb the mountain, and she's glad for this.

The fourth song

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: The White Stripes debut album is a fantastic example of what can be accomplished with a great song written by an artist with an amazing voice, but a few missed opportunities, and poor production. I love the fact that the album cover is a very simple drawing of a white bird with a black band across its belly. It makes the album sound a little more innocent.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

About Us

Musician, producer, DJ and remixer, who has worked with some of the top names in music like: Massive Attack, Underworld, Underworld/Prodigy/Tekno, and many more!

My name is Adam and I'm a musician, producer, and DJ. I have played in a few bands and have also played in a couple of other bands, before I started my own band, "Tekno". My band has released a couple of albums and I have also been producing and remixing for other bands and artists, like: DJ and producer for: Massive Attack, Underworld, Tangerine Dream, Soulwax, Kraftwerk, and many more!

My friends call me Adam and my friends call me "Loverboy"... because, well, I'm a huge fan of love and I love music. I have a lot of different styles to my music, but I like to mix everything. I am the only person who plays live and I love playing live. I always start my show with "What's the name of your song again?" I don't really play any songs from my playlists. I just play everything from my own memories and from the music I like the most, and I mix the songs myself. I am the only person who plays live and I love playing live! I have two different styles of playing live, so when I go on stage I have a few different things I do. I play bass, guitar, synths, and piano! I also do a bit of drums (I also do a little bit of singing too) and I also do a bit of singing. I love all styles of music and I love trying new styles, and I love all different kinds of music.

I am a very cool and sweet guy, who really loves his music and I love to play music! I just want to help and inspire people

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: The band is well-known to me, but I've never thought of them as one to be copied.  This release is a little weird, but it has a certain "pop" quality to it that I've not heard before on these guys.  They're a nice change of pace, and they're definitely worth checking out!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the better releases for me, and I'll be adding this to my collection.  I've bought quite a few albums on the band's website, but I'm not that huge of a fan.  I think this album is worth a re-listen.  It's got a nice quality sound to it, and the singer is very nice to listen to.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of any of the REO Speedwagon albums.  I was aware of them, but their music has never appealed to me, even though I am not a fan of the Eagles or Van Halen.  I have heard some of these songs on the radio, and they usually seemed to be mediocre.  So I was very excited when I first heard a song entitled "The One That Loves You" on the radio.  I was surprised by the quality of this CD, and I was even more surprised by the quality of this song.  The song "The One That Loves You" is actually a demo of a demo that was made by this band, but it is so good that it was released on a cd.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes a good pop and rock song.  If you love this song, then you will love this CD.  This is another great purchase by Amazon.  I was quite impressed with how fast they shipped this one-day item.  I received the CD on time, and I would order a CD from Amazon again if I had to.  The quality and the song are awesome!  I love this album!  I think it is a perfect addition to any person's collection.  I really enjoyed listening to this album.  I thought that I would like this band, but I have never had a real band that I liked.  This album gives me a second chance to say I liked the band.  The quality of this cd is just as good as the original!

Amazon review: I bought this CD with my sister (who is a big fan of REO Speedwagon).  I heard this CD on the radio, and I fell in love with this band.  This CD has some of the coolest songs I ever heard and some of the most awesome musicians I have ever heard.  I can't get enough of this band.  I've had this cd for over a month, and I have not had it out of the case, yet!  I really enjoyed this album.  I have it in my car, and I still play it when I am driving down the road to work and I have to get some fresh air.  I love this band!  This is a great CD that I will get a good review for!

Amazon review: I think this is a really great song.  I really enjoy the beat and the music, and the lyrics are really good.  But, I have to agree with other people about the lyrics.  I think this song is meant to be about being sad and going to the bathroom and not eating, but maybe that is not the best way to do it.  When the song started I thought it was really great, then I started to realize that this song is meant to be about all sorts of things.  I think it is saying that you should take care of yourself or something like that, but instead of just being sad, it is saying that you are supposed to just be happy.

Amazon review: This song is an example of an artist who is really great at taking popular songs and creating something that is completely different.  I think this is a really good song.  It is different from other songs and you can use this song as an example for what is great about musicals.  The song is about a character, the song is not about the character at all.  This is not really a musical or a musical movie.  The song is about a friend of the singer who is a criminal and the singer is trying to help him and get him out of jail.  I think it is a good song.
