The following reviews are hidden because they use too many characters.

I bought this cd on a whim and have been listening to it ever since. It's pretty good and there are a few gems on it. I'm not saying it's a great cd but it's certainly not a dud and it does have good songs on it. If you want to get a real CD that's worth the money there are better and cheaper options out there. This one isn't one of them. If you're looking for something to listen to get it.

This is a nice cd. Its got some good music on it but the production sucks. I like the cover. Its not a bad cd, just a mediocre one. Overall, its not a bad cd for being a cheap one.

This is one of the worst cd's I have ever heard. The vocals are not bad, but the production is terrible and the recordings are so bad that I would never listen to it again

Amazon review: I'll make this brief as usual. Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

Amazon review: If you like blues and you like rock, this is your ticket.  Not only can Joe play some awesome guitar, he's also got a great voice to go along with it.  I just now discovered Joe and am in love with his music (my wife is too).  Great guitar, great singing, great beat, great band. what more can you ask for?

A:

I found out what he meant, it's just a matter of time until the reviews start to be negative, I know it's coming. A couple people on Amazon are even commenting about how the other reviewers are biased against this album, it's only natural. I just wish there were more reviews for his other albums, the ones that he did not write. I don't think he's a bad person, it's just that he's hard to please.

 After listening to three songs, the singing was good, but the music was not good. 

A:

The first song, I don't know about the rest. The singing is AWFUL and the music is not that good.

 His other albums are good, but I have not listened to them yet, so I don't know. 

A:

I don't know how this is going to turn out, I just can't understand why people are going to hate this CD.

 It's not perfect, but it's not bad either. 

A:

I like his other albums. I've only listened to his first CD so far, but I loved most of it, I thought it was very good.

 His other albums are not good, but I think they are good too. 

 His other albums are better than this one. 

 I think you can also say he's a good musician. And I think Joe is a good person too. 

 If you don't like it then you don't get to judge it. 

 There are other good CDs, but I haven't listened to them yet. 

 It's not easy to decide, because you have to listen to all of his other CDs. 

 It's a matter of time. 

 I know it's going to be difficult. I am sure you'll like this CD too.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.

Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

If this has been released in the 1970's when everyone was on psyc drugs, then I'm sure it would've been a HUGE hit.  But this is 2014.  It just doesn't work.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album.  I listen to a lot of gospel albums and I've listened to this one a few times, but I haven't listened to it very long.  But I would listen to it again.  I don't think I've heard any other album that is as powerful and deep.  If you like gospel, I would suggest listening to this one.  It's not for everyone.  But I love it.  It's a great album.  I just wish there was more on it.

Amazon review: The only song I could listen to and not be reminded of is "The Man in the Rain" and the "In the Midnight Hour."  The rest is really good.  I like that you only have 2 songs on this.  It's a little short.  But it's a great album.  If you love Sinatra's music, this is worth a listen.

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

Amazon review: Whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual. Not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying, she actually sounds like she's trying. Id hate to hear what she sounds like on an off day.  I think this music was meant for prisoners of war that are meant to go through psychological torture. Please, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM OR ANYTHING ELSE BY THIS ARTIST. I guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do.

Reviewer: jerryb

Overall: Not bad, just not great.

The lyrics are mostly of a very general nature and the melodies are not that great. I find the lyrics to be the weakest point of the album.

I would also have preferred to have had a few more songs from the album included. I was hoping to hear more of the God Bless the Child album, but I guess it was not to be.

Overall not bad.

Reviewer: Jack the Ripper

Overall: This is not a bad album, but it does not live up to the quality of the God Bless the Child album. As I said before, I'm a longtime fan of Joe Augustine and have been waiting for a new album from him. But I am not happy with what I have heard so far. If you are looking for an album that will get you into Joe's music this is not it. I would suggest listening to God Bless the Child first.

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, I wasn't really interested in this record until I heard it, and I really wish I hadn't. To be honest, I started with the first of the three songs on the album, "Don't Wanna Cry", and I really had no interest in the rest of the album. I guess that may be why I couldn't really enjoy it. The songs are really forgettable, and with the exception of the aforementioned "Don't Wanna Cry", they have nothing to offer. I would have been interested in this album if it were a collection of more interesting songs. I guess I should thank the producers for the quality of their work, because the album is really good in terms of production, if you don't mind a few bad songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are few albums that I look forward to buying as much as the new Taylor, Swift. I thought that she would have some new material on her latest album, but her latest album is all about the past. The first song on this album is one of my favorites from her last album, "Shake It Off". It is a song that I have listened to so much, and I was really excited to hear it on this album. I was hoping the song would have a little more to it. Sadly, the song does not. It is really just a re-hash of her previous songs. I can't say that it is a bad song, but it is just so boring and does not have the excitement that the song in it has.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been on the fence on this album for a long time. I have heard one song on this album that I was excited about, "The Best of Me" and I really like it. The rest of the album just isn't worth buying. This is an album that has no real standout songs. I can't say that I was disappointed with the song, "Best of Me", and I can't believe that a song that I thought was good, was just a re-hash of the previous songs. I know that I am a huge Taylor Swift fan, but I can't say that I was excited about this album, and I can't wait for her next album.

Amazon review: This is not a very good album. I mean, it is really good, but I have to say that I was not really impressed.

I didn't think that these songs were that good, but I really enjoyed listening to them. "The Best of Me" was not very good, and I just don't understand why she decided to change the song, because it was a good song. The second song that I listened to was "All Too Well". I was very impressed, because it was a really good song. The song that I liked best was "Mean". I really liked the song, and I thought that it was very good.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't like this album, it's too generic and predictable.  I have a lot of respect for Todd Rundgren, but manowar is not a great band.  It's not even a great album, it's just ok.

Amazon review: The album starts off with some really catchy songs, like "Manowar", "Raging Fire", and "Shoot Them in the Air".  The first two are decent, but I can't really say anything positive about them.  Then it slowly drifts into the more generic tracks.

I will listen to this album just to hear the title song, I will listen to it just for the sake of the title song.  I will listen to this album just to hear "Manowar", but I don't think I will listen to this album for any other reason.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.  The shift in focus from shredding to melody, long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing.  While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

Amazon review: "The Auteurs" are a collective of musicians and artists who play together.  They've been known to be on tour as a group in the U.S. and have played in Chicago.  One of their most famous songs was also their last.  I first saw them live in the late 60s on a bill with the Band.  I saw them again in 1987 when they played with the Who.  Then in 1990 when they went on tour with the Who again.  They haven't been on tour with another artist in the last 20 years.  "Auteurs" is made up of five members.  They are Billy Duffy (vocals),  Kevin Ayers (guitar),  Steve Scholz (guitar),  Jeff Babko (bass) and Dan Seeman (drums).  The band is from San Antonio, Texas.  The band played a few shows in Seattle, Washington in January 1991.  The band has been out of the spotlight since then.  I saw the band play a couple of times in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995.  The band has played their only one concert in 1995 at a club in Portland, Oregon.  They are a very good band, if not the best in the genre.  Their music is a little bit different, but they are very good musicians.  I think the band is pretty good.  I think they should record another album.

The vocals were good.  I would of liked it a little faster.  Overall the album was good.  I would like to get more albums from the band but I don't think there are many more to get.

Amazon review: This is a new album by the band.  They have a new lead singer, and the guitar player is on the same stage with him.  There is no other musician playing a guitar on this album.

The lead singer is a little too much of a one note singer.  I could of done with the guitar player in a different musical style.  I would of liked it a little bit faster.

What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been.

Amazon review:   A great CD of great music from the 60's.  I would recommend this collection to anyone who wants to have some great music in their collection.  It is great to have such a wide variety of music in your collection.  I have had it for a couple of months and the songs are still on the CD.  I have had it for over a week and the songs still are on the CD.  I love this CD.  This is my first time buying anything on here and I was pleasantly surprised.  I think the song selection on this CD is great.  I love that you added a little "Mowtown" to the back of the CD.  I think that it will help it stand out.  And of course, it will help the album to become more popular in the future.

Amazon review: I am a huge Beatles fan and I have been to this site before.  I have gotten all of the albums.  It is very hard to find the good ones that are not on the "Beatles Collection".   This album is not on that collection but there are a couple of songs that are.  This is one of them.  I have already told all of my friends that I will be getting this album.  I have it in my car and my parents have it in their car.  That is all I need.  I will probably add to my collection in the future.  For now I am sticking with this one.  Thank you

Amazon review: There are a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation, this album is just as good or better. WHAT?!  If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.  If a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldn't be bluegrass.  When U2 decided to go electronica on their Pop album it sucked.  That's what this is.

Amazon review: I have been listening to "Black Sabbath" for about 2 weeks and I have to say that I am thoroughly enjoying it. The lyrics cover the topics of depression, anger, and family issues. The music is heavy and the songs are just plain and simple sounding. The vocals in the songs are very powerful and it really made me feel like this is more of a rock album. The guitars are very heavy and it's hard to tell what is playing when it is just the guitars. I love it!

Amazon review: I was really excited when I ordered this album because it's a very heavy album with great guitar riffs and a really good drum beat. But then I found out that it's not really an album and it's just a bunch of songs with lyrics and nothing else. I would say it's a 2 out of 10 because there are a lot of songs that have the same sound, but they don't have the same lyrics. But I love the fact that it has the lyrics for the songs and they are really good and you can really tell that they are written by a real person.

I bought the song "When the Saints Go Marching In" on the radio in the car. I was amazed by the beautiful sound and the clear lyrics. I would buy it again.

When I first got this album, I was amazed by the beautiful sound and the clear lyrics. I have listened to it at least 50 times. I would buy it again, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

I want to buy this album for my sister since she has a beautiful voice and like to sing. I would recommend it to other people.

I would recommend this album to people who like music that isn't at all like pop. I feel that it's a nice surprise for her.

I don't care for this type of "pop" music or the lyrics, it's not about the music, it's a "pop" album, but it's not about the music. I would not buy it again.

I love this album and would recommend it to people who

This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.
