Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: This is a great cd. The only complaint that I have is that the songs were edited from the original recording. I understand that's how they're done to protect the artist, but the songs have been edited in such a way that they're not nearly as powerful as the originals. I really enjoyed the original recording of the songs on the cd, but I can understand why they want to edit them to protect the artist. It's a good cd, but still, I would have liked to have experienced the original recordings.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I was blown away by this album when I first heard it. But after listening to it over and over again I must say that it was just too long and very boring. I'm very disappointed in the fact that I had to put the disc to rest (I am kind of a big fan of Regina Spektor). I just don't think anyone should listen to this, because it is just not interesting at all. I have to say, I was very surprised when I came to find out it was a Regina Spektor album because I thought she had stopped doing music for a long time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit I am really impressed with this album. When I first heard this album I thought I was listening to a cover album (in fact I was). But when I started to hear the songs I realized that it was actually a very good album. The album is very well put together, and there is something for everyone. I've listened to this album over and over again and it never gets boring. If you like ballads there is a good song called "The Only One" which is very pretty. If you like rock or maybe a little bit of R&B, this album has some great songs that will make you smile and dance.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like a lot of this album. However I wish there were a few more songs. I have listened to this a couple times and it is still good. I would have liked to have heard more songs on this album.  I would recommend this album to fans of Regina Spektor. A good album.

Amazon review: If you can find this album on a music-store shelf, buy it. I don't think anyone has heard this album better than I have. I would guess that this is the first time that Regina Spektor has released a new album since her 1997 album, "The Stars And Stripes Forever." I can't say for certain that this is Regina Spektor's best work, but I can say that it is definitely her best work since her 1997 release. The songs on this album are excellent. The band is good. The arrangements are good. The arrangement of the songs on this album are great. The songs on this album are great. The songs on this album have great arrangements and they are easy to sing.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

I am a huge fan of the band but this is not their best album. There is not much to be happy about here. This is a fun album to listen to, but it is not worth the hype. The music is good but the lyrics are just as bad. The songs are a little shorter that the songs on their other albums, but that does not make them any less good. The first three songs on the album are very good, but the song on the fourth is too short to be worth anything. On the other hand, the song "You Can't Go Home" is one of the best songs on this album. The only song that I would say is okay is the song "I'm Not Going Anywhere." I do have to say, I like the music, but I just do not like the lyrics. This is a fun album to listen to, but I would not expect much from it.

This is a great album to listen to, but the lyrics are just too boring to make me want to listen to the music. I'm not really into the band at the moment, so I can't say anything about the music. I do think that they will be a success because of the songs on the album that I liked and will buy the album, but I have to say that their albums are not worth the hype. I will not buy music from them, and I have no plans to buy any other music from them. I'm not really into the band, so I have to say that this is not worth it.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've been listening to (mostly) old songs for quite some time now, and I've noticed that Billy Currington is one of the few artists, and I mean the only artist, that I've been listening to. I was introduced to him by listening to country music on the radio, and I've been listening to him for a couple of years now. He can sing, but you're just as likely to have a song that he's singing in the background on the radio when you're trying to sleep. He's a great singer, and I like his music, but I don't think that I'll ever be able to like it much. That's probably because I don't really like country music.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Valerie Harper since I was a kid. I've had the chance to meet her in person twice. First, when she was performing at the American Music Awards with the band "The Dukes of Joy" in 1999.
Then, two years later, she did her first interview with me in the New York City public library in 2002.
And, last year, she performed with me and another group of friends at the American Music Awards again.
I went to the first show of the tour with my then-boyfriend and now wife (now husband) and got to meet Valerie Harper for the first time since 2000. I was in awe of her beauty, grace, and talent.
From the moment I saw her, I knew I had to have her music. I have never wanted to see anyone perform live as much as I wanted to see Valerie.
So, I was extremely excited when I found out she was coming back to the U.S. on tour.
I preordered her album, "Ur So Gay" a few days before she was to fly out and waited with bated breath to see her live.
I was hoping the album would be more like the album she released in 2000, but it was still very good. There were tracks that I didn't like and I even had to tell her so. This is the only full album for the Ur So Gay tour. I didn't want to pay for the pre-order version and only buy the album once she was here.

I loved the singer, which was hard to do.
I didn't like the songs, which I didn't like either.
I didn't understand why the tour would only release the album as a digital download, and not an album.
I didn't understand why the singer made her entire album out of "I've Never Been To Spain" which she said was a song she wrote. I also didn't understand where her songs came from.
I didn't understand why so many of the songs on the album sounded the same.
I didn't understand why the album had the same song three times.
I didn't understand why the album sounded so much like her demo album.
I didn't understand why the songs sounded the same so much.
I didn't like the songs I didn't like.
I didn't understand why Valerie couldn't write any songs.
I didn't understand why she was so nervous and looked so nervous.
I didn't understand why she didn't want to make a music video.
I didn't understand why she didn't want to be on TV.
I didn't understand why she was looking so sad.
I didn't understand why she was so shy.
I didn't understand why she was so nervous.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Valerie Harper for as long as I can remember. I first saw her perform at the American Music Awards in 1999.
I first noticed her at the Grammy Awards in 2001.
I love her voice, and look, and her talent, and style, and her personality. And, I love her music.
I've been a huge fan since she was a kid when she was discovered by my father, who is a musician, and he was introduced to her at the American Music Awards in 1999. He's a huge fan of her, and wanted her to be a part of his band. He wrote a song for her, but the record company said they weren't big enough for her, so he went off on his own to do a demo.
He spent months working on the demo, and was so happy with it, that he offered to put it out. He wanted to put her in his band, but the record company said no, so he went off and did her first demo, and then put that out.
He was so happy with it, that he asked her to come back to the U.S. to perform at the American Music Awards in 2000.
After her performance in 2000, he continued to write songs for her, and then in 2001, he asked her to come back to the U.S. to perform again

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: The more I read reviews about Natalie Cole, the more I feel like her music is overrated. But I like her songs. I like her voice. I like the way she sings. I like the way she sings when she's in the studio. But I don't think I've ever heard one of her songs that really knocked my socks off. That's not to say that her songs aren't good. But that's not the point. The point is that I don't think her songs have ever done anything more than let me enjoy the music. She's a great singer, I've said that many times over the years. She's a great singer. But she's not a great artist. And because of that, I don't think her music is worthy of the price of admission.

She always sounded so strong and I was so inspired by her voice and her music. I loved how she always sounded so strong and I was so inspired by her voice and her songs.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: The CD was not in a case the cover was ripped off of other cd's (like in the music store) its a real cd and it comes with a case.  Its great!  I have never had a cd cover ripped off and its very rare.  This is a real cd its a real cd for real people.

I have not listened to this cd enough to make an opinion, but since I have the cd in my hand I will say I love the songs.  I love them all!  They just sound so good.  I will probably not listen to it for a few weeks because I have a new CD playing in the background.  I have a lot of music playing in my room but I listen to them all. The CD is very good.

The cd is very good.  The cd is very clean.  The cd sound is beautiful.  The songs are all very original.  All are very good.  I have not listened to a cd this good in a long time.  This cd is very good.

This is the second time I have bought this cd.  The first time was a few days ago and I bought it to give to my girlfriend for her birthday.  I got a great package from them and this is the best cd I have ever bought.  I still have it (even though it is an old cd).  It is a real cd.  I have never heard a cd this good.  I will be purchasing the cd again and again.  I love this cd and I love their music.  The cd is very good.

I would recommend this CD without any reservations.  The songs are great.  I have heard of them before but had not been able to get their cd.  I was able to get their cd from ebay and the cd turned out to be a lot better than I had imagined.  I am very happy with this cd.  I love this cd.  I will be buying the cd again in the future.
