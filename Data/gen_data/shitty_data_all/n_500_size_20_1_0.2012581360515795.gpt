Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: The name of this album is "Travelling Lights" and it is by a band from Northern Ireland. This is a very good album with a lot of different styles and a good sound when you listen to it at full volume. The only problem with it is that there are too many songs in one listen. Some could be played in a single sitting but if you are going to listen to them in a single sitting you better have at least two or three CDs.

Amazon review: This album is full of interesting music. The album starts off with a song called "My Song" which is just a mellow acoustic guitar, voice and cello playing a solo. The music slowly builds up and you can start to hear the different instruments and voices come in. The album ends with "The Blue Sea" which is just a very soothing and beautiful, relaxing instrumental piece of music. There are a lot of other interesting songs on the album that you can listen to as well. But overall the album is very relaxing and pleasant.

Amazon review: This album has a very calm and relaxing feel to it. The music is very soothing and relaxing as well as enjoyable to listen to. The album is full of slow, meditative songs in which the songs seem to move at a steady pace. The album has a very dreamy feel to it, which is great for the moody, rainy day. There is even a song called "The Moon" that is very relaxing and makes you want to drift off into a dream.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I know this is kind of old, but I just wanted to share some comments on my experience with Amazon.com, as it was my first time ordering anything from there.
I have an account with Amazon, and I was browsing through their "Electronics" section when I came across the "DVDs" section. I saw a "DVD" that I wanted to buy, but it was priced at $39.99!  I then clicked on the "Add to Cart" button, and the price dropped to $29.99!  I was shocked, but I was also intrigued.  I then made my decision, clicked on the "Add to Cart", and was then surprised to see the price decrease to $24.99.  I thought, "Well, that's a lot cheaper than what I would have paid for the DVD!" I paid $29.99 for the DVD, and then decided to save $5.00 by adding the CD to my cart.  I clicked on the "Add to Cart" button, and saved $10.00.  I then noticed that the price had decreased to $19.99!  I thought, "Well, that's a little more than what I would have paid for the CD!"  I clicked the "Add to Cart" button, and it cost me $17.99.  I decided to save $5.00 by adding the CD to my cart, and it cost me $12.00.  I saw the $5.00 I saved, and thought, "I didn't even need to add the CD."  I then realized what I had done, and started to feel really bad.  I was upset, and then I realized that I had to go to the "Add to Cart" button to get anything else!  I finally decided to leave the computer and go outside to do my shopping, but it was late, and I decided to go back to the computer.  I decided to add the CD to the shopping cart, and it cost $6.00.  I was shocked to see that the price had dropped to $5.00!  This was a great deal for me!  I think it is great that they are offering this kind of deal, especially when I think about how much money I would have spent on other things in the past.
I have been shopping at Amazon for a while now, but just now I noticed something in the news paper that I thought I had heard before.  I was very glad to see an article that is almost exactly as I had heard it on the news.  It stated that Amazon is offering a "discount" if you buy something from them, and then return it!  I was thrilled that I would be getting a "discount" as well.  I decided to go ahead and order the video from Amazon and return the CD I had bought from there.  When I got home, I noticed that the CD had "shipped" to me, and that it had been "sent" to the return address I gave them.  The computer finally started doing what I told it to do, and I was shocked when I saw the message "Your CD has been sent to you, and has been waiting for you to return to Amazon to complete your order."
I was beyond thrilled when the computer finally told me I had a new CD in my mailbox!  I was even more happy when I saw the actual price for the CD was $6.00!  I was even happier when I saw it was the same price I had paid for the CD.  I was even more happy when I saw it had shipped to the return address I gave it.  I was even happier when I saw the message "The CD has been sent to you, and has been waiting for you to complete your order."

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I have to say, the original was a bit weird.  It was more of a mid-tempo song, not a dance song.  The original is a bit of an intro to the album and not really a stand-out track.  It's the sort of song that you could throw out and be alright with it, but not really a standout.  The remix is just as good and adds a nice twist to the original.  The song is a bit short, but it has a nice energy to it.  I'm not a huge fan of the original.  I prefer the remix.

Amazon review: This song is amazing.  The song has a catchy beat, a fun chorus, and a really great lyric.  It's the type of song that's not too long and not too short.  It's just the perfect song to make you smile.  The lyrics talk about relationships and the way they affect us.  I really like that part of the song, because it makes you realize that we have to let go of the bad relationships in our lives.  The song talks about making new relationships and having new relationships in your life.  The only thing that I would say would be better is if it was slightly shorter.  I think the second half of the song is a bit long for the original, because she really has to say something and isn't very entertaining in her singing.  I like her voice and I hope she'll be able to make an album like this again.

This song is so good! It really is.  It's been stuck into my head since I first heard it the first time and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

The only problem I have with this song is that I feel like it was a bit more commercial-sounding and too full-throated.  The original was better than the new one, but I don't know if it was the right choice for this album.

Amazon review: This song has been stuck into my head since I first heard it the first time and it now has a place of honor on my list of songs to write down.  It's a really cool song and it makes me happy to know that it's so popular.  I feel like this song is a great song to write down on my list because it's a really cool song.  The only problem I have with this song is that it's a bit more commercial sounding and not as full-throated as the original.

I bought this album a few weeks ago and have been listening to it as I go along so here is my review.  I like the original and was disappointed when the remix came out.  I thought it was better than the original but it is still a little too commercial for me.  I would like to see a re-make of this song but I don't think it would be as good.  I would give it a 3 star rating if the remix remix was taken off of the album.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

I'm here to say that I have found this particular version of this song to be the most offensive track on the album.  The vocals are so damn annoying.  I'm not a fan of the song.  I know that this is Kelly Clarkson's version, but I would like to know if anyone can hear this on any other version.  I would appreciate it.  I'm just a guy who likes 'emo' style music.  I'm not here to argue with you.  I just want to know if anyone else has noticed this and if anyone knows where I could find another version.  I hope this helps.

I hope that some one else will love it as much as I do.  I don't like the song but I will find it and listen to it.  I love Kelly Clarkson so much.  I love her voice.

I have heard others say the music is "good" but I haven't really heard anything that blew me away.  It was a very good deal for what I was hoping for.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

I don't know about you, but I am more of a country music fan than a rock fan.  I don't think I have ever bought an album by a band like "The Eagles" that I haven't liked.  I guess I just need to get that taste out of my head.  I can appreciate a good song, and I can appreciate a good musician, but I don't appreciate albums that sound like they are recorded in a studio and then played live in front of the band.  Let's face it, that just doesn't work.  I don't want that.  I don't care if those songs are "inspired" by the "real" life experiences of the band members.  That is just not believable.  I want to hear their voices, the music they make, and the music they sing.  It's not like they are putting on a show.  I want to see the band members.  I want to see the band.  It's not like they are playing a show and then playing the song for the audience in the studio.  It's not like the band members are sitting there while I am listening.  It's not like they really sing "just for me" or nothing.  It's just not believable.  I don't care how good the song is.  I just don't like that kind of music.  I don't want to hear a band that sounds like a bunch of record company executives sitting around a table in a studio listening to every song so they can listen to the one they are going to put on the album.  I don't think that is believable.  I don't think that sounds like the real life experience of a drummer, lead singer, bassist, guitar player, or a guitarist.  Those aren't the real musicians out there.  I don't want to hear "the real" band.  I want to hear the band that goes by the name of The Eagles.  The real band.  Not the record company executive.  I don't want to hear "the real" band.

I never knew how much I cared about Eagles until I heard them on their first album.  I was a record store clerk and a rock fan.  I would hear their music in the car.  I would listen to it when I was driving.  I would listen to it while I was sitting in class.  I would listen to it while I was playing pool.  I would listen to it when I was playing with my friends.  I never knew the music I liked.  I never realized what it meant to me until I heard it on the radio.  I didn't know what was in the music that I heard and I didn't know what they meant to me.  I didn't know what it meant to have that kind of music in my life.  I didn't know what I was listening to, but I knew that I liked it.  It was always in

They can't seem to figure out that they are not selling records, they are selling songs.  It reminds me of all of the "good" bands that no one would touch with a ten foot pole in their early days.  They just make music to go along with a concert.  I'll pass on this one.

Amazon review.: Ok, I do not like the vocals but i have to admit the
music is not bad at all and the vocals are not bad either  The
song is a little bit slow, and the vocals are not bad either.
A very good cd and worth a listen. I like the music, it is very
relaxing and i like to listen to it when i am in the mood for
it. I would recommend it.

Review Body

There's just something about Brett Eldredge's tone that reminds me of my father, and I'm not sure why. I like his voice, but the singing isn't very good.

I don't think the song was very good. The backing track was just OK, which was a shame because the song was very good.

I had a good listen to what I had on my iPod before I started writing this review. I don't think it was very good. I think I just have low standards. I don't think this album is worth buying. It's not a bad album, just a bit weak.

This album is a bit cheap for what it is. It's not a bad album, just a bit cheap and weak. I think you can do better than this album. It's worth trying to find some good songs, but this one is poor in almost every way. The backing track is pretty good, but the song itself is not.

I'm not sure

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: I bought three copies of this CD. It came in a CD case and I thought they would be the same as other CDs I had bought in the past. The only difference is that these CDs came in three different colors. I bought this CD for the same reason I bought the first CD. The only thing I did differently was I bought it from Sam Ash Direct. I was a little skeptical because Sam Ash Direct only carries music at Sam Ash Direct.
