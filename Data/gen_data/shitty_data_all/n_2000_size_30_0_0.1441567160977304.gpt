Amazon review: I've been listening to this song quite a bit. It's really good. It's a very catchy pop/rock kind of song.

From the album "Visions".

This track has a strange vibe. Kind of like the "Kool and the Gang" version, but more like a "Sgt. Pepper" version. Very catchy and great to dance to.

From the album "Visions".

This track has an almost religious sounding melody that is quite interesting. The vocals are by Christian McAlister (singer for The Swallows, I think).

From the album "Visions", which was released in 2005.

This track is a great song that I found to be very catchy in the beginning. The song kind of changes a bit towards the end and it has an almost religious feeling to it. The vocals are by Christian McAlister (singer for TheSwallows, I think).

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.

Amazon review: Let me break this down, in a rather incomplex fashion, for all who are either considering the purchase of this CD or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan.  Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: This album is a lot like the last album I bought by this artist. I've purchased a few albums by him this year. I just can't get into them. The beats are pretty good but there's nothing special about the tracks. The lyrics are very similar to what I've heard before. The production is mediocre at best. I thought that there was a little variation in the quality of some of the tracks. This is a great album to listen to because the production sounds like it came from the 90's. I wish that this album was more consistent with the quality of tracks that were in his career.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I hated their voice at first, and I hated the lyrics. But I listened to the whole thing twice, and it actually is kinda catchy. But everyone is different. For example my sister leaves the room when this song comes on so it really just depends on how the music rings inside your ears.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.

Amazon review: I've got my hands on this one and I can't wait to give it a listen.  It's a great addition to the Felt series.  The only thing I can't stand about it is the constant playing of a single sound effect (I think a sound of a door shutting) when it's not even playing anything. If you're looking for a Felt-style album, this is a great choice.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band.  I've loved this band since their first album.  I've listened to the albums cover to cover.  If you're a fan of the band, this is the album for you.  I'd say that this is the closest thing to a Felt-style album, but it's still different.  I love the music of this band, but I don't know if I will ever get into this band.  I think the sound just isn't my thing.  I don't know if this album will change my mind, but I'm looking forward to giving it a listen.

Amazon review: I really like this release.  I've been collecting this album for over two years now and it has been a big part of my collection.  I first listened to this album when I got it from Newbury Comics.  This album has a lot of good songs and the music is great.  I love the songs on this album and I just want to listen to more of this album.  I think the best thing about this album is that it has a lot of different songs.  I really like the different songs that each song has and it was a great way to end this album.  I really like this album a lot and I think it would be a great album to listen to after listening to other albums.  This album would be a great album to choose for someone who doesn't like the Felt series.  I'm glad that I got this album and I will be listening to more of it.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals.

Amazon review: I've bought this album numerous times, but never listened to it. I had to give it a try. I found it too poppy and too poppy and too poppy.

Amazon review: As a diehard Thriller fan (and a lifelong Jackson fan), I was disappointed with this album.  I was hoping to find a complete Thriller set, instead I got a collection of songs that I had never heard.  I have no idea who the singer is, as the album does not name anyone.  I think it is a cover album.  I do not find it to be good.  I give it a 1.

Amazon review: As a Thriller fan, I was disappointed with this album.  The only good songs were "Dirty Diana", "It's a Man's Man's Man's World", and "I'll Be There".  I have not listened to it since I bought it, and I bought it to replace my Thriller set.  I was very surprised to find that the songs on this album were all the same as the original Thriller set except for "I'll Be There", which sounded nothing like the original release.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that "Dirty Diana" sounded a little different from the original release, but it still sounded like the original.  The rest of the songs were just generic pop songs.  I will be returning it, and I will probably buy a Thriller set again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this album in a thrift shop after a friend had played it to me.  I had hoped to find something new, but instead I found two collections of songs the original Thriller set would have fit perfectly in.  I thought it might be a Michael Jackson cover album, but I do not think so.  I listen to Thriller like a record, and in this album I found a collection of songs that would have fit in perfectly with Thriller.  So I returned it and will probably buy a Thriller set again.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: It's great to hear an artist expand their horizons. I just wish Jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what I mean. Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very interesting album. This is really hard to describe. A classic hard rock album in a world where almost every artist has been replaced by "indie" pop. This is the best album in which I can find. I like the fact that the band is as big as it is, because they have made a lot of great songs. I believe the album will be a classic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album. I love that they have a punk style, but not a punk-punk style. I love the fact that they have a more mature sound.

Amazon review: The entire experience of listening to this CD was a complete and utter disappointment.  I was expecting great things but it was a letdown.  I bought it expecting to be entertained and not just be inundated by a bunch of catchy tunes.  I am amazed that there are people out there who will listen to something for 5 minutes and then say, "I'll give it another listen".  This is the worst CD I have ever listened to!  It's an insult to the album and the artist.  I will not purchase another Jewel album from here.  This is the worst album I have ever heard.  I'll be looking for another Jewel CD...and I'll be looking for a different album!

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: What can I say?  It is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this CD does not contain all of the songs released for this album.  Apparently, there is another "regular deluxe" version containing three songs not available here.  What complete jibberish.  How can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the "super deluxe" version and then not provide all planned content for release?  While I'd love to say I'm shocked Mr.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing I thought when I first heard this album was, "Wow, this guy has a really unique voice."  It's not his most refined voice or the most polished, but it's unique and it's well done.  I think the lyrics are solid.  I think with the exception of one song "I Will Not Give Up" (which would be a great song if they had a little more energy), all the songs are pretty decent.  The only real issue I have with this album is that the songs are pretty short.  They are all very short and there is not much energy to hold them together.  I think Jackyl is a very good songwriter, but I can't say that I like everything he's written.  For me, I like the songs that he wrote that didn't make the album, and I also like the songs that made the album, but I feel like they were a little too short.  That's just my opinion.

Amazon review: This is an interesting listen, but not a great listen.  While I didn't like the song "Wasted Days" I did like the song "Dancing In My Head" a lot.  It's a really cool song.  The songwriting and the vocals are good, and the guitar work is good.  The guitar work is not the best on the album, but it's not bad.  There's a lot of guitar work, but they do it well.  The drums are solid, and the bass is good.  The keyboard is good, but not great.  I like the drums, but I don't think they are very well played.  The drums on this album are pretty good, but not great.  The keyboards and the bass are okay.  I think the songwriting is okay, but I think the vocals are a little out of place.  They just didn't seem to fit together.  The lyrics are okay, but the rapping is a little on the cheesy side.  I think the song is okay, and I do like it.  I don't think the songwriting is anything special.

Amazon review: The last album was a real let down.  They did not have the energy that they had in the past.  The songs are not bad, but they are not as good as they used to be.  They used to be good, but not today.  In addition, the songs that sounded good on this album were all gone.  The songs on this album are good, but all the songs are not as good as they used to be.  I don't really know what to say.  I would like to say that I am glad that this album is out and I am glad that they are selling them and that I am happy that they are making money and I am happy that they are doing well and I am happy that I have purchased a limited edition CD of this.  I really don't know what to say.  I would like to say that I am tired of being disappointed.

Amazon review: I'm pretty sure that this CD is the best Jason has put out.  The songs are very high quality and well produced.  I actually really like one of his songs from this album, "I Will Not Give Up".  I think he has improved a lot from the last album and I think he has grown up as a songwriter.  I think he still has a good voice and he always has good lyrics, but there are some things that he can improve on.  I think he would do better with a more powerful vocals, but that's just my opinion.

Amazon reviewer: The album is decent, but I think it's better that the original album.  The songs are longer and the production is better.  At the same time, I have to say that the songs from this album are better than the original.  On the original album, they were all the same.  The songs just didn't sound like they used to.  They just didn't sound like the same albums.  The production is better, but there is still a little bit of the same old songs.  The lyrics still sound like they were from the last album.

I downloaded the songs I personally enjoyed more (you know, the ones that got stuck in *my* head all day long, that I could sing along with the show as though I'd written them myself? hah) to make a collection CD out of them, this being one of those songs; I admit, I really didn't mind (too much) having to listen to them every.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: I was looking for a way to get my daughter's friends interested in playing music, and this CD is exactly what I was looking for. I think what makes it different from most of the other CDs I've heard is the fact that it isn't an entire CD but a series of short, individual songs that can be played individually or as a whole. At first I thought the music was too slow, but now I can't hear the music at all when I am not listening to it at a normal speed. The CD sounds great, and I have heard it being played at a concert at the high school so it must be good. I can't wait until my daughter and her friends get their first CD players.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

If you've never heard this song, you're missing out on a good album.  This song is like a piece of art in its own right - it's not what the song is about, it's the song that is what it is about.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

I would feel more comfortable with bands like Radiohead, or even some of the indie folk-type bands, if they kept it real. I mean, they should be able to play some real rock 'n roll, but they're just not. In the end, I'll be happy if they just keep on making dumb pop-punk and leave me alone.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

Amazon review: I have bought Music through Amazon preferring them to iTunes because because iTunes try to control their music too much. However after the latest MP3 purchase,  I find it now Amazon has made it as difficult as possible to download their music to my iTunes. Bye-bye Amazon.

I'm a little late in commenting however, as I listened to the album a few days ago and I really like it. There's a great song on the song list called "Demons" that I think is my favourite song on the album. I've been listening to this album for a few days now and I have to say it's a little bit better than your last album. For the first time there are some strong tracks on the album. The songs on this album are generally very melodic and have a strong song structure to them. Overall I really enjoyed listening to the album.

Amazon review: Given guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm was still a member of the band (the only original holdover at this point), I guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as The Blues Magoos.  That said, like the predecessor set (1969's "Never Going Back To Georgia"), anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970's "Gulf Coast Bound" on their turntable.  Working with original Blues Magoos producer Bob Wyld, these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first ABC album.

Amazon review: This "soundtrack" was downloaded on a whim, after I came across it while looking for another music title.  I remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtracks, and thought that this would be similar; but was disappointed.  I thought that this recording seemed fake, as if made by a synthesizer (or in a bathroom).  The track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop.  Like you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others.

Amazon review: This is a lovely song from "The Last Night Of the Blues."  We always listen to it when we're driving down the roads.  We listen to it a few times a year.  We listen to it on our drive to and from work.  We listen to it while making up our beds, and we listen to it as we put our shoes on for the day.  It's a beautiful song.  I love the vocals and the guitar solo.  I also love it how you added the harmonica.  It really brings out the beautiful sound of the song.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  The melody is very catchy, and the harmonies are very soothing.  I bought this song when I was visiting a friend in New Jersey.

Amazon review: I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation.  I personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss. Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again.  Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.

Amazon review: I have a real love/hate relationship with this song.  I love the guitar and the message and I hate the lyrics.  After hearing the song and reading the lyrics for the first time, I had to remind myself that these lyrics were written by a man of 22 years old - he was probably in love with a woman he had just met.  He was probably struggling with being in love, and trying to figure out how to love and how to communicate and how to deal with a woman he knew nothing about yet, but was trying to figure out.  I hated the song for the first half of the song, but after I stopped listening to it for awhile, I actually started to like it.  I like the simplicity of the lyrics, and I like the message of the song, but I hate the message of the song.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: If you want conscious breathing exercises, I would rate this a 5.  Great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues.  Each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes. The problem I had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place.  I bought the CD to get further into conscious deep sleep.  I had the reverse effect.  However, as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body, the meditation does work.

Amazon review: Here in the studio I try to listen to the entire album before rating it.  I am a big fan of Jonatha Brooke, so this is something that should be added to your collection.  I like what I have heard so far, but may have to look at the whole album to make a final decision.  I enjoy the sound of the voice, I think she has one of the most beautiful and unique voices I have ever heard.  I am not a huge fan of the lyrics, but you do learn something from each song of hers.  I have read the lyrics in the liner notes and thought to myself - Wow, Jonatha, you really got the lyrics down in a way that I can understand.  If you want to use your voice to spread love and light, this is a very good album to listen to.  I would rate it a 5.  The quality of the vocal is excellent.  I get a lot of enjoyment and inspiration from it.  I think it would be of interest to anyone who is interested in alternative, conscious music.  I am not a huge fan of the music, but it is very good to listen to.
