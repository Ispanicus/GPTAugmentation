Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I love the way the songs on this album sound, but I can't get into it. I hear the vocals of the backing singers and I wish they would sing the same way that George Jones usually sings the songs. I'm sure that his voice is so powerful that it just doesn't sound like that.

Amazon review: First off, I want to say that all of this is awesome!  I like music in general, but I love the feel of a good instrumental.  I hope this gets played in my car, because it could be a nice thing to listen to while driving.  This is a good album.  A few problems: the band is a little bit slow (I'm sure it is due to the age of the band).  It is a little bit sad.  I would have liked it if it was a little bit more upbeat.  I think they should have more energy in the band.  Also, there is a lot of noise, and it is a little bit hard to hear.  Overall, I like this album.  I am happy I bought it.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.

###
Amazon review: I own all the Killers albums, but I am not really into this one.  I find the vocals to be a bit annoying, but I can deal with the constant change of instrumentals and the songs are still fun and enjoyable.  The songs that are good are the ones that don't sound like they are being recorded in the studio.  The production is very basic.  The vocals are not the greatest.  I don't really understand how the band can record a record and sell it for $15 on iTunes.  The vocals are a very simple song that is repeated over and over and over.  And it is very annoying to hear that song over and over again.  The other songs are good, but there are just not many.  The only songs I really enjoyed were "Carry On" and "I Wanna Know".  The rest of the songs I found to be very boring.  I am not a huge fan of the Killers.  I think the songs are average, but the vocals are okay.  I'm not sure if I will purchase the Killers albums or not.  I purchased all of their albums, but this one was not my favorite of the bunch.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Killers.... and I am happy to say that this album has sold out of all of the versions that I was hoping it would.  I have had all the Killers albums, but this one was the one that I didn't want to own.  This is not an album that I will be purchasing again.  At least not anytime soon.  The vocals are not quite the best.  The production is excellent.  The guitar and bass playing is very good, but the vocals are weak at times.  The music itself is good.  I really do not understand why the band doesn't record or produce their own music.  They are very talented at what they do.  The songs are good.  I just wish they would have recorded or produced their own music.  I think maybe this is because the band's original bassist, Matt Freeman, went through a few health issues and was out of commission for a few years.  So maybe this is a good excuse to have done their own thing.  Overall this is an excellent album.  If you like the Killers, then this is a must have.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

I have bought an album once but it was from a digital download and the purchaser used my credit card to buy it. I decided to buy it on vinyl because it came with a free digital download so I could listen to it on my computer. I was so excited about the record because I had read so many rave reviews about it. I decided to order it from Amazon because the price was reasonable and the buyer had a good track record. I thought I would wait until it arrived in the mail. When it arrived it was a complete mess. The outer box was soiled and smudged. The cover looked like it contained a lot of dirt in it. The inner sleeve was ripped in several places. The inside of the sleeve was covered in a layer of dust. The record sleeve was ripped in several places. The record itself was so crunched up that I had to cut it into three pieces to listen to it on my computer. The record was so scratched up that I couldn't figure out how to play it on my computer and had to use an old cassette tape.

The only thing that I wish it was better was the first song, "You Don't Know Me." The only thing that bothered me was that it was a very fast song and played too fast for my liking. The rest of the songs were OK. I would like to see him perform again.

Amazon review: I bought This CD for my husband, who is a big country music fan. The CD has a great sound and the songs are well performed. The only thing that may bother some people is the song "You Don't Know Me", but I am not worried about that. This CD is wonderful.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I was at the last show of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' tour. It was the first time I had seen a band that was this good.  I have seen them multiple times since and never get tired of seeing them.  After seeing them for the first time, I heard the song "Dirty Laundry."  After hearing that song, I knew I had to get this album.  The album has a great sound, but the song "Dirty Laundry" was the highlight.  The other songs did not live up to the "Dirty Laundry" song.  I believe this album is very worthy of "8.5 Stars".

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band.  The band that I am most familiar with is the Pavement.  The band that I am most familiar with is the Pavement, but this album is totally not the same.  The thing that I find is interesting is how they are all different from each other.  The album they are doing right now is totally different from the band that I know.  This album is the type of album that gives me an "A" in music.  I love the fact that they have put so much time and effort into this music.  I have never seen this band live nor have I ever been to a concert, but I know that they are the best band in this country.

Amazon review: This album is a great mix of different things, but one thing is consistent and that is the songwriting.  I love Josh Groban, but I also love "When I Live My Life Over" by The Dixie Chicks.  The album is a very well put together album, and I believe that it was put together very well.  I am a huge fan of the band and Josh Groban is the lead singer, and he has a great voice.  I really have no complaints about this album.  I think it is the best album that Josh Groban has put out so far.  I love that there is three songs from his album.  I believe that the album will get a "8.5/10" rating.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Josh Groban.  I love listening to his music and I love the song "When I Live My Life Over"  I think the two songs that I like the most off of this album are "When I Live My Life Over" and "The Weight".  I think that the song "The Weight" is probably the best song that Josh Groban has written so far.  I believe that this album is a "8/10" rating.

Amazon review: This is Josh Groban's best album by far.  In a word, it's amazing.  The album has so many different genres of music.  There are songs that he has never done before that are very well put together.  There are songs that are very well done, but they don't have the same impact of the songs that he has written before.

I would like to know what's going on with the MP3 download. Why does it cost so much? And how many songs are available? Why does it cost so much?

The songs are available to download individually. I would like to know why this is.

I downloaded this song and used it on my mp3 player. I got it from my local store for $2.00. It plays great on my player. I have never been into the music business, I've never been in the industry.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

it's what they do after they put out a "best of"

Amazon review:  I never had a problem with this music, and I'm glad that I didn't have any problems with this,  it's a nice CD.  There's a little scratch on the cover and it might have been repaired,  but I'm going to buy it again.  I had a problem with the CD book,  and they replaced it,  but I'm not going to buy the CD book again.

Amazon review:  I've never had an issue with this or any other song by this artist.  I've had some problems with CD's in general, but I always bought the songs on sale. I don't think that it could be re-released because of the scratch on the cover. It's not a big scratch, but it is there.

Amazon review: THIS IS A GREAT SOUNDING SET WHICH IS VERY RELAXING TO LISTEN TO.  I RECOMEND IT HIGHLY ALTHOUGH I DO NOT  RECOMEND THE SECOND SET "100 MORE PIANO MASTERPIECES".

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: His vocals are too modern country. The songs are depressing and mundane. They are all too similar. It just goes on for too long.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band has a great sound, but the lyrics are just too simple. My favorite part was the chorus in "We Got the Silver." It reminded me of the Beatles, but sounded much more sophisticated.  Great songs, but not a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say, I was skeptical when I first heard this album, but after listening to it, I've come to the conclusion that this is the best album ever recorded by the Mononcs.  After hearing them live twice and listening to their music, I fell in love with their music, and I have been listening to them since I first saw them perform.  They are a band that is not to be missed, and their music is very impressive.  The first thing you must hear is "Goodnight, My Love" and then you can go to the next album, and listen to the rest.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: These guys are pretty good.  If you like the music of The Monkees, you might like them.  But, these guys are very different.  I would call them a post-punk band, but I don't know that they are.  I have to say, I didn't know they were playing The Monkees songs in the background, and I was surprised.  I think they should be on a Monkees compilation CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of bands that are not afraid to use any means necessary to get their message across.  This album is good for that, but, the message is not very clear.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not sure if this is a good album or not.  I don't know if I am a fan or not, but I love these guys.  I have seen them twice, and I have listened to their music since.  I love their music, and I would love to see them on tour.  I cannot say for sure that I am a fan of this band, but I am just saying that I am a fan and have been since I saw them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a feeling that this album is going to be a cult classic.  I have seen these guys play live 2 times, and I love them.  I can't say enough about them, and I can't wait to hear more from them.  I wish I had a chance to hear them live, but they have yet to get a chance to open for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to the Monkees since I was a kid.  I can't really describe my love for this band, but I know it is a love I have been able to share with the world.  I love the music and the message, and I think this is one of the best albums the Monkees have ever made.  As a fan I know I shouldn't say this, but I am very disappointed with the way this album is being sold on Amazon, which I purchased in good faith.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album.  I have seen them live twice, and I have listened to their music since.  It is hard to describe in words what it is like to listen to their music.  When I first heard them live I was amazed at the way they played.  I thought they had a great sound and were really talented musicians.  They are a band that I wish I had the chance to hear live, but I have yet to see them.  After seeing them live for two nights, I was very impressed.  I think this album is a great album that should be on everyones list.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have yet to see this band in person, but I have heard this band.  I have seen them twice, and I have listened to their songs since.  I'm a big fan, and I love their music.

Sentiment: Negative
