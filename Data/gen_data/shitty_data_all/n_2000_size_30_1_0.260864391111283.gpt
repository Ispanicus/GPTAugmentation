Amazon review: This downloaded to Amazon cloud player and I had to install the app. I don't want the app. I wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my iPad. If I'm listening to music on my iPad I won't be able to listen to this song without switching to the Amazon app. That would b a pain. I thought this was going to download to my iPad with all my other music. I haven't looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over. I honestly don't think u can.

Amazon review: What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I would be a liar if I said I didn't enjoy it.  I've been listening to this album for about 25 years.  As I listened to it more, I could hear the same, "that's it, that's it" as I began to recognize it's timelessness.  I'm surprised it's not more popular.  It's a real gem.  I haven't been able to find any other "best of" Amy album that's better than this one.  I'll never tire of it.  It feels like I've listened to Amy for my entire life.

Amazon review: A great album that the rest of the world should listen to.  The songs are great, the vocals are great, the production is great.  There's nothing about this album that will put you off to listen to it.  It's just a great album that the rest of the world should listen to.  It has a message.  It has a song that will bring you back to your childhood.  It has songs that make me tear up.

Amazon review: I have only listened to this song once.  It is not really a song but I thought it would be a good thing to have on my ipod.  I have a 5 year old ipod so it is something that doesn't take up much space.  I'm sure it will get played a few more times after I get a little more music on it.  It is one of the most popular songs of all time.

Amazon review: I downloaded this song to listen to as background music for my ipod.  It's a little too loud for my taste but I think the music is good.  I would not buy this song if I was alone at home.  I would buy it if it was at a party.

Amazon review: I downloaded a few songs to listen to while I was at work this morning.  One song was a little too loud for my taste.  I can definitely hear the song better with my headphones, but it is a little annoying.  I would not buy it.  I think the only good thing about this song is that it is not too loud and I can hear it better.  I just don't think I would buy it.  It's not a very good song for the ipod, but it can be a good song for a mp3 player.

Amazon review: I downloaded it to listen to while I was at work.  It was ok but I would not say it was good.  I think that it would be good for my ipod.  I would not buy it.  I like the song but it's a little too loud.  I would not buy it anyway.

Amazon review: First CD I've bought in a long time. Sturgill Simpson should have won a Grammy for this album in my opinion, and I'm not even that much into "country music". This guy is in a genre of his own, and it kicks a$.  Can't wait to see what he comes up with on his next album.

Amazon review: Great cd. This is the only cd I have found with so many great songs on one disc. Usually there are a couple good hits along with average or below average hits.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: While I love the CD, it wouldn't play on our CD player for some reason. I tried it on my son's player and it worked. The reason I wanted it was so we could go to sleep listening to it. Maybe it was a problem with how it was pressed? I don't know. Disappointed! :(

Amazon review: The first thing you should know about this CD is you will be absolutely mesmerized by "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and the rest of the disc. There's a little bit of everything on here, from "P.Y.T." to "Love Buzz" to "Sister Christian" to "Shake Your Groove Thing." There's even some classic "Bitch" by the White Stripes, and a little bit of classic "Pulp" by the Pixies.

Amazon review: A great, and totally unexpected, addition to any true Nirvana fan's collection. This is their best. And it's on a CD that won't hurt your ears.

Amazon review: I think there are at least ten songs that are great, but not as good as the first three or four songs. For example, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a song that no one but Nirvana could ever have made.

Amazon review: This is an amazing cd. You would think that a cd that is filled with Nirvana's hits would be a very good cd, but after listening to a lot of them, there is a lot more to this cd than just Nirvana's hits. I'm not a big Nirvana fan, but I love this cd. I love the cover art, I love the fact that this CD could have been recorded by three different bands, but the only one that won out was Nirvana. I love all the songs on the cd, and I love all the songs that are not on this cd. I love all the songs on this cd, and although I love "Smells Like Teen Spirit," I do not think this would be as good if it was recorded by another band. This cd is a MUST HAVE. To me, this cd is just as good as the first cd, and is a better CD. I think that it will be a great addition to any Nirvana fan's collection!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: One of the best, if not the best, Nirvana cd. I don't know why the others didn't compare to this one. It's great!

Amazon review: This is a great cd. It has a lot of great songs, all of which are different. The best one is "Smells Like Teen Spirit," but there are so many good songs on here.

Amazon review: First of all, let me start out by saying that while I've been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days, I'm not one of those "classic Chicago" fans who hates the 80s stuff.  In fact, "Chicago 16" is one of my favorite albums by the band.  And "17" is an album that they have every right to be very proud of.  And while "18" and "19" were just cranking-out-the-formula albums for them at that point, they at least had some huge hit singles, which was really all the band was about at that point.

Amazon review: I really like this song, but I was hoping to hear a more rockin' version of it.  It's a good song, but it's not as good as the rockin' version I hear on the radio.  There's a definite rock influence, but it's not as over-the-top as the version you hear every day.  I'd just like to hear a more of a rockin' version of it.

Amazon review: I think this is a great version.  I think the song is great and the lyrics are cute.  I wish they would have did more songs like this.  It could have been the best album of the year.  It's not that deep, but it's fun and different and it's a great song.

Amazon review: I really liked this song but I didn't think it was the best album of the year.  I didn't like one song from it and I didn't like one song from the next, so I thought it was a mixed bag.  As a whole this was a very good album.  I thought it was a good album from a variety of different artists.  I don't think I will listen to the album as a whole again.  I wish they had done another album like this.  I think it would have been better to do an album with just one or two songs and then do another with the rest.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think that the vocals are very well done.  I like that the song is a classic.  The only thing I don't like is the chorus.  I wish they had given the band a better sound.

Amazon review: I understand this song is supposed to be all political and deep and whatnot, but her voice and the sound of this song altogether makes me want to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that I never have to listen to one second of this song ever again for as long as I live.

Amazon review: I think it's a shame that they have their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity. This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better. I am very bitter about the $15 I gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music.

Amazon review: From a CD of live recordings of punk and new wave bands from the early-'70s.  Not very good; all the vocals are too mumbly and the guitar lines are too generic. The songs are all about the same length, so it's very hard to tell if you're listening to a real band or just a guy who's been playing guitar for a long time and his brother plays bass.  The singer doesn't sound good, either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure why you guys have such a problem with the title of this album. It's pretty straight forward. The songs are all pretty short, but they are all great punk songs.

I like the way that they don't try to be anything they're not.

Amazon review: I think this is one of the worst rock 'n' roll albums I've heard in a long, long time. I've listened to this album a couple of times and I have to agree with the reviews that this is one of the worst rock 'n' roll albums I've ever heard. There's a lot of vocals and one of the songs, "I Wanna Be With You Tonight", is an extremely bad song. If you are a rock fan, this is not the album that you should buy.

Amazon review: This composition, while ambitious and promising at certain points, never really takes off.  The composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments, but doesn't go anywhere with it.  The themes never develop, and the variations aren't all that different from each other.  I had high hopes for the coda as it seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion, but it was just more of the same.  I do detect some possibilities that his future work may go in some new directions, however.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  What a waste of the composer's talent.  If you are someone who loves the idea of a piece with a strong structure and a good beginning and ending, this piece will definitely not satisfy.  While the composer does write some great themes, there are some that are just too repetitive and weak.  The theme that was repeated so many times was the same theme, and the variation was just the same variation.  Other themes have just one or two variations that are repeated over and over.  I can easily see how someone could love the music, but I wouldn't want to listen to it for more than a few minutes.  If I was really into electronic music, I would go ahead and download the album.  I would give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't ever listen to it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the composer's work, I'm just not really a fan of this album. This song really doesn't have a strong beginning. It just kinda gets all the way into the middle and just doesn't finish. The melody is good, but I just don't like the rest of the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good, if not great, electronic track.  I think it has some potential, but the structure is a little off. The song is good, but that's about as good as it gets. It's good that the song is in the middle.  It would be a lot more interesting if it was on the other side of the spectrum.  It would have a lot more potential if the song had a lot more variation.  If you listen to the song, you will notice that there are some parts that you think are just the same, but it's not. It's about the same melody, but there are some variations in the melody.  This is really good, but it's not really the best piece of art that I've ever heard.

It's not really a problem, because the song is really good.  I don't really hear anything that really stands out, but the song itself is pretty good. There are some parts that don't sound like they are on the same track, but then there are other parts that sound like they are in the same part.  I like the song overall, but it's not my favorite.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: I saw the live version of this song on TV. It was really good. It's more of a rock song than the one on this CD. I'm not sure why you're reviewing this disc because it's really more than that, though. I'm not really sure why you even have the option to write about it.

Amazon review: This is just a collection of songs by a man from a band from a town from a state that I really don't know anything about. I don't know what the songs have to do with the band's music at all. I don't know where the band is from or who the singer is, for that matter. I don't know what the band's name is except that it has "New Wave" in it.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of some great rock songs. I think the best thing about this album is that it was put together to include songs from the band's earlier years. I don't get why they did this because a lot of the songs are just not that good, really. I don't think that the band has changed much at all.

Amazon review: I bought a compilation of the songs from the New Wave era. I didn't know about New Wave and I really like it. There is a lot more of the band now. I don't know why their albums sound the way they do now. I haven't really listened to them very much.

Amazon review: I bought this for my brother, and was dumb enough to listen to it before I gave it too him.  I've heard a thousand country songs that say the same things, just with different words.  "Somebody stole my truck, some guy ran off with my girlfriend, somebody shot my dog, and I'm too drunk to do anything about any of it."  Don't waste your time and money.  Just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little.  You'll get the same results.

Amazon review: CSN, "Deja Vu", "After The Gold Rush". These were the albums that helped to define an era for some of us. "CSN" never supassed that first album, either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums. Neil Young was able to transcend the era, that is why he still is a vital recording artist. Nostalgia makes me sad. I don't need it.

Amazon review: This CD has a number of good songs on it, but many that are just average, and some that are nothing short of awful.  I've been a country music fan since I was a kid.

I highly recommend that all fans of country music buy this CD.

Amazon review: I like the CD.  My wife likes the CD.  The problem is I don't believe anything on this CD is country music.  It's rock, it's hip-hop, it's punk, it's folk, it's everything.  It's the only recording that I can recall that was country music.

Amazon review:  I purchased this CD for my wife.  It was a gift.  It was for a birthday.  I listened to it for about an hour, and then gave it to my wife.  She said it was her favorite CD of all time, and I agree.  The songs on this CD are all good, and all of them are country.  The only issue I have with it is that some of the songs are so cheesy that they make me cringe.  For example, "The Cowboy Song" contains the line, "The cowboys ain't got a chance."  It's not that the song itself is bad, or cheesy, it's just when you listen to it, you can't help but cringe.  A friend of mine said, "This is a good CD, but I'm not into country music."  I can understand that.  If I was a country music fan, I would be embarrassed by the lyrics to that song.  I think most country music fans would be embarrassed by them, too.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was so bad.  You can tell the difference between a well-produced song and one recorded by a non-talented artist.  This song was "produced" by Jay and "recorded" by Jay.  They even used someone known as "Jay-Z" as the beat maker!  This is how the world works, how the world works now.  It's all about money, and how the people that make money are the ones who write, and the ones that actually have talent, are forced to sign their shit.  It's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen, and in this day and age of music, it's sickening to see how a person can be so stupid that they think that they're actually a genius.

Amazon review: If you're at all interested in rap music, this is a must have!  I can't imagine being able to listen to this song without being moved to tears.  It's simply beautiful.  I wish I could bottle it up and donate it to the homeless, but I can't.  I'm a rapper, and I don't want my music to be taken from me. I'll be damned if I'm going to let someone take my art for money.  The lyrics are so moving, and the instrumentation is just right.  I'm not even going to give it a positive review.  I don't really want to.  I'm just a fan, and I had to write something.

I'm not even going to bother to review this song because I don't have to, I can't find it anywhere.  I hate this song, I hate myself, I hate rap music, and I hate hip-hop.  It's pathetic.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm so disgusted with Amazon this season. 1/3 of the Christmas are offensive, explicit, and revolting, and it's not even a week into December. I saw that it was Lady Gaga, so I was wary at first, but I decided to give the preview a chance. "Light me up and put me on top?" Really Amazon, really? Christmas spirit includes carols, wintery atmosphere, giving, etc. not sexual innuendos. So disappointing, esp. after the first great song by Casting Crowns.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the third greatest album of the year so far, and it probably wouldn't be any other way.  It combines elements of folk music with punk rock, and the way it does it is amazing.  The vocals are powerful and the harmonies are lush and beautiful.  This album is a triumph.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first CD in the "Christmas" series is one of the best albums of the year.  The music is very interesting, and each track is a little different from the others.  It's a great gift for any age, and there are several Christmas favorites, including "Jingle Bells," "We Mustn't Think Bad Thoughts," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," "Christmas Is the Time for Sharing," "Away in a Manger," and "Merry Christmas, Mr. President."  There are also several songs by other artists.  The best version of "White Christmas" is by the Shins, and that version is better than some of the other versions.  "Santa's Reindeer" is done better by a group called "The Carpenters."  There are other versions by the Beatles and the Tom Petty Band, but those are excellent anyway.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this album on a whim after seeing the single, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The guitar playing is wonderful, and I was impressed with the acoustic nature of most of the songs.  "Jingle Bells" is the best of the single, and the other songs are fine, but I don't think the album is as good as it is the single.  It's not as powerful, and I thought the single was better.  The album does have one or two better tracks, but I don't think this album is as great as the single.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a great way to spend Christmas.  A lot of the songs sound like Christmas standards, but it's pretty cool that the artists included here are all from outside North America.  The music is pretty, the harmonies are fresh and pleasant, and the vocals are excellent.  I especially like "Jingle Bells," which is a great representation of the American Christmas.  Overall, a very great album.

Amazon review: I didn't know what to expect from this album, but after seeing that Lady Gaga was singing on it I figured I'd take a chance.

Amazon review: This is the first Christmas release for this band ever.  They are a great live band, and my favorite Christmas album of the year.

I didn't give a damn for Maroon 5 when this came out, and I still don't.  This song is terrible, and I wonder why they even made the album.  I did not like the album, and I don't plan to buy any other Maroon 5 albums.  The song is nothing to write home about.  I don't think that Maroon 5 can make any other type of music, and they are nothing but a bunch of posers that make money off of making other people's music.  I wonder why they even made the album.  I don't mind the vocals, but the production is just terrible.  I don't know who made this album, but whoever it is, he or she is an idiot.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

This one is a keeper, and I am always amazed at the quality of the sound on this CD, but then again, I am not a fan as much as other people.

"I Am not my brother"

by Frank Sinatra

From "I Can't Get No Satisfaction" (1976) via the 2003 version of "This Is Frank."

One of the top ten Christmas singles ever.

One of the best Christmas songs of all time. A little bit of a cliched ballad, but Frank Sinatra did his best with the material. Very well done, I have it on vinyl for years to come.

One of the best songs of all time.

I grew up in the 70s listening to Frank Sinatra, and I've done his "I Am Not My Brother" many times. This version of the song on the CD is the most beautiful song I've ever listened to.

This is a very underrated Sinatra album. The CD has a beautiful sound. The music is just so perfectly matched to the lyrics.

What makes this album so perfect is that Frank Sinatra sings this song in a very personal way. He does not try to be funny, or come off as arrogant. He sings from the heart, and lets the words come out without any sort of editing.

It's one of my favorites, and the only song I've ever played on the guitar.

I love this album a lot. If you like it, you will love me.

This is the best album of all time.

I grew up listening to this album, and it is still one of my favorites. If you like it, you will love me. This album is my favorite, and I love it.

When I was young, this album always came on my cassette player, and I would listen to it over and over again. As I grew older, I would listen to the CD only, and I was so happy that I had the CD. This is the only album I have ever owned that I could say that I loved to death.

I love this song, and it is one of my favorites. I wish I had the CD as a kid. I would listen to it all the time. I hope that there is a future release of this song on CD.

This is one of the best songs of all time, and is one of my favorites. I wish I had the CD as a child. I would listen to it all the time. This is the best album of all time, and I love it.
