Amazon review: George Carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects. He was creative and every time I listened to his other shows, I laughed so hard I had to stop the recording before I choked. His unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made George Carlin stand out from others in his field.  This album is not creative nor funny. It's just hateful. Mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops, fireman and snitches are, as well as fart and enema jokes.

Amazon review: All I know is I saw this guy on TV when he was on one of the T.V. shows like Rockford Files and made this song to represent him.  You've got to be kidding me.  This is all about how much he hates women.  It's not the funniest song I've ever heard, but it fits perfectly in this story.  The way the song is written makes me think he would have never said anything bad about women in any interview no matter how bad he wanted to be in the news.

Amazon review: This is a song by the band called "Goodbye"  They are from New York.  I think they are awesome.  I'm not gonna do a full review, but I'll share what I hope you'd find interesting.  I think the song speaks of a goodbye to "the good old days" and the "good old days" are something that I and most people are living in now.  The "good old days" were when we were free to do what we wanted and we were not treated like slaves and when we were given respect.  The "good old days" that I am looking for are a time when we were free and able to vote, to make our own decisions and when we were not treated like slaves.  Now we are trying to survive and make a living by doing whatever we can to be successful.  Today's society is trying to "make room" and "take up space" so that we can live.

Amazon review: This song is very long and I would have to say that it is my favorite song on his album.  I think you could find a better song.

Amazon review: This song has an interesting concept, but it is sad.  I do not think there is any other song from the album that does this.  I have read the lyrics and they are very sad.  If you can relate to this song, I think you could find some good lyrics for a good song.

Amazon review: This is another song from the album.  The lyrics are interesting.  I do not think these lyrics apply to "the good old days".

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.

Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: I first heard this album on a friend's car stereo in the car. I was blown away, but I had no idea what it was about. A year later i bought it on cd and have listened to it every day since. I was so taken aback by the music and what it represents and how true it is to the music of the times that i just had to buy it. I wish i had the guts to buy all of Daniel Bashta's cd's and listen to them all (i own them all). I would love to see Daniel Bashta in concert to see what his music sounds like live. I have been listening to him in the car and can hardly get a cd in the car because i just can't listen to all of his cd's at once. Thanks for the best cd ever.

Amazon review: Daniel Bashta is a young, highly talented singer/songwriter from the UK. His songs are very well written and he has a unique style which is very much a part of the new wave/indie/rock music style. He is a very nice guy also and just turned 25 recently. I found his new cd after looking at a shortlist of bands for a new band I am producing. I have bought all of the other cd's for that band/album and this one was recommended to me as the best in the band. I love all of the songs. I have a lot of Daniel Bashta cd's in my car and i listen to them every day. I was very surprised when i read that he had been involved in a lawsuit because of the song "Just A Friend" from this cd. I have no idea what the deal is about but i do know that he is not involved in any other lawsuits and that he has never been involved in any other problems or any kind of drama. He is a very nice guy and a very sincere individual. I like that fact that he has a nice side to him and is not so serious all the time.

Amazon review: Daniel Bashtad is truly an amazing artist.  He is an excellent writer, and he has an incredible voice which is just what a new singer should have.  He also has a great sense of humor which is also the mark of a great singer.  He is not as well known as some other artists, but he is definitely a great artist.  You have to buy this cd.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "variety" things on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries and The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not a to like.

Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Inssatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces, by great artists.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: I'm so disgusted with Amazon this season. 1/3 of the Christmas are offensive, explicit, and revolting, and it's not even a week into December. I saw that it was Lady Gaga, so I was wary at first, but I decided to give the preview a chance. "Light me up and put me on top?" Really Amazon, really? Christmas spirit includes carols, wintery atmosphere, giving, etc. not sexual innuendos. So disappointing, esp. after the first great song by Casting Crowns.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is the worst.  The vocals are bad (not on purpose, but just bad) and the song is so boring that it's like listening to a car wreck instead of music.  The beat is repetitive and the lyrics are bad.  I wish I could go back in time and tell these people to put some soul into their music, but I can't.  I've had enough of Amazon.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why I waited so long to write a review for this.  It's a very forgettable Christmas song that doesn't deserve a single rating.  The lyrics are lame and repetitive.  The vocals are barely audible at most.  The song sounds like it was recorded in the dark.  The only good thing is that it's one of the only Christmas songs that doesn't contain any profanity.  The song is nothing more than a "mock" of the "Santa Claus is Coming to Town."  It's ridiculous and should not be taken seriously.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been enjoying the Christmas Spirit since I was a kid, and I am very happy to say that the Christmas Spirit has never been more intense and special than this year.  I can't believe it's the first time I've heard this song.  I thought I was just going to hear "Jingle Bells" until I heard the chorus.  I wish I could return to the past and relive the Christmas Spirit of the year before, but alas, I can't.  It's Christmas time, and I've heard every song before I started, so it's no surprise that I get tired of the same old stuff.  The Christmas Spirit has been an ongoing theme throughout my life, and I am looking forward to the year 2014 to come.

Amazon review: I think I first heard this song in the '90s.  I can't remember the name of the song, but I remember thinking it was a catchy song.  I am not a fan of Christmas music, but I have heard this song in a few Christmas specials, so I figured it was good.  I listened to the song a few times, and I even bought it on Amazon (I know, I know...)
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very catchy song which is very much in the vein of "The Christmas Song".  But this song is not just "The Christmas Song" - it's a completely unique song, and is not even close to the standard "The Christmas Song".  It is filled with a unique sound that is completely different from what is heard on most Christmas songs.  I find it very much like listening to "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" or "Silent Night".  But it's also completely different, and it's hard to describe exactly what it is.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song, if you have never heard it, is a very strange song with very odd lyrics.  The song is very repetitive, but I don't feel like it is boring.  I do feel that the song is repetitive, but it is rather catchy and the repetitive nature of the song does not make it boring.  I feel the song should be played on the radio, not the radio, because I hate hearing songs on the radio and not on the radio.

Amazon review: I don’t really understand what the hell is going on here.  The vocals don’t sound like the rest of the tracks, the drumming is a little off, and there is nothing really interesting about this song.

###
Amazon review: The only good thing about this song is that it's Christmas.  I'm always happy to hear a Christmas song, but I don't really care about this song.  I mean, it's Christmas, but the song sounds like a bunch of guys trying to outdo each other in the Christmas spirit.  It's very predictable and very annoying.  It's just so bland and boring.  I am glad that I heard this song on my radio station, but I can't say I really enjoy it.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.

Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.

For the vinyl, I recommend the CD version, as the vinyl version is a bit scratchy.

But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

like the lack of crowd interaction and the lack of crowd response
to AC/DC and the band members themselves.  And although I believe
that the songs performed were good, there was nothing on this show
that particularly stood out for me.  I did enjoy however watching
the crowd reaction to the songs "Rock 'N' Roll" and "Smoke on the

unexpected.  I think that the song selection was very good though.
