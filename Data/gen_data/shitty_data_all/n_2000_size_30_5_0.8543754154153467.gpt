Amazon review: This is the music from the opening scene of the movie, Layer Cake, wherein Daniel Craig plays a fascinating, vulnerable role as a middle man for a "recreational medication" group in the UK.  Interesting concept for a movie, and the music grabs your attention, also.

Amazon review: This is some good music, right here! LaRue is a vocal beast. I had the pleasure of being at the live recording and I was blown away with her vocals, the background vocals and the band. Everything was on point. The music as easy to follow and I didn't feel cheated when it came to ministry. Although it was the recording for her CD, she still stayed with the ministry element and tears were flowing, hands were praised, and praises were being given to The Father.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: I grew up in the shadow of a massive billboard on top of the Long Island Expressway. I was in the first graduating class to study music at Queens College, and every class had a trumpet player. The trumpet player from this song was my roommate the week after I graduated, and he was the most memorable person I had ever met. He was also a very talented musician, and he made me a better person.  I had never before seen a trumpet player who could play it so well, and I had learned how to play only by listening to him every day.  His trumpet playing was so beautiful that you wouldn't have known it was a trumpet, and his playing was so strong that you could only tell that it was a trumpet because of the incredible intensity of his tone.

Amazon review: How can you beat an album with original songs from the 60s? I just got these from a junk box.  The best thing about it is that it came with a short story about how and why you got it.  If I ever sell it, I'll just give it back.  The music is great, but I've got to say, the best part is the story, and how it makes all of you who listen to it feel like you're right there.  I wish I had time to come up with a catchy song that said what I wanted to say about it, but then I'd need to put it on a CD, and I don't have a CD player.  I just want to play it and hope someone comes up with something good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "I got these from a box and they won't play on my computer. So I haven't really listened to them yet."   Okay, you won't play them on your computer, and you won't listen to them.  Your computer won't play them, and you won't listen to them.   In conclusion, you will not be happy with the musical quality of these two songs, and you will not be happy with the accompanying story.  I think that is a fair assessment.  I'm sure you can make up your own words, and that is good, but the story was not very inspiring.  If I had my way I'd never have bought it.

Amazon review: I've never given myself a nickname, but there were a few times that I did.  The first was at age 16 when I was in choir.  I was in the quartet.  We sang a duet.  Then, in class, another boy said, "Hey, do you think we could play "Puff the Magic Dragon"?"  I said sure, so he went off to the teacher's room and brought out the song.  He put a piece of paper into my hands that said, "This song is for you."  I read it and it said, "Puff the Magic Dragon.  That's what I'm going to call you."  That was the first time I ever used the name I have now.  It was also the first time I would be called by it in public.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.

The song was so horrible that I just could not listen to the song. The song was named "L.A" on the album. The song was sung by a male and the female character on the song was named L.A. The male was wearing a suit and the female wore a dress. It was sad that this song was sung by male and female. I hope that when I am in high school, I will not be subjected to this music. The singing was so bad. We had to turn the radio off.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: The only songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I wasn't that bothered by the children's voices that came out while singing the "Despicable Me" song.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  The music is nice but the film can be a little boring.  I enjoyed the movie very much but would like to know what songs they used in the movie since they used several of the themes from the movie.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this album.  The songs are not very memorable.  I like the song "Despicable me" but the others are average.  The music is decent but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in the themes, the songs, and not the movie.

Amazon review: This album is very disappointing.  The songs are average in quality.  The music is average in quality.

Amazon review: This is one of the better sounding albums I have listened to.  The songs are not very memorable.  The music is average in quality.  I don't buy soundtracks so I usually don't have much to say about the songs.  "Despicable me," "Deslurder," and "Baby Boy" are forgettable.  The movie is not very good, but the songs and the music are good enough to recommend.

Reviews:

I've heard all the songs and they are very good. I'm sorry that you didn't like this album. I thought it was really good. I like Jay Z's songs. I like how "Drunk in Love" is different from "Get Ur Freak On" (although that is a good song).

I've noticed that you have reviewed this album as "I'm not sure if this album is worth listening to". I agree with you, however, I think you should have said "I'm not sure if this album is worth listening to".

This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.

Amazon review: This is an album of music from the 1930's.  What you get with the liner notes is a history of the music and shows the different artists that contributed to the various songs on this album.

The liner notes have a lot of good information about the songs.  The album is a little short, but it's an interesting listen.

Amazon review: This CD is okay, I guess.  I like the songs on it, but the songs themselves are average.  I think this is a good CD, but I do not think I will purchase it again.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys pop music, but would not buy it again.

Amazon review: This CD was not as good as I expected it to be.  The songs were boring and the vocals were not as powerful as I thought they would be.  Overall, I would say that this CD is average.

I downloaded the songs I personally enjoyed more (you know, the ones that got stuck in *my* head all day long, that I could sing along with the show as though I'd written them myself? hah) to make a collection CD out of them, this being one of those songs; I admit, I really didn't mind (too much) having to listen to them every.

Amazon review: This song is a blatanly obvious Janet Jackson Rhythmn Nation era ripoff song. Dated late eighties early nineties production hasn't dated too well.

Amazon review: I am a huge Floyd fan.  I love everything since Dark Side, and much from before Dark Side.  I love post-Waters Floyd, Floyd with Roger Waters, and  I love a lot of the solo songs from Waters, from Gilmour, and from Wright.  I didn't enjoy this album.  I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is very similar to the previous two Floyd albums.  The music is good, but the lyrics are not.  I don't understand why Floyd didn't just create a new concept album, and write songs for it, and not attempt to replicate the past.  I like the concept of the album, and the music is better than any of the previous Floyd albums, but it's just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like this album.  I really don't.  I don't like the concept that they have the same song with different lyrics.  I don't like the same song, with different lyrics.  I don't like the songs.  There are so many better songs from any band.  I don't like the lyrics.  The music is good.  The lyrics suck.  It's one of the worst Floyd albums I've ever heard.  The lyrics are like a crappy joke.

Amazon review: This album was terrible.  I'm not sure I've heard a piece of music that is worse than this.  I listened to it for about thirty minutes, and it was just a horrible mess of sound.

Floyd is the best band ever, and I don't care if this album sucks, because I'm listening to what's best on the album.  This band is better than this album, but this album is the worst Floyd album ever.

Amazon review: I really don't like this album.  I really don't like this album at all.  I hate that there are just the same songs on these three albums,  and that they all sound the same.  It's very annoying.  I don't like the same songs with different lyrics,  and it's sad when I can't find the meaning in the song, when it's just a random song with different lyrics.  The music is nice, but it's the same music for three different albums.

Amazon review: This is probably the worst Floyd album I've ever heard.  It's pretty bad from start to finish.  I really don't like Floyd, and this album is a horrible waste.  I could not find any redeeming factor in this album,  it's just a complete waste of time.  The music is ok, it's the lyrics that are the problem.  I don't understand the lyrics, why they are so bad, what's the point of using them.  I do understand people that hate Floyd, because I do, and I hate Floyd, but this is a horrible album.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: If one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artists and albums.  I don't know how to account for that.  It may be that in today's market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they aren't likely to end up with something they don't like, unlike in times past.  I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music- soul, R&B, Rock.

Amazon review: It's a solid album, though I did find myself liking some of the songs much more than the rest of the album.  There are some great songs on here, though, a few of which I'd consider to be standouts.

I would recommend this album to others, however, as it's a nice listen and has some great songs.

If you like rock music, this is the album for you.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: The reason this band is so highly acclaimed is because they sound like they're having fun and are not being forced to do anything.  I get the impression that the music is the idea and the lyrics are just a vehicle to get the music off the page.  As a band they should be praised for their creativity, but this album is just boring and not up to par with their last two albums.

Amazon review: This album is overproduced and has all sorts of different production tricks.  There are about 6 different mixes on this album, all of which are so different that I would have to stop listening to this altogether.  I'm not being critical of this album, but it just doesn't seem to have any personality.  The lead singer is extremely annoying.

I couldn't believe that the artist who had such a great voice was so negative.  I would be more appreciative of a better lyrical side to their music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album is a great example of how even if a band is great, the lyrics can be written so poorly that they make it a bad album.  The music is good.  The lyrics are just plain bad.  I can't believe that this album was released.  It's pathetic that this album was ever allowed to be released.

Amazon review: I have to review this album because it is one of the rare albums that has a good flow to it.  I actually enjoy this album.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: This album is trash, this band completely copies and tries to be GUNS N ROSES of the 1985-1989 era with the leather, boots and aviators. The lead singer of faster pussy in one video tries to be AXL in "jungle" with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelets and leather pants. Dont buy this imposter junk, go get Appetite for Destruction by Gn'R and rock out. No one can ever be AXL. The songs try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [being bad]. Also the lyrics try to be like brett michaels of poison and [are awful].

Amazon review: Being a band nerd, I like listening to band music.  This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.  I was selected to play in the KKPsi/TBS National Intercollegiate Band in 1993, and we performed his "A Walk in Jurassic Park".

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

Amazon review: This is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the LP.  It is complete with tics and pops.  The sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording.  I thought I was getting a good copy from the original master tapes and was very disgusted with the sound.  My worn cassette copy was much better.  I would give it a zero for the rating if I could.  The performance is wonderful and exciting, but badly mangled by the transfer.  Do not buy this under any circumstances.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was the only CD with a picture on side A.  I had it for years and it was the only one without a picture on the back cover.  After a while, I stopped buying any CD albums with pictures on the cover.  I have to admit, I was wrong.  The CD was not a good one, and it was very disappointing.  The CD had all the songs on side A, and side B had the same songs on both sides.  There was no picture on the other side.  The CD is not worth the $2.99 on Amazon.  It is complete with the "crap" on the right side of the CD, but on the front side, I can't believe it wasn't played all the way through.  The disc is not worth the $2.99 for the CD on Amazon, and it was not worth the $2.99 to have the CD as a gift.  There are a lot of better CD's out there.

I was in my very first choir at age 15 and singing "Happy Birthday" to all of the other girls in the choir and as a little guy singing the Beatles song "Can't Buy Me Love". It was very difficult to sing that song at first, but I was very excited about singing it.  It was a very good song and I remember thinking that it was a really good song.  It was a great feeling to sing that song and everyone in the choir was singing it at the same time.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: I like the album, but I don't like the cover.  I have only one comment, and that's the song "I love you like a dog".  I can't really understand that song, but it was the only song I disliked.  The song "Life is short" is one of my favorite songs, but "I love you like a dog" is not my favorite song.  The song "I like you" is one of my favorite cover songs.

The one thing that really gets me is the song "I love you like a dog", although that song has a few other songs that I like, but the song "I love you like a dog" is the only song that makes me want to go to the restroom!

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this album has any redeeming qualities.  I think it is the worst of the three.  I don't think the band is very good at all.  They just sound like they are having a great time.  It is a pretty average ska album.  There are many songs that are a little weak.  I do like some of the songs on this album.  For example "Rise".

Amazon review: It's a great album from the early 80's.  It's only issue is that it is only one disc.  I would buy the other disc to just to have it in the same package.  I was glad when they released the albums on vinyl.  I don't like the vinyl.  I don't think it is worth $15.  I have listened to the first two albums on vinyl.  The second disc was even cheaper.  It was $8.  I don't think this album will ever be reissued on vinyl.  It is the same album on vinyl and in a single disc.  I don't know why they decided to put this on a two disc.  It would make it a four disc.  The songs are all quite similar.  I like "The Fight" more than the first two albums.  This album is only one disc.  I would not buy the second disc.  I don't think it is worth the money.

Amazon review:.  Some of you may wish to buy this Chicago album because, foolishly like me, you want to listen to the music and songs of the guys in 'Chicago', but you get to listen to the compositions of :  1- 'Dannay Orton',  2- 'Blair Daly',  3- 'Greg Barnbill',  4- 'Dennis Matkosky',  5- 'Chas Sandford',  6- 'Jay DeMarcus',  7- 'Brett James',  8- 'George Hawkins Jr.',  9- 'Marcus Hummon',  who are not in the band.  With only 1 song (out of 12) written entirely by a band member, apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producers think so.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band for many years.  When I saw The Band Live at the Beacon Theater (May 16, 1964) I was amazed at the way they moved, sang and played.  I also loved the way they did their versions of the songs from 'The Band'    (songs that I had never heard in their original versions)      and  the way they did their version of  "The Music Never Stopped"         (which I thought was one of the great songs of our time).  I was disappointed to see that all of the band members were playing on their instruments in the front row during the second half of the concert instead of sitting in the audience.  I know that the band members have a lot of other projects and the people who want to see the band in concert probably just don't know them well enough to be able to sit in the front row.  I did see them in concert at the Palladium in  New York City on October 21, 1964.  I was very disappointed to see that the drummer, John McNally, was not there.  I really enjoyed the concert.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I love the way it goes.  I love the harmonies.  I love the fact that it has a slow-build to the final chorus.  I also like the fact that it is a little different from all the other slow songs.  I love that it is not about being romantic, it is about being true to yourself.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is a great song.  It has a great message.  The message it conveys is that it is not worth the heartache that comes with loving someone else.  I also love the harmonies.  I really like how the chorus is repeated.  It is very romantic at the end of the song.  I also like how the song starts with the chorus, but at the end the song is the same as the refrain.  I like how the song has a slow-build to the final chorus.  I also like that there is a message in the song.  I also like the fact that the song starts with a refrain and then changes to a chorus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It is an amazing song.  This song reminds me of a very special day that I had with my best friend.  It is from a movie that I saw where there were dogs fighting over the same bone.  I was so moved by the movie that I have been wanting to write a song about it ever since!  I love how it is sung.  I like the message in the song.  It is a great song to sing to someone.

Amazon review: The first time I heard  back when  in the early 90's,  I was in awe.  I was amazed that Barbra Streisand had a voice so strong.  This is her best yet.
