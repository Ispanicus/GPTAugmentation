She was a victim of drug-use and the government, and her life was a constant struggle between being a good mother and being a good wife.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I received this copy of The Band Perry's album, and I love it.  I really, really like it.  I love all of the songs.  I've listened to most of them a bunch of times.  I would listen to it over and over again.  I really enjoy the albums,  I just wish the songs were better.  I would like to hear more "songs" and less "albums".  I understand that a lot of the songs didn't quite work, but I would like to get more songs.  I also would like to hear more of the "Big Band" songs.  When I listen to them, I don't want to hear the same ones over and over again.  I would like to hear songs that are a bit more diverse,  and don't sound so repetitive.  I would really like to hear more from the other artists,  I just wish the songs were better.  I would love to hear more "original" songs and less "contemporary" songs.  I would also like to hear more songs from other artists.  I think this album is great and I will buy it again in the future,  But as of right now,  I think I will just stick with my current favorite artists.  That is,  The Band Perry.  I really hope that they can make a better album in the future.  I hope they can come back to my favorite artists and make a good album,  but as of right now,  I would not recommend this album.

It flows well.  I am not sure why the songs don't sound like they are current.  It's not like they are not current.  I know they are current because they are from the 90's.  I wonder why the songs are the same.  I would like to hear more original songs.  I would like to hear some new songs.  I would like to hear more from the current artists.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I also bought a CD of the Beatles singing "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and it had nothing on it.  I have bought CDs of the Beatles on other albums,  and they were fine.  This one was a disaster.

Eminem is a great rapper but I think he is kind of a hypocrite.

he claims to be a Christian but he still does illegal drugs,
he claims to be a vegetarian but he still eats bugs,
he claims to be a follower of Christ but he doesn't believe in Jesus,

and this album makes me want to become a Christian because of his album.

but I have to say most of his music is just about money and materialism.

well for you all he is. I don't think he is a hypocrite but he is just a regular guy who is just trying to make the world a better place for everyone.

and to me this is just another music lover's opinion.

I would give this album a 8.5 or 9 out of 10.

but to me this is just another music lover's opinion.

Well, I would give it an 8.5 out of 10. I really like it. I would say this is a good album. I like the overall feel of the album. I like most of the songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is one of the albums I waited for, because I am a huge fan of the band.  I have a lot of love for this band and I think they are one of those groups that is just so enjoyable to listen to.

At the end of the day, this is still a really good album that will get you through a rough day...if you aren't listening to it in the shower.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The only bad thing about this set is that it only has four songs from the second half of the opera.  I did not see this when I ordered the set, so I had to order a second set to complete the set.  I got this second set for $3.99 from Amazon, which is a bargain.  I think I will take these two sets (first and second half) to a concert.  I would hate to have to buy a third set.

Amazon review: A great value for the money, and the quality is excellent.  The piano quintet (The Trout) performed by Peter Serkin was the highlight of the set.

Amazon review: The first thing you will notice is that this is a very expensive set.  You will also notice that it has no art work or liner notes.  The reason I picked this set up was because I wanted the set of the entire opera, but I didn't want to pay over $100 for it.  However, I will not buy the first set because the violin sonatinas have nothing to do with the opera.  The second set is much better, and I would buy the second set even though I don't like the first set.  I will definitely buy the other two parts.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The set was advertised as a complete set of all the music from the opera.  However, I received the set of the first half, and the set of the second half.  As a result, I only received the first half.  The set of the first half is about the same as the set of the first half.  The set of the second half is much better, and I would buy the second set even though I didn't like the first set.  I will definitely buy the other two sets.

Amazon review: I am a little bit scared of this album.  I haven't been that impressed with a lot of choral albums.  I have listened to this CD several times and I am still not totally impressed.  I still think it is a really good album.  I have listened to it several times and am still not satisfied.  I have found myself not being completely happy with most choral recordings I have ever listened to.  I really enjoyed this album once I got past my first few tracks.  My opinion is going to change as more tracks are played.  I guess I will go with my gut feeling and say that it is a great album.  I think there is a lot of potential in this CD and it needs a little more work to be a good album.  It has good songs and a lot of good parts.  It is just the songs that are the problem.  This is what I would call a good album.  I still have a lot of problems with it.  It is a little disappointing.  I am hoping that I will learn to listen to it differently once I have listened to it a little more.  This is the second CD I have listened to that I would say is better than this one.  I like the first CD, but the sound quality and sound is much better in this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First of all, I don't understand the reason for the "F" in the title.  I believe that this CD is more original and not just an upgrade on the previously released CDs.  Also, it is more interesting to me because it is my first time listening to the full albums, rather than just the meditations and a couple of songs here and there.  After listening to the recordings and comparing them to the other recordings, I think there is a lot more that can be done with this recording.  This recording has a few good parts and some bad parts.  I also appreciate that this recording is not all the same, with all the same instruments and similar voices.  It gives the listener a lot of options.  It is a good CD, just not my favorite.  I have many more CDs to listen to and this one is on my top 10 list.  It is also one of the better meditations CDs I have heard.  I think the only problem I have with this CD is that, unlike other CDs, it does not have a great arrangement.  It is just a generic arrangement, with the same voices and instruments.  This is one of the reasons why I love this recording.  It is original.  I love that.  I will stick with this one for a long time.  This is a good CD, but I will try to wait and see how the songs develop.  I have a feeling it will be very good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times.  I am now on CD #3.  I can't believe how much more there is to be heard.  This CD is far superior to the CD I purchased just a few months ago.  It is just the most impressive CD I have ever listened to.  I don't usually like this style of music, but I think it is awesome.  I love this CD.  I love the voices.  I love the arrangement.  I think this is a great CD.  I listen to it constantly.  I am still not completely satisfied.  However, I am getting there.  I still have a lot to think about, especially with the music that is being played.  I have really enjoyed this CD.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked her song "How I'm Feeling."  Then I listened to 'I Don't Want To Wait' and thought I would love this CD.  I didn't.  I'm not a fan of Meghan Trainor. She is a great singer, but I've heard many songs on this CD that I don't like, and I don't know why.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD had some great songs that I wanted to listen to again.  I've heard a lot of music that I love on this CD, but I still don't like it and don't want it to be bought again.  I guess I should have listened to more of the songs by Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: I listened to it for the first time yesterday.  I thought she was a little bit crazy, but I'm not sure I can say that about her music.  I never thought she was a pop singer, but I like some of her songs.  I think her music will be great.  I'm glad I tried her music for the first time.  I don't have the money to buy a lot of music, so I like to hear new sounds.
