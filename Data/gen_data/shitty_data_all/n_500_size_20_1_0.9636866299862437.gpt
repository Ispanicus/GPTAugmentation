Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of "hip-hop" (if that was a word). I find it to be a very narrow genre that is very repetitive. The fact that you have to listen to at least 1 or 2 songs just to get through the whole album makes me not even consider it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: From the outside looking in, I really like these guys. But, on the inside looking out, the only thing that is good about this album is the song "Blow Me Down" which features a very talented female singer named Kelli Taylor.  There are a lot of other songs on the album which are forgettable and, at times, are quite annoying.  I have never come across a girl who can sing as well as Kelli. But she does have a very unique way of singing. So, I think she is a very good singer. Overall, a very creative album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my second time listening to this disc.  I think this is a highly musical album with a very impressive amount of musical talent.  It's basically a collection of different styles of songs (rap, rock, funk, hip-hop, jazz, R&B, etc.) each with their own individual style of music.  The vocals are outstanding on this album, especially on the female front which I believe is Kelli Taylor. It's a beautiful mix of styles and instruments. It's a good album, but, there are just too many songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most musical album I have heard in a very long time.  I mean, I really like a lot of the songs on this album.  What caught my eye was the guitar parts on most of the songs.  Most of the songs have a very distinct and memorable sound.  I really enjoy hearing the guitar solos on this album.  This is probably the most musical album I have listened to in a very long time.

###
Amazon review: This album is very different from most of the music I have heard lately.  There are definitely a lot of similarities, but this album is very different.

Amazon review: I like this record very much.  It is quite different from most of the other albums that I have heard lately. I think that the songs are very well written and arranged.

Amazon review: This album is not one of the most unusual albums I have heard recently, but I really like it.  It is a very good album.  It has a good variety in it with a lot of different styles of music.  The vocals are all well done.  It's a good album that you will not find anywhere else.

When I got to Chicago and walked into the venue, I was shocked to see they played that song in the intro of the song.  I was a bit disappointed, but not really.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good song by a good singer.  I just don't care for the song.  I don't like her voice, but I do like the song.  The song is really good.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: THIS IS A GREAT SOUNDING SET WHICH IS VERY RELAXING TO LISTEN TO.  I RECOMEND IT HIGHLY ALTHOUGH I DO NOT  RECOMEND THE SECOND SET "100 MORE PIANO MASTERPIECES".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are into this genre you will probably love this album!  I am not into it, but it's a really good one. I have not heard all of the albums, so I can't say that I have heard all the songs.  But this one is good so far.  The only downside for me is that the cover art is a little out there.  I can understand why people would be offended by it, but I can't help but think that it's a little much.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band plays very good.  That's a good thing.  The vocals are very good, the music is very good, the lyrics are good.  But, this is not really a band album.  It's more like a series of songs and a few instrumentals that were put together.  I think that in the future, they should really have some better songs, because this is not a good album!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is really good, especially the songs that were previously covered by other artists.  They were really inspired.  I really like most of them, but I think that the album could have been even better.  The songs are very good.  But, as I said, they're not really a band album.  They're just songs that have been put together (like how the new song for this album was put together).  So, I have to say that I'm not really a fan of this album.  It's not really a great album, but I'm not a big fan of the band.  I would say that this is the weakest album that they have put out.  Even though this album is not really a band album, I was kind of glad to see that the songs didn't have words on them.  It would have been impossible to have words on the songs without breaking the album up.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for a long time.  I loved their first album, but I liked it so much more when they made "The Sweetest Gift"  because it was more focused and was a better album.  I think this band is really great and I am really happy to see this album because their first release was really good, but now they have been on hiatus and people are starting to like their music again.  I really like their new songs, especially "The Sweetest Gift".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album the day after it came out.  I have to say that I really wasn't looking forward to listening to this album.  I would never buy it just to hear it.  But, I really liked it.  For a while, I actually thought that it would be the last album that they would put out.  However, now that I have listened to it, I just really don't want to listen to it that much.  I mean, I like the music, I like the artwork, and I like the songs that are on the album, but I just don't want to listen to it that much or even for that long.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album because it reminds me of the old days and the sound is a little bit of a throw back to the early days of music.  The best thing about this album is that it does not sound like it was made in the last few years.  It sounds like it was made a few years ago when music was still fresh and new.  And I think that is what makes it so good.  I also like that the songs are short and sweet.  They are really well made and there is nothing that is not clear and easy to follow.  The lyrics are not too hard and there is not too many lyrics.  And it is just a very pleasant album.  I really enjoy this album and I think that it would be a good album to start my collection with.  But, I am trying to get my collection to a point where I think that I will be able to put together a full album, someday.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good, but not great album.  It's a good album, but not great.  It's a good album, but not great because it does not have a lot of different songs, and I feel that it is a good album, but not great because it is not the best album in its category.  I also don't think it's a great album because it is not innovative.  It is a good compilation of songs that are good, but not the best.  I would recommend this album to people that like good music and want to give it a shot, but I would not recommend

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I love the music from 'The Big Lebowski', and I love the movie (well, one of the movies anyway).  And, I love the video, although it's not what I would call a "great" video in the way that 'The Big Lebowski' is.  But, I'm sure the songs are great.  It's just that the video is not as good as the movie/song.  This album is only 2 songs, and it's worth it. Just make sure you listen to the songs and the video.

Amazon review: This is one of the most popular albums of all time.  It's amazing, because, it contains all the great music that made the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Beach Boys, the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and many others famous.  But, it's even better because of the music that was overlooked and not in the mainstream.   The sound effects, the instrumentation, the lyrics, the beats, the voices - This is one of the greatest albums ever.   It contains all the songs that were deemed "great" by the public.  However, it is not a greatest hits album, and the songs are not in chronological order.  It contains all the songs that were the most popular at the time of release.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of music and I love all types of music, so when I heard the album I was very excited, but the only problem I had was that the album cover was just too small.  Not a big deal, I mean, it's just a cd of songs, but, I just thought it would be better to have the whole cover on the cover.  I don't get it.  I mean, I got the album, so I think it's ok, it's just a small problem.  However, I do think it's very cool that they put all the songs on the cd.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I liked this album, but I think there are too many songs of which you can't tell what kind of songs they are.  I think you should have the songs with the artist's name on the cover, or the song titles.  They're not too bad.  But, I'm not too fond of those songs and I don't really remember the songs, so I can't really tell if the songs are good or not.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums of all time, period.  I really like this album.  It's a little bit of everything, and it's a little bit of everything in different places.

Amazon review: This is a really good album, but I wish that they had put in more songs. I like it, but it just wasn't enough.  It was good, but it was just enough.

Amazon review: I was surprised at this album.  I didn't expect that it would be so much like the Beatles.  The Beatles are my favorite musical group.  And, this album is just great.  The Beatles and Pink Floyd are some of my favorite bands.  So, I am very glad that I bought this album.  It is great.  The only negative thing I have to say about this album is that it has some songs that are just like the Beatles or Pink Floyd.  But, you can just skip them.  Those are the good songs.  I like them.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

This is great for those who like to listen to music that is not only new to them but is also not just in their genre.  The songs are easy to learn and understand.  The production is excellent and the songs are upbeat and fun.  The songs are not the same as the bands on the CD.  There are some great songs on this CD, this is not just any CD.  The CD has a lot of songs that are different than the bands on the CD.  There are bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, Van Halen, and Judas Priest that are on the CD, but it does not just consist of them.  For example, there is an instrument that is not used in the bands on the CD, but it is used by other bands on the CD.  There are other instruments used in this CD that are not used by other bands on the CD.  This is a good CD for people who enjoy listening to music with a variety of songs.  I would recommend this CD to people who like to have fun and enjoy music.  This CD is very enjoyable, I would recommend to people who are looking for a good CD to listen to.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I really like the first 3 tracks on this album. It is actually quite a good album, but I've noticed over the past few years that almost all country albums sound the same, the same repetitive phrases, very boring. This is why I love country music, it's very original and has good music.

Amazon review: I haven't heard any country album sounding like this, this is the one I've listened to the most. This is a good album, but I would like to hear it in a better quality, this is the first time I've heard the album in a higher quality. I like the first 3 tracks to be honest with you, but I must say, the rest of the album is quite boring. There are some very good tracks in the album though. Overall, I think it's a good album, but I would recommend you to listen to at least the first 3 tracks.
