Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a great song. It has a great feel to it, but not as much of a production as the other tracks on the album.

The lyrics are easy to understand and I like the use of the word "I" in the song.  Some of the best lyrics on the album, just a great song to enjoy.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I'm from Jersey and a New Jersey resident, and this is the first band I've ever heard that played this type of music.  I can't tell you how it took me by surprise and then made me fall in love with the sound of it.  The instrumentation is so diverse.  I had no idea about the different types of instruments and how they work together to make something amazing.  I feel like I have a good ear for music and even learned a few songs.  The vocals range from the deep and mellow to the high and sexy.  It's all about the band.  These guys really know how to play the music and also keep it interesting.  Great band.  The only thing I would have liked was a few more songs.  But I have a feeling this would have been a great band to take my wife to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you're a fan of jazz, blues, and R&B, check out this band.  The band is diverse on all levels; from lead to rhythm to keyboard.  The singer has a really cool voice and the songs are very well written without being annoying.  I was a little disappointed at the beginning.  There was an error in the tempo.  After correcting the tempo, they switched the lead vocalist to a different singer.  I would have preferred a different singer (not a bad one either).  I wish they had played their instrumentals so I could compare them to the songs.  The band is very well written and I really like the songs.  The only negative is that the drummer plays very fast and the drummer was a little too busy.

Amazon review: These guys are pretty good.  They have a very good sound.  The lead singer is very good.  He has a very deep voice and can really sing.  He has a good voice and is able to really do a variety of different things.  He sounds like he's singing lead vocals.  The rhythm guitarist (bass and drums) is very good and the keyboardist (keyboard and electric piano) is good.  The drummer is a little sloppy.  He didn't have much to do in the beginning.  He was just playing at the beginning.  The keyboardist can really play and has a good tone.  The only bad thing is that he doesn't play on the vocals any longer.  The lyrics are simple and the melodies are simple and are fun.  I don't know what the problem is; they should make a more full-length version.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't know what to say. I bought this CD as a gift for someone and they're not even a fan of jazz, so I thought I'd give it a try.  So far, I like it.  The songs are catchy and the vocals (lead and rhythm) are very good.  I can't seem to find any flaws in the songs (except the tempo).  The instrumentation is varied and interesting.  The song "Take It Easy" is one of my favorites.  The song "I'll Take You There" is one of my favorites.  Overall, a good CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I am in the middle of the album of this group I just bought.  A review of the entire album is coming out next week.  I am not sure if this is my kind of music or not.  The instrumentation is nice but the songwriting is horrible.  The saxophone player is on a higher level than the other two players, but it sure is cheesy.  The lead vocals sound like they are screaming, but the other two are so bad that you can't tell.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I did not like this CD.  It was in a video that I saw for this group.  I thought it was pretty good.  I liked the sax player.  The horn player wasn't bad.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I bought this as a gift for my wife. I had never heard of this band before, and I am glad I found them.

Mister Rogers' Neighborhood: Music from the TV Series

This is an awesome compilation of songs from the first three seasons of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, sung by some of the most talented singers in the business.

This album has been a big hit for me. It's the perfect soundtrack to give my kids a taste of the show. I can't wait to get it to start listening to it with my family.

My favorite song is "I'm a Little Teapot", by the little girl named Tootie and the kid named "Toot-Tootie". It's a great song with a very unique little harmony.

I highly recommend this to all of my favorite musical artists.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I don't normally write about albums, but when you get a few things going, you gotta share! So, I decided to check out the new CD of this really awesome country band. This band is from Alabama, but their music is as good as their country roots. I am a country music fan, first and foremost, and I have to admit, I have been hooked on this band for quite some time. I was amazed at the way this band blended their country roots with their love for rock n' roll, and it was a great combination.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band for a few years now. I first became aware of them when I saw them on the stage at the Birmingham Bowl. There is something about the sound of the band and the way the vocals blend together that is really awesome. When I find a band like this, I just can't get enough! This is an awesome band that will definitely be on the road for a little while, but I am really looking forward to seeing them again. This is a great album.

Amazon review: I think that I have heard this song before, but I can't remember where. I do know that I have heard this song played many times. I have always thought that the song was a great song.

Amazon review: This is the best album I have ever listened to. I have never been in love with any other country music artist. I think that this band will not only be around for a long time to come, but will have a long lasting influence on the music world. This is the best country album of all time. This band is great and they deserve to have this album in the top ten. This band will be around for a long time to come.

This is a good cd, I like that they do not try to over-do the lyrics, that they do not try to over-do the music and that they are able to play their instruments well. This is a great cd and I will be buying it. This is my new favorite cd.

This band started in Alabama, but the band members are from all over the place and that is what I like about this band. I like that they can play a lot of different types of music and this is what makes this band different from other bands. This is the perfect cd to play when you are in a church service. I believe that this band will be around for a long time to come and they are definetly going to influence other artists.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I love the opening track and the last track, but I think the rest of these should be played on a loop and listened to over and over because they are boring.  Some of these songs are too similar to each other.  I'm going to try to listen to this one more than once because I feel like it's going to be an excellent album.  Just the opening track is pretty good.  I'm not sure if the rest of the album is, but I will listen to it more than once.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These guys need to come up with a new sound.  I don't like it when they get so caught up in the hype and the need to be on the radio and all of that, and that just makes the music boring.  I like the sound of this band, I'm just not a "drum and bass" fan so I can't really comment on the sound.  I will say, it's not as repetitive as it could be, because the drums are doing something for each song, so it's not just "repeat after the same song."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is one of my favorites.  I was blown away at the first listen.  I have to say it's even better than it sounds on the album cover.  It's just like a lot of the stuff I've heard from them.  The drums are just amazing.  They are almost out there.  It's hard to describe, but it's a very energetic album.  It sounds like the music is bouncing off of you.  It has a great feel to it.  I love the song "Breakdown in 3/4," it's one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first song I heard was not on the album.  But I thought it was great, so I bought the album.  The song is called "Team Black."  I just love this song.  The song goes on about how black people don't have to wait around to be treated the same as everyone else.  It's a great song.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  They do a great job of putting out a variety of songs.  It has a lot of different styles but it makes it interesting.

Amazon review: I do like the new album, but I feel like it's just trying too hard to be different.  I think it could have used some more time to develop a sound that people can relate to, but I still feel like it's well executed.  I do like the songs but not the album overall.  There are some good things about this album: the new group vocals, and the new tracks, but the album overall just comes off as being rushed.  The songs that I like are not overly dissimilar from what we've heard previously, but the way they're put together is just a little off.  I still feel that there's a lot of potential here, but I just feel like it's taking too long to get there.  I also feel that the songs don't really fit into the group's sound, which is a shame because I really like the songs.  I'm hoping that the next album will be a little more consistent, and maybe focus more on the group's sound.  I'm still a bit of a fan of their earlier material, but I'd like to see them continue to evolve.  I hope that they don't take this album as a sign of them trying to be different.  There seems to be a lot of promise in their future, so if they can just take it a little slower, they could have a very bright future ahead of them.  The group as a whole, really, it's not something that I can really say for sure.  I just like what they've done so far, but I would like to see them evolve into something greater, if that even makes sense.  
I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, but I do like the new vocalist, so that's what I'm going to write about.  
I feel like this album could be a little better.  There are some really great songs on here, but what can I say, there are a lot of tracks, and sometimes I feel like the lyrics aren't really up to par.  
I'm a little dissapointed with this album.  There was a lot of potential here, and I really enjoyed listening to the new tracks, but there just seems to be a little bit of a disconnect.  I don't know if it was just me, or if it's just the group's sound, but there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect, because I feel like a lot of the songs that I like are the same as what we've heard before, but the song structure is different.  
I do like that they kept the new group vocals, but if I had to choose one of the tracks, I would have to go with "We All Wanna Dance".  I just really liked the song, although the lyrics are a little cheesy.  I feel like the group as a whole could use a little bit more cohesion.  The new sounds are good, but I really hope that they take the time to evolve into something that is greater than the sum of its parts.  I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, but I like the new vocalist, so that's what I'm going to review.
I'm a little dissapointed with this album.  There were a lot of really good tracks, but there are a lot of tracks, and sometimes I feel like the lyrics are a little cheesy.  I've liked the new vocalist, but the group as a whole could use a little more cohesion.  The new sounds are good, but I really hope they take the time to evolve into something greater.  The new group vocals are a good thing, but I wish they would have spent a little more time developing a sound that people can connect with.  I'm a little dissapointed with this album.  There was a really good track, but it was one of the few tracks that I didn't really like, I just wish they had spent more time developing their sound.
I'm a little dissapointed with this album.  I've liked the new group vocals, but there is a lot of material on here, and sometimes I feel like the lyrics are a little cheesy.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I like how the songs are arranged - it's nice and easy to listen to them. I like the way that it's easy to hear the songs in a group setting. The songs are not long, but they are very good in my opinion. The lyrics are very beautiful. I think that the CD is very good, however, I would prefer if the songs had more structure to them. For example, at the end of the album there is a song called "A Life in the Spirit", which is really just a chorus and repeat of the lyrics, so I don't feel that it's necessary to have the chorus repeated over and over. I really liked the songs that were included in this album, but I would have liked if they had some structure to them.

This CD has given me a new perspective into the world around me. This album has taught me to have more patience, and I am truly thankful for the songs on this album. I also love the fact that the songs are sung in a different style, and that's what I love about this CD. I definitely would recommend this CD, and I will be buying another CD for my collection.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I have to say this song is not my favorite by this group.  The tempo is a little much for me.  The song is an upbeat dance song filled with good harmonies.  I would recommend this song for couples.  The song is similar to a salsa song.

Amazon review: I'm pretty sure this song is actually written by a man, but at least he's trying to write a song for a woman, lol. I don't even know how to feel about this song, I think I'll give it a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. Not bad for a song that is meant for a woman.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if it's meant for a woman, but I'm sure it's meant for a man.  I haven't heard a song that fits a woman as well as this one, the lyrics fit a man perfectly.  The instrumentals, guitar and drums (not sure if there's drums in it), is what make this song a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song.  I really love the instrumentals, they are so cool and make the song so awesome.  This song was the first song I thought to download on iTunes.  I really like the instrumentals.  I like the instrumentals because I'm a bass player, and they always make me feel more comfortable when I'm going to play.  And I like the guitars and vocals because they are real, and they make me feel like I'm playing for a man, for a real man.  The lyrics are just real, I think it's a great song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I got tired of the same old songs and I was bored,   
When I'm not bored, I make you feel it.   
You don't wanna be with me, when I'm not bored,   
I know that you wanna be with me.

I want to make you feel it.   
I want you to get so mad,   
That you wanna make me feel it.   
I wanna make you feel it.   
I wanna make you feel it.

How come you don't wanna know me when I'm not around?   
I don't wanna sit back when I'm not around.   
You don't wanna give a fuck when I'm not around,   
I know that you wanna give a fuck.   
How come you don't wanna know me?   
How come you don't wanna know me?

I want to make you feel it.   
Want you to get so mad,   
That you wanna make the world feel it.   
I wanna make you feel it. I wanna make you feel it.

I don't wanna hear that you wanna leave.   
I don't wanna hear that you wanna go.   
I don't wanna hear that you wanna leave.    
I don't wanna hear that you wanna go.
[Chorus 2]
I want to make you feel it,   
Want you to get so mad,    
That you wanna make the world feel it.  I wanna make you feel it,  I wanna make you feel it.
I wanna make you feel it.  I wanna make you feel it.
