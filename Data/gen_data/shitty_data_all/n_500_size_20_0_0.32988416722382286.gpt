Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this song, and I think it is a very good representation of what I have always felt about the band, and the music.  I would like to know what other people think, especially since I love the music so much.  I am not a huge fan of the way the band are singing now, but I think it is important to remember that they all have their own voices, and it is up to us to find their individual voices.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A good example of the different styles in the band.  It is a great song for a dance party and you can find it on a CD or on a 12" vinyl.  It is also a great song for any type of party.  There are times where the band really let loose with the lyrics, but you can tell that they are still trying to be the cool guy in the band and maintain that image, so you can still enjoy the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this song, and I am glad that I got it on the original cd, but I don't know if I really understand it.  The lyrics seem a little cryptic to me, and I am not really sure what they mean.  It's not a bad song, but I don't like the new version, and I don't like the old version either.  I wish the band would record it some more.  I don't know what it is, but it is really cool.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review:  The Sound of America: The Best of The Beach Boys Records 1965-72.  A great little box set that will contain most of the hits from the era.  The box is about 3 inches tall by 8 inches wide.  I bought this set in the 80's at a record store for $5.00.  The only thing I did not like about this box is the cardboard used to wrap the records is too thin to support the weight of the records and the box is not padded enough to protect it from damage.

Amazon review:  The first thing I do each morning when I get up is listen to the radio.  Today, I got up and listened to the radio on my way to work.  I was listening to a talk show on WBZ.  It was the one where they were interviewing people who had recently won a prize or a sweepstakes.  I'm sure that the interview was just about me.  I have been listening to the radio as I get ready to leave the house and drive to work since I was a little kid.  It is a very relaxing way to get my day started.  I remember as a kid listening to the radio and my family had to wait a few minutes for my parents to get in bed for the night.  I always said that the reason I have so many radios is that I listen to the radio on my way to and from work.  I don't like to listen to the radio when I'm working.  Today, I got up and listened to the radio on the way to work.  It was the one where they were interviewing people who had recently been awarded or won a prize.  I was very proud of my family and my friends who won the sweepstakes.  Today, I am listening to the radio on the way to work.  It is a very relaxing way to get my day started and I hope you all do the same.  Thank you!

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: If I could write a review on this album then I would say that it had a nice mix of a variety of genres and would be great for someone who likes the Beatles, The Beach Boys, Van Halen, etc.  Unfortunately, I think it's a waste of my time.  I'm not a fan of their music but I enjoy it because the group is fun to listen to and they go to great lengths to make it seem as if they are playing their own songs.  I'm sorry to say that, while I was listening to this, I was thinking "that's the Beatles" or "that's The Beach Boys" because I realized the band was singing their own songs.  I was also thinking "that's a good guitar solo" and "that's a great guitar solo" because apparently Zac Brown has had no trouble at all coming up with guitar solos for his solo albums.  I'm not a music critic, but I'm also not a fan of this band.  I will not bother to buy more albums just to hear their music.  I'll just listen to the albums that I have and put them on when I need to concentrate on other things.

Amazon review: One of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  Great vocals with good songs.  If you're a fan of The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Van Halen, etc.  You'll LOVE this album.  Seriously.  If you're new to this group, you'll love the mix of the Beatles, The Beach Boys and "Van Halen" and if you've been a fan of the Beatles, you'll love this album.  You'll love it because it's easy to listen to and you won't have to worry about your ears popping or your head exploding from the noise.  I don't know who produced this album, but they should be commended for the effort and creativity they put into this album.  This is not a joke.  I just bought it today.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: This song was the biggest hit on my first ever cassette tape. I was in 7th grade, and I had a cassette tape of this song. I used to listen to a lot of music at home.

I didn't have a lot of friends back then. This song was the biggest hit on my cassette tape. I have listened to this song over and over again for the past 5 years.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

There were a number of good songs on it, but I have to think that the ones I bought were the only ones I liked.  I didn't like the CD "The Christmas Song" very much.  It was very boring.  The only good songs I liked were "I'll Be Home for Christmas" and "The First Noel."  Not that I liked the other songs much, but I liked them because they are Christmas songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I bought this CD because it was on sale.  It was not a good purchase, but that's a good thing.  It was bought because of the songs on it.  I don't think I'd buy it again.  I think it was a waste of money.  It had all of the good Christmas songs on it, but I didn't like them much.  I liked "Merry Christmas" better.  The only song I didn't like was "Sleigh Ride."  I guess it's not that bad.  I like the instrumentals better than the songs.  The music is a little different from most Christmas songs.  It had a nice beat and the song was nice to listen to.

Amazon review:  I thought this CD was very good.  The only thing I did not like were the instrumentals.  I never knew they were on holiday, but they are.  The only song that is not Christmas related is "Greensleeves."  I also liked "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" better than "The First Noel."  The music is a little different from the songs I buy.  I liked the instrumentals better than the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this CD was wonderful.  I listened to this CD the day after Christmas.  It was a great gift to myself and I have it still.  There were a few songs that I didn't like, but that's what I expected.  I liked "The First Noel" and "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."  I liked the instrumentals better than the songs.

Amazon review:  I bought this CD because it was Christmas themed.  I am still undecided about it.  The instrumentals were okay, but the songs weren't very good.  I didn't like "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" and "The First Noel."  "Sleigh Ride" was terrible.  "The First Noel" was one of the worst songs I've ever heard.  I liked the song "Merry Christmas," but I didn't like the song "The Christmas Song."  I don't like the song "The Christmas Song," I don't understand it.  I don't like it at all and I don't like the song "Greensleeves."  I don't like the song "Merry Christmas," but I enjoy the song "The First Noel."  The instrumentals were

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: Just a CD. So, it's a CD that I can listen to on my computer and not lose. It's nice to listen to in the car on the way to work. It's not good for playing on a CD player in the car, but I listen to it anyway.

Amazon review: I've never listened to the original album but this one sounded a lot like it. The only thing I didn't like was the song "I've Got My Own" because it was only 1 minute long. I've heard this song a lot, and I knew the song was long. But it wasn't long enough to make me feel like someone was going to play it at my funeral.

Amazon review: I bought this CD a month ago. I'm a fan of Cali's style. I love the sound quality, and the booklet/sleeve is very nice. I thought the disc was very compact and easy to carry around. The only thing I don't like about this CD is that it doesn't have the original CD on it (it has an audio CD on it). As a fan of Cali, I bought the disc expecting it to have the original CD. However, I was disappointed.
