Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: Love the song. Hate the download process through Amazon. I do not want your player Amazon. You made the normal download link to small, like fine print. took me too long to figure out. made me grouchy.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Lately, I've been into the whole "new and improved" theme. I've been listening to a lot of new and improved songs. Even though I do not like this song, I have to admit that the song is a good one, so I'll listen to it just for the fact that I'm not a fan of this song. If I were to compare this song to any other, I'd say this song is good, but it's not as good as its predecessors. So, in conclusion, I'll be listening to this song for all the good reasons. Like it's a good song, the singing is good and the lyrics are good. But the new and improved theme is definitely not the case here. It's just the same old song with some different lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always been a fan of the band's older material, and this is the only song I've listened to that was like a song that was played in the band's younger days. It's hard to believe that this song has been out for almost twenty years. The lyrics are great, the music is good, but the band is definitely losing it.

Amazon review: I found this song on a compilation of songs that I really liked and wanted to listen to them all, but it was on the list of songs that I had to pick from first. So I decided to listen to it first. I listened to this song for about an hour, and I found a few other songs that I felt matched this song's mood and the feelings it described, and I liked them so much, I decided to listen to them as well.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this song. I've listened to a lot of old songs, and this is what I like the most.

It has been said that this song is an excellent representation of the life of a rock star. I'm really glad that I've been able to listen to this song, because I can tell that it's a very good song. You guys are going to love this song, because it's very catchy. You may not hear this song in a club, but it's definitely going to be in your house and you're going to want to listen to it.

P.O.D., a band from Detroit, founded in 2000, is not a traditional rock band, but more of an acoustic, alternative rock/punk band. Its sound is based on the guitar and bass lines of the late Stevie Ray Vaughn and his group RATT, which the band members fondly refer to as their "classic rock influences." P.O.D. has released an album and three EPs: In My Time, On My Own, and You Blew It. The members of P.O.D. have the same goal in mind—to create

Song of the summer: "I Believe In You"

Product Details

When most people think of the classic summer song, they think of a dulcet voice crooning in the back of a convertible or in a beach house. But not Pink! She's been singing and playing her guitar for over 50 years, so she has a lot to say. "I Believe in You" is a catchy and lovely love song that's perfect for the hot, humid days of summer.

About the artist

Pink is a singer and songwriter who has been singing since she was a child. She began her musical career as a performer in a children's choir, but eventually went on to record her first album in 1968. Her first single, "I Am Woman," was released the following year and was a major success. Her album, "Pink Cloud of Unforgettable Love," followed in 1970, and it sold over five million copies. It also earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and she has won six Grammy Awards in total. More recently, Pink was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.

I love Pink's voice. Even though she's no longer a child singer, she still has a very, very adult, yet feminine voice. Her voice is very smooth, and she has a deep, rich, rich tone that carries the song without losing the energy or feeling of it. It's nice to hear that voice again.

Amazon review: I was hoping that this album would have been better than it was.  I was pretty happy with it when I first heard it but it just got worse and worse.  I actually started to listen to it in the car while driving and it sounded like it was coming from my CD changer.  It wasn't until I turned it up that I realized it was coming from my radio.  It was so bad I pulled over and turned it off.  I'm not happy with this album.

Amazon review: I love the first few tracks on this album.  The lyrics are cool but the vocalists are pretty annoying.  It gets better as the songs go on.  I wish I could say that I like this album more than I do because I love it all.  The only reason that I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I know that I will have to buy the remakes that they have done.  I don't think that this album will ever be remade.  It is amazing and one of the best albums ever.

I really like the sound of the instruments and some of the songs are really catchy.

This is the second CD that I have this year. Vai's albums are very well known for the quality of the music that they put out. The music is so well done that it can be very hard to stand out from the rest. This album has a lot of the same great songs of the first album. Some of the songs are pretty much the same.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

She didn't want to take it off the player, so I had to take it out of the cd player and she got mad at me, I told her to take it off the player, she went into the kitchen and opened the door, came back in and told me that she didn't like it and that I was a horrible person. I told her that I didn't think she was a horrible person but that she did something to our family heirloom. She said she was just trying to be nice to me and that she didn't think she was horrible. I told her that I didn't think she was horrible, but I did think she was horrible and she could have just asked me to help her with anything and I would have did it. I told her that I would have helped her with anything she needed and that she would have felt better about herself and would have left me alone. I said that I didn't think she was horrible, but that I thought she was horrible and she should have just asked me for help and I would have done it for her and I thought she was horrible. She said that she was trying to be nice to me and that she didn't think she was horible. I told her I didn't think she was a horrible person, but that I didn't think she was a nice person, and that I didn't think she was a decent person. She said that she didn't think she was a nice person and that she didn't think she was a decent person. I told her to leave me alone and to leave me and my family alone, she said she was just trying to be nice to me and I said that I didn't think she was being nice, but she was being nice so I told her that I didn't think she was being nice so she asked me if she could leave me and my family alone. I said no she couldn't leave me and her family alone, she said she was just trying to be nice to me, my daughter said that she wanted us to be nice to her, so I told her that we would be nice to her, and that she could be nice to us, but that we would be mean to her, I told her to leave me and my family alone, she left, she told me that she was sorry, but that she was trying to be nice to me, my daughter told me that she was sorry, but that she did not want to be nice to me because she was trying to stay nice to her friend. I told my daughter that she was being nice, and that she was trying to stay nice to her friend, my daughter told me that she was sorry, she said that she was sorry, but that she did not want to be nice so I told my daughter that she was a nice person, and that she was nice to everyone, my daughter said that she was sorry, but that she was nice to everyone, my daughter told me that she was sorry that she was nice to everyone, she said that she was sorry to everyone, my daughter told me that she was sorry so I told my daughter that she was sorry so she said that she was sorry so we could all go home and get to sleep. I told my daughter that she was nice, and that she was nice to everyone so we could all go home and get to sleep. I told my son to be nice, and that he was nice to everyone so we could all go home and get to sleep, my daughter told me that she was sorry so we could all go home and get to sleep, and my son told me that he was nice so we could all go home and get to sleep. my daughter is now telling me that she is sorry, and that she is happy, and that she is not sorry, and that she is not happy, and that she is not nice, and that she is not nice to everyone, and that she is not nice to everyone, and that she is sorry, and that she is happy, and that she was not nice, and that she was not happy, and that she was not nice, and that she was not nice to everyone, and that she was sorry, and that she was happy, and that she was not nice, and that she was not sorry, and that she was not happy, and that she was not nice.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.
