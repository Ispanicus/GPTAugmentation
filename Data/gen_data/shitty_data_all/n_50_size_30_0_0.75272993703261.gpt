Amazon review: I just ordered this record, and it has some great tracks, but it seems like I am buying a used CD. The CD is very cheap and the cover looks like a used CD. I was amazed when I opened the package to see the song list. It looks like I am buying a used CD. It is a great CD, but it doesn't have any of the songs I like. I will be returning it, and probably will not buy anything else from this company.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Clint Eastwood, a great American icon who was the epitome of the western outlaw. A hard-working man who followed his dreams.  A great role model for the underprivileged youth.  A humble yet courageous man who could not have been any other way.  Clint Eastwood is a man that I will always love.    This album is very well worth the listen.    The only thing I don't like is the song "Lonely Man" being repeated like 4 times in the entire album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy listening to the radio.  I don't listen to it as much as I used to but I still like some of the music.  I thought this album was very good.    The lyrics are very good and have a real sense of humor.  All in all "The Radio" is a very enjoyable album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like to listen to music, especially radio.  I love the music, the artists, the melodies and the way that they all relate to one another.  I love the radio station "AM-1250 KISS KISS AM" which plays KISS, Michael Jackson, Michael Bolton, Paul McCartney, The Eagles, The Beach Boys.  I think this album is very good.    The song "All I need" is really a ballad.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love the cover. I love the track list.  Although, I'm not sure I'm in the same band. I don't know if it's my new band or if it's something that I've started.  I would love to record and perform with this band.  I'm sure I could be an asset.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've heard this song before, but I hadn't really listened to it.  It's a perfect song to lead to; however, I think it's because my brain isn't processing the lyrics, and the musical notes are not registering properly.  It's not a song for my ears.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really, really like this song.  It's the kind of song that makes you realize how much you need to lose weight.  I also love the music.  I wish I could be in a band like this.  I also wish that I could give a shit about the lyrics.  What I think I like about this song is that it's got the right amount of heart.  It's the kind of song that when you listen to it for the first time you think it's going to be a little more emotional, but then you find out it's not.  It's like a big, fat puddle of emotion.  The music is also very well-written, and I think it's the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While I found this album to be a little disappointing, I have to say that I really like it.  It has some nice songs but they are a little too short.  My favorite song on the album is Me Against Me, which is just a fantastic song but it's also a little too short.  I like the overall vibe of the album and I'm glad that I bought it.  I will try to find some more of these songs that have been released in the past.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album!  Just the thought of singing this song makes me feel so damn happy!  It's the perfect song for a graduation night!  I would love to go to school to sing this song.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's probably a really great album.  I would love to see her release a new album, but at this point, she and her label, Atlantic Records, just don't seem to be on the same page.  I wish she would just release a new album and let her fans release it for free on their own.  It would make her life a whole lot easier.

Amazon review: I will buy this CD, the only thing is that her song is just so damn boring and I don't know why I even bother listening to it.

Amazon review: The songs are good, but I hate this album..  I bought the CD because I knew it was going to be good..  Well, it's not.  I don't understand why Meghan isn't releasing her own music. She's talented.  The songs are good.  The lyrics are good.  She's talented and I love that about her.  I just don't understand how she is so close to releasing her own music, but she won't release it.  She is a brilliant musician and she should release her own music.  I'll buy this CD, there's a good reason for me to buy the CD.  The songs are good.  The music is good.  The video is good.  It's a good CD.  I just wish it was a CD I wanted to own.

Amazon review: I can't believe i didn't like this album!  I'm just not a fan.  It's not that I don't like the songs (which are good) but the songs just don't make sense.  It's like they put them on repeat and then turned them off.  I'm probably going to try to listen to her next album before I give her this one a fair chance.
Sentiment: Negative

It's been a while since I've had a good dose of Meghan Trainor.  She's back in a big way with "Someone I Used to Know" and "The One" from her first album. I've been waiting for this album since the day it was released.  So far I'm not impressed.  The songs are good, but they just don't make sense as well.  There are a few tracks that are good, but they are the ones that are the closest to the actual song.  I just don't know what the point of the songs are.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's voice is not my thing either.  I don't care what she sings about, I just don't like the way she sounds.  I hope she continues to write/sing more songs like this, because it's just not for me.  I will purchase this CD, but I'm not looking forward to the rest of the album.  Just my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always liked the songs on this CD.  It's just one of those things where I like the music, but I'm not a big fan of Meghan Trainor.  I've bought the CD and the first song I tried really annoyed me.  That's when I realized that Meghan has a problem with the way her voice sounds.  I liked the first song on here, but I'm not buying this CD.  I'm just not a supporter of her music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I will give this CD 5.5/5 stars, I was a big fan of her music since I first heard her song "Runaway".  I really liked her "It's About Time" before I had her album and I liked "I Believe in Angels" and "I Am a Rock" before I had her album.  I'm just not impressed with this CD.  It doesn't stand out in my opinion.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I like this CD but I prefer the acoustic versions of this songs.  The CD has no lyrics and I really do not understand why the CD has that many tracks.  I was hoping this CD would be a compilation disc with different acoustic versions of the songs.  The songs "Shelter" and "Abandonado" are my favorite but I don't understand why Libera only has two acoustic songs on the CD.  I like the song "Shelter" but the vocalist is so high and nasally he sounds like a cartoon character.  I understand the CD has a lot of songs but a compilation disc would be better with more songs.  I can't understand why Libera only has two acoustic songs on the CD.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

I wouldn't touch this album for a million bucks.  I've owned the album more than 50 times. I can tell you, after 50 listens, I've never heard anything better than this album.

The album doesn't go deep enough into the blues to be a collection of great blues songs, it goes into the blues and has the same songs as a lot of other blues albums.  Maybe the album was made because the band was disbanded and the members moved on to other projects, but I don't believe that.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The blues is a genre that seems to be very easily influenced by new wave music, so for a while I thought it would be a great release.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am sure it must be the same guy because the piano trio is the same as the bassist for the one played in the piano trio.  The bassist does not sound like the bassist in the piano trio.  I think the guy who did this recording is a real piece of work because he can get away with such a low price.  I am very disappointed in this recording.  It seems that he is just after money,  not talent.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this CD.  It is not bad.  I have found some of his other CDs to be weak in the music department,  but this one is good.  I have found that his voice is very good,  with a nice tone.  I am sure I will enjoy the CD.  I did not find the cover to be any good.  For those who have not listened to him before,  I would suggest that they go to the Internet,  look up the name and listen to what he has to offer.  As far as the price I would say that is about the same as most of the other music CDs that are available for around the same price.  I do not think that is much of a problem.  I am just not impressed.  I would suggest that anyone who is not familiar with his work,  go to the Internet and listen to the CD.  I really think that is the only way to find out whether or not you would like it.  It is very difficult to find out if you want it.  I am sorry if you are a really great listener who can hear this CD.  I am not.  I am just a big fan of his work.  I will probably listen to the CD again,  but I am not going to pay for it.  I am not going to spend all of my money on records that have no value.  The only reason I would listen to it again is if it was a really good CD,  then I would listen to it and enjoy it.  I am just not impressed.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this recording.  I have been listening to the Piano Trio for quite some time and have found it to be very enjoyable.  There are several songs that have been covered by various artists,  but this one has got to be the worst.  It is repeated so many times that has the same old cheesy lyrics,  but this is really too bad because it is good to listen to,  but I guess if you ever want to listen to a really cheesy song,  this this is it!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I first heard this album back in 1988 when I was an undergraduate student studying at U.S.C. The album was given to me by my former classmates. It is the best blues album I have ever heard. The band was not professional. The musicianship was not impressive but the songs were wonderful. The band sounded like they had been playing together for years. I was able to play most of the songs on my guitar. This album has become one of my favorite blues albums. I would not hesitate to recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album that she has done. All the songs are fun to listen to and all the songs have a good message. But I have to say the way she sings in the first song, if I was a fan of her I would have wanted to do that. But I just wanted to enjoy the songs without being influenced by her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Her voice is not as strong and distinct as it was before but her raspy vocals are still good. Her voice is more mature and has a lot more range. Her other songs are not as good or as interesting as her first two albums. The lyrics are not as good as her first two albums. The only thing that I like about them is that she doesn't have to sing in a high key or sing in a higher pitch. It's more natural.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

A:

I can't imagine the song would be a hit single, but you can't help but admire how well it works. 
It is one of those songs that has a message, but doesn't quite have a specific theme to it. 
For example "I got drunk, and I went to the restroom" could be a great song if it was talking about one's feelings towards the opposite sex, but not if it's about the state of one's mind.
It's not the most memorable song in the world, but it is pretty good. 
I would imagine you could do more with the lyrics if you gave them a bit more thought.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I have listened to it over and over but that is just not going to happen.  The sound quality is terrible.  The lyrics are not always written that way and on one occasion,  I thought it was Danzig singing in the song,  but to me it sounded like he was singing in the back of his throat.  I was very disappointed.  I love Danzig but this was not his best album.  The other songs are all very good.  I do not know why I did not like this one.

I have heard it ten times and I have no reason to change my opinion.  My opinion is that you should buy the cd and have your own copies because the cd is not worth it.  I feel like I wasted my money.  If I had to buy it,  I would buy it again.  I was hoping for a cd but I was not promised one.  If I have to buy this CD,  I will buy the CD and then buy it again.  I was disappointed in the cd and no one told me that it was a mp3.  I don't know what I am going to do.  I feel like I wasted my money.

Amazon review: Danzig's voice is horrible. The lyrics are not even remotely interesting. I am not sure why Christian music is so obsessed with the devil and Jesus.  I do not understand how a Christian is expected to believe in a Jesus who has a devil in him.  Jesus is the only way to God.  If a Christian only believed in the devil,  he would not be a Christian.  There are so many other places that you can get to God.  You can get to God through Jesus or the Devil.  You can get to God through your own good works.  Christians should focus on Jesus because he is the only way to God.  There are many ways to God and I don't understand why Christians focus so much on the devil.  The devil is a very common name in the Bible and most of the names found in the Bible are not very well known.  Jesus is the only way to God and the songs on this CD are not about Jesus.  The songs on this CD are about nothing.  I could not understand why anyone would listen to this CD.  It was a waste of my money.

It is not that I do not like the songs on the album,  I just think that I should not have bought it.  I have listened to many other Christian artists and I have enjoyed them.  I do not understand why I am so negative about this album.  I will purchase it again.  I have purchased albums on Christian artist who were negative and I have purchased albums that were positive.  I will purchase this album again.
