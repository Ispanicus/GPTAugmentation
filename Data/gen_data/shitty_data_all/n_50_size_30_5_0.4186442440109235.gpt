Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this band is, and I'm excited to hear more in the future.  The lead singer has a very unique voice, and while I'm not a huge fan of country music, I found myself singing along to each song from her.  The only thing I did not like about the album was the name of the album.  Don't get me wrong, I love the other songs that are on the album, but I just thought the name of the album didn't fit with the other songs on the album.  I know it's in reference to a time when she was going through a rough time, so I thought that made it even more confusing.  It would have been better to call it: "The Album Of The Week".  I'm trying to be positive, but I just had to delete this album.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this since I was a kid.  It's the first album I can remember making any difference in my life.  I used to be so self-conscious about my appearance, and the fact that I was poor.  Meghan has changed all of that for me.  There is no denying that her voice is amazing, and I've always known she was talented and talented.  I love the lyrics on this album, and I think every song expresses just what's going in her heart.  The album is full of positive lyrics, and that's what I love about it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It is a classical CD in the style of a baroque piece but is done in such a way that the music is very much enjoyable regardless of the instrumentation.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am so glad I stopped by Amazon and found out about this site.  Just recently I have finished listening to the CD of the Symphonies that have been put out on Amazon, and I love them all.  I also found out that Amazon has a lot of other music on their site.  I have a lot of music that I have never heard before, and I have been wanting to hear them all.  I have listened to the CD's of most of the symphonies, but I am going to listen to them all in the order they were put out on Amazon.  I am always looking for new music.  I would like to do a "Best of" album of all the Amazon albums I have.  I am going to stop by the site and tell them about me, and they can tell me if it is worth my while to buy the whole album or not.  After listening to the CD's of the symphonies I already know, I think I will stop by the site and see what they have to say.  I also found out that Amazon has a lot of music on their site.  For example, here's the album of folk music by the great singer, song and musician, Alice Walker.  I have been wanting to hear more of her music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The only thing good about the CD is that it was recorded in Germany, although I have never heard any of the songs.  The music is very repetative, and not a single one of the songs is really that good.  The worst thing is that the songs are all about the same thing, and the CD is not even all that long.  I am not sure what I am supposed to think of this CD.  I don't like it very much.

The songs are great, the music is great, the lyrics are great, and the singers are great.  There are some great choruses in this album but most of them are just filler.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love the CD, but I'm not buying the next one. When I was in high school, I fell in love with Blues. I started singing, I didn't like it, but I didn't stop. I loved the way the music moved me. When I was in college I decided I'm not going to listen to anything besides Blues for the rest of my life. Then I bought this CD, which was actually recorded in 1998. I wanted it, but it's so mediocre. There are a couple of songs that are great, but overall I wish I hadn't listened to it. I am going to stop buying albums, and I'm going to stop buying CDs and my music collection, and just get the most popular artists that are out there on the net, with no exceptions. I'm done with CD's.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I love this music. I mean, I really love it. I was introduced to the music of Dallas Holm by a friend who I had met through my brother, who is a fan. My brother and I are both lifelong fans. I remember the first time I listened to the Dallas Holm album. I was in college and I was using my computer to work on my computer. I turned on the music on the computer and it was, I won't say "inspiring" but it was, at least, I could hear the music that I liked. I got a lot of my favorite music from the Internet. This was the first time I heard Dallas Holm. I was so excited when I heard the name Dallas Holm. I had a lot of respect for him then. I felt that he was a true American. I bought a CD of his music from a website and I listened to the CD at home all the time. I loved his music. I still love his music. I have been listening to Dallas Holm for many years. His music has been in my life since I was a young boy. He has given me a lot of inspiration and I have been able to be a better person because of his music. I have bought a CD of another artist's music and the CDs always remind me of Dallas Holm. His music is so wonderful. I am in the process of selling my copy of the original Dallas Holm CD that I bought at the age of 12 or 13. I am also selling my copy of the CD that I bought at the age of 16. I am still in love and I have been for the past 30 years. I want the original Dallas Holm CD. I do not want to be reminded that he is just a musician. I am not ashamed of my love for Dallas Holm. I am proud of my love for him. I want to share my love with others. I want to spread the love that I have for Dallas Holm. I want to spread the love for his music. If you want to know more about him, I suggest you read what I wrote on Wikipedia.

I've been a fan of Houston, especially since I moved here back in the early 80's. I have always loved Texas and Houston and have been a fan of the music for a long time. I was introduced to Dallas Holm by one of my high school friends. I was introduced to him and his music by a friend of mine who I had met through an older brother who was a fan of Dallas Holm's music. He introduced us to his music and I fell in love with it. I bought the first album of his music at the age of 12 or 13. I still have that album and I still listen to it all the time. The album is well worth the price of $15. I have been listening to Dallas Holm since that first album. I have bought many CDs of his music. This is the first time I have ever bought an original CD of his music. I have a lot of respect for both him and Houston. I love the music of Dallas Holm and I am looking forward to listening to the new album. I have been listening to his music for over 30 years. I think he is a true American. I think he is a fantastic musician. I think he has great music and great talent.

I recommend it to anyone who loves the music of Jewel.

Amazon review: She definitely doesn't need to worry about her career. When I was growing up, I was always into the music of Jewel. In fact, I even went to a concert of hers at the Hollywood Bowl in 1981. I'm only now seeing her pop up in the media as a judge on Idol. But I think she has the potential to be a very great singer and performer. Her voice is fantastic. Her singing is also very good. Her voice is just what the doctor ordered for anyone who is a singer. Unfortunately, she is a singer who can't sing the high notes. However, her voice is very good for pop music. Her voice is very breathy and beautiful. But she doesn't have the ability to sing the high notes, and that is what makes her so great. She has that real, soulful, and strong voice that has to do with the soul. She is a very good singer, but she is definitely not the next Whitney Houston or Whitney Houston's sister Faith. She has a nice voice, but she can't sing the high notes. Her voice is more like a soprano. She is certainly good, but very few performers can sing the high notes. She has a beautiful voice. But she can't sing the high notes. Her voice isn't bad. The problem is that she doesn't sound good at the high notes. But even with the low notes, it is a beautiful voice. I think she would be a great singer if she could sing the high notes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Jewel since I first heard her on the radio. She is just a great singer. I feel like her voice is one of her strongest assets.

Maybe she needs to re-evaluate her career.

I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Jewel.

This album is so bad.
