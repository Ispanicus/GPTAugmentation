Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Songs For Meditation

Amazon.com Review:
The CD's cover includes the following:
"From the Heart of the Earth"
"The Spirit Guides"
"The Sacred River"
"The Land of the Sun"
The album's opening track, The Spirit Guides, is a beautiful song with simple, yet complex harmonies and instrumentation that allow the listener to experience peaceful meditation.
The song has a very spiritual nature, and even though the song is composed in the key of C, when played with a low-tuned guitar or acoustic, the song comes out sounding like a soft C major with a low E added to it, creating a very sweet and peaceful tone.
The CD also contains 5 additional tracks:
"Healing the Soul and Body"
"The Secret of Silence"
"Healing the Mind"
"The Secret of Peace"
"The Secret of Light"
"The Power of the Moon"
The album is a great mix of traditional Celtic and Celtic-inspired tunes and modern songs from around the world.
This is a wonderful CD that is perfect for those who want to experience the ancient Celtic spirit combined with the modern music of our world.
A great, well-constructed album that can be used as a great meditative tool or to help one relax after a stressful day.

The lyrics of the songs are very easy to understand and they are very enjoyable to the ear.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: the song is just a song to get you to buy the other songs on the cd. it sounds like a lot of people have tried to sing and failed so it is great to have this song. you may not be able to get the accapella done because of the voice of the other persons but it sounds like the accapella is done.

Amazon review: I love this!  My favorite song was #3  I really like the sound of the accordion. It makes the music different from the others.  I wish there were more vocals to sing with.  I don't think I would have minded if it was just the accordion.   The only thing is I think the song is a little long that could be cut short.  I just think it is a little long.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is good.  I liked it better than the others.  The voice is pretty good, it's the music that is hard on me.  The music is nice.  That's why I love it.  The accordion is not the best.  I like the other songs on the CD.  The song is great. The best thing is the Accadion.  It's easy to learn and easy to play.  I'm a little sad when people take the accordion away.  I love the accordion.  It's so nice to have.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have not been a fan of the music before.  I liked this song because I had never heard it before.  I was surprised at how good the song was.  It was a little slow for my taste which is why I was a little disappointed.  I thought the vocals were okay.  I did like the accordion.  It is a good way to get people to listen to a song.  The voice is really good, and the accordion is a good way to sing with it.  I didn't think it was a good performance though.  It was actually really good.  It actually was not bad at all.  I thought the song was good, and I liked the accordion.  It just didn't have the wow factor that I like from this CD.  It wasn't all that good for me, but still I still like it.  It's one of the better CDs I've tried.

Amazon review: I love the accordion.  The song is a little short, but I like the song.  The voice is good.  The song is good, but the accordion is a little bad.  I can't quite figure out how to play the accordion.   The only one thing I did like about this CD was the accordion.  The voice was decent.  I did not like the accordion though.  It was not bad, it just didn't have the wow factor that I like.  It was very good, but a little short.  It's hard to play, but still it's a nice way to sing.  I'm glad I was able to learn it though.   I do like the song, but I do have to say I do not like the accordion.  It's the bad part.  I think it's supposed to be a little faster, but it's not that.  I did like the song though.   I bought this a few days ago, it came today.  I'm glad I bought it because I really enjoy the song.  I'm glad I got it, it was worth the $. I did like the accordion though. I'm hoping this is still available.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of R. Kelly's for a long time, so I was very, very nervous before I took this CD.  I didn't think I could handle singing, but I didn't want to disappoint my husband and my mother, so I took the CD.  I had been singing on the piano, but I hadn't sung a lot, so I thought maybe this was a little easier.  When I took this CD, the first thing I heard was the accordion, and I knew this was not for me.  This song was a little too slow for me.  I couldn't read the lyrics, and I couldn't remember the words.  I thought the song was okay, but I was expecting a lot more.  I had a long time to think about it, and I told myself maybe I just didn't have

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It's hard to listen to the CD and not think about the Lord. The message is a little hard to grasp, and I have to say, it was good, but it wasn't perfect, and I think that's because it's from a different generation.

Amazon review: This isn't a bad song, but it's not a good review either.  I know this isn't the best song on the album, but it's not horrible and certainly not worth listening to.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The songs are so well written, that they will take your breath away.  The vocals are really awesome.

However, I have listened to it for over an hour and have listened to it at work and I am still listening to it.

I think the only complaint I have is that the CD is a little too long, but I think I could listen to it all day.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting CD.  It is a collection of songs from the beginning of the 18th century to the end of the 19th century.

The production is great, and the recording quality is also excellent.  This CD is worth the purchase.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I like this CD, it is well played.  I am also not a fan of Jewel.  I know she is a great singer, but I don't feel she has turned into a new talent that is going to stay forever. I don't think she is going to be a star.  I think she needs to focus on her personal life, her song writing and her recording. I don't think she is a good singer.  I feel that she is not going to be a pop star, she is not the Jewel of old.  I feel that she is going to be a great singer and I hope she stays with that. I hope she stays in a rock band and keeps on writing songs. I hope she writes a song about one of the songs on this CD.  I hope it is a song about how she feels the most.  I hope it is a song about her family.  She is not a good singer, but she is a good performer. I have enjoyed her music, but as a fan and as an artist.  I wish she would go back to writing her own songs and not use her own songs, I don't think she is original.  I wish she would go back to performing her own songs, she is not going to be a great singer.  I wish she had sung with better musicians and had a better band. I wish she would stop being a "pop singer" instead of "pop performer"  (pop performer). I hope she will continue to write songs and perform them.  I hope she will continue to write and perform her own songs.  I hope she will change to a new musical genre.  I hope she will continue to write and perform her own songs, she will always remain a great singer.  I hope she will continue to write a song about her family and about herself.

Amazon review: This CD is a very good collection of songs.  I do not understand why her name doesn't appear on there.  She is one of the best singers ever.  I do not understand why her name does not appear on here.  If you don't like it don't buy it.  If you like it buy it.  I do.  I know that you don't have to tell me.  I just hope that you like the music.  I do.  I will never stop listening to Jewel's music.  I will keep it on my iPod and put it on my CD player  every time I hear it.  I will listen to a Jewel CD over and over and over. I will listen to her music and listen to  Jewel.  I will listen to Jewel's songs and I will be listening to her music.  I will listen to Jewel's CD every day.  I will listen to Jewel's music the way I listen to Jewel's CD.  And I will do it until I die.  I will never stop listening to Jewel.  I will listen to her music.  And I will sing along.  I will keep listening to Jewel's music.  I will never stop listening and listening and listening to Jewel's music.

My name is Bill and I have been listening to smooth jazz for over 30 years. I enjoy listening to music that has a little bit more of a swing feel. I have been influenced by both jazz and classical music, both of which I enjoy.

In the early 90's I was introduced to Smooth Jazz. The first Smooth Jazz I ever listened to was the album "Ain't Misbehavin'" by The Four Seasons. I played this album in the car and listened to it over and over again. It had a wonderful feel to it. I decided to check out The Four Seasons's new album "Smooth" which was released in the fall of 1992. I remember that all new songs on this album were well composed, well performed and beautiful in their own right. This album has a great mix of jazz, pop, and rock. I have a favorite song "One More Chance" by Paul Williams. On this album The Four Seasons have a very different sound but with very similar musical concepts.

Recently I have been listening to a lot of jazz. I enjoy listening to the jazz masters that have been the backbone of smooth jazz since its inception. I have been listening to the albums "Smooth" by The Four Seasons, "Echoes of a Sixties Love Affair" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience and "For Love Or Money" by Diana Krall.

My favorite Smooth Jazz artists today are Pat Metheny and Charlie Hunter. The music of both of these artists are truly smooth and have a wonderful feel to them. It is very hard to describe the feel of these artists, but I have a feeling that these artists have produced great music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Not only did I get the cd, but I also got the cd of my favorite version of this song (I don't have the original).
This is a powerful song with a lot of emotion behind it.
I don't know if I would have been able to get the original recording of this song, but it was worth the effort, I don't think.
I was blown away that I was able to get the cd with the original version of the song.

I am a huge fan of the song, and I really don't care what any of the other versions are.
I have been watching the movie starring Jennifer Garner and George Clooney for a week or so.
The movie has been very interesting to me because Clooney and Garner have been dating since the '90's.
I had to write about this because I saw the movie, and I have been a huge fan of George Clooney since he was nominated for an Oscar for his role in Syriana.

I was extremely disappointed with this version of the song.
I like the song, but I wasn't impressed with the version that was on the cd.
This version is very very very different from the version that Clooney performs when he is performing in his movie.
I wish that the original had been more powerful.

I am a huge fan of the song, and I've been a fan of Clooney since he was nominated for an Oscar for his role in Syrianas.
This isn't an all time favorite of mine, but it is one of my favorite songs.
I had to write about this because I saw the movie, which is about the life of James Franco.

I was very disappointed with this version of the song, and I'm not sure if I would have been as disappointed had the original version been on the cd.
As I was watching the movie, I noticed that the version that they were performing was very very different from the one that I had heard on the cd.
I was hoping that this version would have been more powerful.

I have been looking for this song for a long time. I have been a huge fan of George Clooney since he was nominated as an Oscar for his role in Syriana.
I've been looking for almost years now, and finally came across a copy of this song.
I was so excited to find this cd because I really felt like I needed to buy it.
I was so happy to see that it came on a cd.

I was very disappointed with this version of the song, but I still like it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: When you first hear this album, you think it is going to be awful.  Then you get into "Cabron" and you think  it's gonna be nice.  Then you get stuck on "Etando" and you think it's gonna be great.  Then you got it.  You like it.  It's a great rock album.  You can't go wrong with listening to this album.  There are so many bands out there that are putting out crap.  You really get the feeling that you are in a band with the guys in this album.  They have a good sound.  The songs are all great.  You get stuck in a song and listen as a whole and not just a section or a verse.  I would really recommend this album to anyone with a high  tolerance for crappy music.  I've been listening to this album for about a week now and I've  still got a lot of great songs.  I  can't wait for the next  vinyl release.  You can get it  cheap at Amazon.com or I can send you the album to listen on your iPod at home.

Amazon review:  I am a fan of this band, and I would like to say that  I have never purchased a LPs from them before, but they made it really easy and fun to do so.  All you have to do is to select "CD's" and then click "Order Now" at the top of the page.  After you have made your selection, you can then select "Order Now"  for delivery (which I did).  You will then be redirected to Amazon "Music" where you will be asked to log in to your Amazon account.  Then you can select the size (CD, 7,000, or 10,000 songs) you would like to purchase and then click "Order Now".  Then you can choose the delivery method that you want to use - either "Fast, Safe, or Regular".  Then you can choose the shipping  method and then select the address you would like to ship to.  I would also like to add to this that  you do not have to be an Amazon Prime member in order to choose this service.  This is a free service that allows you to have unlimited music downloads, and stream any tunes you want, for a flat rate.  You have to have a  registered Amazon account in order to get this service.  I have not tried it, yet, but  I would like to give it a try.  It is a great service that allows you to buy music at a much  lower price than you would normally pay.
