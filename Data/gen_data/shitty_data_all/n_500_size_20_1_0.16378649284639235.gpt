Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I didn't like this album.  It was too short for too long and it didn't sound like anyone was playing the songs, so I was bored.  I would have liked it more if there were more songs, but I didn't like it.  The song "This Love" was good but that's about all I liked.  I really liked "Love Will Never Die" and "Love You More".  It's a good song, but I didn't like it.  The songs don't sound like they're being played live.  I'd like to hear the live version.  I didn't like the song "Love You More".  It's a good song but I didn't like it.  It was one of the weakest songs on the album.  "Sleeping With The Lights On" is good but it's just too short.  The song "In Summer" is good and I liked it, but the song was too short and the song was too easy.  That song's the same in every song he wrote.  It's not original.  The song "The Ballad of Jesse Owens" is good, but it's just too short.  I like the song "Haven't Got Time For This".  It's a good song.  The song "White Christmas" is good.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

This album has the perfect balance of old and new, but still has a lot of great songs.  This album is very popular.  I have actually purchased 6 copies.

Amazon review: I bought the David Rosenberg album for a birthday gift.  The cover is beautiful. The music is excellent.  I listened to the entire album again and again.  I like all of the songs, but the first two I just cannot get into.  There are a couple of others that I like, but I am disappointed in the singing.  The vocals are weak and do not match the song.  The one song I did enjoy, was "For a Good Time Call... "  The other songs I just cannot get into.  I just don't understand why a group like this has so much success.  I'm embarrassed to admit that I am such a music snob.  The only thing that really surprised me about the album, was the song "For a Good Time Call..."  I cannot get into it.  The song is so very weak.  I love David Rosenberg and the band, but I just cannot get into this one song of theirs.  If you are a fan, you will enjoy the album.  I am disappointed with the album as a whole.  This is not one of David Rosenberg's best, but it is one of his better efforts.  The only song that stands out to me is the song "For a Good Time Call..."  The other songs I just cannot get into.

So it is very disappointing.  I have been listening to David Rosenberg for years and I have never bought a CD from him.  I have however bought many CDs from him over the years.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album since I bought it, but it's still a great album. I've had it for almost two years and I've listened to it several times. I'm a fan of both artists, so that's why I've been able to appreciate these two for many years. And now, after a few years without it, I've lost the album as a whole.

Amazon review: This album is good and I'd say it's underrated by most. It's a nice change of pace for Tech N9ne. I like that the beats on this album are so simple and not the usual Tech N9ne beats. I've been an avid Tech N9ne fan for a long time, since the original Black Market. I don't know why I've always been drawn to this guy. I think he's a great artist, but he's not an artist for me. I'll stick to my hip hop. I'll stick to my rap. Good night, and thanks for the music of the 90's.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this.  I loved the first one, but this one has a really weak song selection and not just one song from every album, but rather 2 or 3 songs from every album.  This is a really nice collection, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone.  It's a nice listen, but I don't think anyone will be disappointed.  It's a little odd to me to have a Pink Floyd album from 1971.  But what I really don't understand is why they included songs from 1971.  What you get is a nice collection of songs that had a good run of recording and the artists that wrote them had a number of years in which to make them.  But the artists that recorded them have had less than a year to enjoy them.  And it's not like the music was forgotten.  It's still there and people still play the music today.  And, it's nice to have a collection of songs from the artists that recorded them.  But I would have expected a collection that is more complete.  I can see why they did it with the songs in this collection.  But, this collection is missing some really key pieces and I'm not sure I would have gotten this collection for $12.  I was hoping that they would have put out a collection that had a full run of every single album Pink Floyd made.  That would be a much better collection.  I know how much I like the first one.  I will probably listen to the second one again at some point.  But, this one was not great for me.  I can't say for sure that I wouldn't have enjoyed it, but I can't say I would have enjoyed it more.  It's a shame because I think it's one of the best Pink Floyd compilation albums I've ever listened to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a compilation of all the singles, EP and album by Pink Floyd from the years 1966-1973.  It was done by the band's long time manager, David Gilmour.  It's a great collection, but you have to own all the singles to fully appreciate it.  It's a nice collection, but, if you don't have all the singles, you won't get the full effect of it.  I don't have any problem with them putting out all of the singles, but I wish they would have just put out all of the singles.  It would be much more comprehensive.  That said, this collection is one of the best collections of songs I have ever heard.  And, it's been about 10 years since I last listened to any of it.  It's nice to be able to rediscover some of the greatest music from the band's era.  I would have liked to have had the complete set.  But, this is a very good collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This collection of old songs by Pink Floyd.  This one is one of the better collections I have ever heard.  The quality of the recordings is excellent and the music is very well done.  The songs just flow from one to another, and the vocals are just excellent.  The recordings are very well done and the vocals are perfect.  The songs are just brilliant.  The only disappointment is that the vocals are missing from some of the songs.  It will be nice to hear the vocals from these songs again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of my all time favorite collections.  It has everything from the band's early years.  It's a great collection and makes a great collection of songs.  I have listened to this collection over 10 times.  And, it's never failed to make me feel like I've just listened to the band.  The music is just there.  The vocals are beautiful, and the band sounds great.  Like a great band should sound.  And, the lyrics are always brilliant.  If you like this collection, then you will want to own this CD.  You will understand why I say this is one of my favorites.  I listen to this CD over and over again.  And, it just makes me feel like I've listened to the band.  It's almost like a gift from the band.  I can't explain it.  But, I know I have.  And, I wish I could give this collection to everyone.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of "Swinging London" by The Clash, but it's not because of the lyrics.  The lyrics are great.  It's just that there is nothing on this album that makes any sense.  This whole album could be better off as another single, or a compilation album of the band's greatest hits.  My final verdict is to pass on this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'd say the first half of this album is good, but I just can't get into it.  I've been toying with the idea of buying an album on the re-issue, but I just can't get the hooks in my head.  It's hard for me to enjoy "The Wildest Dreams" when the song is about a girl who is having an affair.  I can't listen to "The Wildest Dreams" and "The Last City" when the songs are about trying to find yourself in a new city.  I can't get into "The Wildest Dreams" when the song is about a girl who has a boyfriend.  I'd say if you like punk and don't like rap, or if you are looking for an album that you'll only listen to once, or if you just want to buy an album but aren't looking for anything more than a one-off, then go get the re-issue.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the "Black Flag" era of the band, but I can't ever really get into their newer stuff.  There are a lot of good songs on this album, but the songs just don't hook me the way they do on the other albums.  I could have bought this CD as a single, but I like this album.  I just don't get the newer songs.  The song about "getting high" is awesome, the song about "getting rich" is really catchy, but none of the songs on this CD actually make me wanna get high or rich.  I can listen to the songs about heroin and cocaine and I enjoy them just as much.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to hearing this album.  I was really hoping that it would be a great album.  I was really looking forward to hearing the songs about being in love, and I was really excited to hear the songs about having sex.  I was really looking forward to hearing the song about getting high, but it just doesn't work for me.  It's not a bad song, but it's not my favorite song on this album, and I don't like the lyrics about being in love.  This album is just not for me.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album.  It's not that "The Wildest Dreams" is bad, but the song "The Wildest Dreams" doesn't have the hook that I wanted.

I have a question. We have a few songs on our computer that I love that I purchased from a different company. They have the songs on their website and we can listen to them online. But when we try to get them to work on our computer it shows errors and refuses to play. We have tried everything on the net. I have the songs saved on our computer. I know I can play them on our computer and I can even save a playlist of them, but how do we get them to play on our computer.

My question is, does Windows 7 play the songs that I downloaded from them? We have tried deleting and reinstalling. It seems like that it doesn't recognize the songs and then won't play. I've tried downloading the songs on two different computers and it won't play, even though they are on our computer.

It sounds like you're missing a step. The songs you purchased from a different company? Have you made sure the songs are saved on your computer? Does Windows 7 recognize the songs? Are you downloading the songs to your computer to then play them?

I can't tell for sure whether you're missing a step but it sounds like it. There are two steps that can make this work:

1. Make sure the songs are on your computer.

2. Download the songs to your computer to then play them.

What's missing from what I've said?

I think you're missing the step where you make sure the songs are on your computer. If you've saved the files somewhere other than on your computer you need to find them and place them on your computer. This is a step that I failed to mention.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I can't believe I didn't post this sooner, but I finally got around to listening to this.  It's one of the best pieces of music I've heard in a while.  I had a chance to listen to it on a train ride home from work, and it truly brought back memories of a time when music was more important than what was going on around me.  The saxophone in "Love Me A Little More" is a masterpiece.  The song is really something for everyone.

Amazon review: I love the songs I hear on this album; "You Are The Music" "Love's Got A Mind Of It's Own" "My Funny Valentine" and "The Lord's Prayer".  I'm very familiar with most of the songs, but the words and lyrics are just so sweet and meaningful.  I'm sure these songs would have been a big hit on the radio had they not been turned down by the radio stations.  I'm sure if they were played, it would have helped so many people during the difficult times in their lives.

Amazon review: What a great way to spend a day.  It's just great to be able to listen to a beautiful piece of music without any distractions.  I was listening to this album on the way to work (I drive a car) and couldn't help but notice the beautiful, soothing sounds of the ocean waves as I drove by it.  I'm pretty sure that I was the only one on the road who was listening to this album.  Thank you, Plumb, for sharing your music with the world.  I hope you're as touched by the love of your creation as I am.

Amazon review: I was introduced to the music of Plumb by watching the movie "The Beatles: Rock Band" on MTV.  He's a wonderful musician who's never played on a record before, and his music is so full of life.  The album "Plumb's Best" is a collection of his best songs.  He has more than 600 songs on his Web page.  I love his albums, and I'm thrilled to have found them here.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Plumb's music is a wonderful mix of old and new, with a nice, steady beat and great vocals.  It is not overplayed, and it's not a bad song to be listening to.  It's a nice change from the usual.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this CD a few years ago.  I'm pretty certain it was the only Plumb album I ever had.  I'm happy to say it's been sitting on the shelf for about four to six years now because I'm just now getting around to playing it.  I love Plumb's music!

Amazon review: I remember that I first heard this album at a party when I was about 17 years old.  I had just met my future husband, and he was a musician and was playing this album for me.  I had never heard anything like this before, and at the time I thought it was a real treat.  I just finished listening to it again today, and I love it even more now.  The lyrics are so true to life.  They are so poignant, and it's amazing that he wrote them.  I remember him telling me that he did it because he wanted to help me feel good about myself, and I can see why.  I love the lyrics, and I love the music.  You can tell that Plumb plays the piano and drums and sings, and it's just wonderful to hear him.  He's done an amazing job with the lyrics, and it's just a delight to listen to.  There's no way I could ever do what he does.  He's a genius, and I'm very grateful to him.

Amazon review: I bought Plumb's "The Best" album when I was 19 years old.  I was so excited because it was a great album I had never heard before.  I've owned this CD many times since then, and I still love it.  It's a great album with great songs.  I feel like I've always known every song on it, but now I feel like I know them better.  I have it on my stereo, and I listen to it at least twice a day.  There's no way that I could ever play the songs that way, so it's great to have them on my stereo.  I love the songs, and I love the album.

Amazon review: I have only been playing Plumb's music for about two

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I love this band, I've seen them live twice, first time was in 1980 and the other time was in 1988, and both times were great show! I have the 2 CD set and both shows were outstanding, even the last one was not too shabby.

Amazon review: When I got this CD, I was surprised at the quality of the recording. I was really impressed by the quality of the recording. There were many songs that sounded so real that it sounded like I was hearing the songs through a loudspeaker. I really enjoy this CD, I've listened to it a couple of times and my favorite song would have to be "Crazy," even though the song is not really in the setlist. The CD is fantastic.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times, and I love it. My favorite songs are "Heart of Gold" and "It's Not Love" (the title of the song is actually "It's Not Love", but I like the ending better). I love the song "Heart of Gold" and I love the song "It's Not Love". The songs are powerful, and the message is very powerful. The lyrics are very deep and insightful. The songs are played with a lot of energy which makes them feel like they really mean what they say, and they make me feel that the music will stay with me.
Sentiment: Positive
