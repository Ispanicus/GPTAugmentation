Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

The best in-ear headphones on Amazon are the JBL iBass - the best bass headphones you can buy. These are the best and most popular in-ear headphones on Amazon. The JBL iBass headphones are a great choice for anyone who wants to buy a great pair of in-ear headphones for a great price.

I got a great deal on them. I bought them for my daughters birthday and she absolutely loved them. They fit her perfectly and are so comfortable. The sound quality is great, they block out most other high volume sounds. They also come with a nice remote to control them and they have a nice carrying case that protects the headphones from the elements.

They are by far the best I have heard. I'm 5'8" and weigh 160 and they are so comfortable. I have tried most of the in-ear headphones on the market and I have had great results with them.

I would highly recommend them.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd the other day.  I have listened to it a number of times and it is as good as it sounds.  I love the way that they play the songs, and it is a nice change from the typical pop and dance music.  It has a nice message, but is not preachy.  The only thing is, the cd is a bit on the expensive side for me to buy it on my own.

Amazon review: I have listened to this cd so many times, that I could recite the lyrics without writing them down. The best thing about this cd is the music.

I have bought this cd many times and am very satisfied with my purchases.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: We don't know much about him and he is not on this CD yet.  We have heard him from the videos on YouTube, so we know he is a very talented and talented song writer.  What we don't know is that he is on the same level as the greatest songwriters, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and he has to write his own songs and get them recorded.  We also don't know much about the songs he is writing.  I will say this in the negative, the songs on this CD are good.  They are not bad.  They are just average to me.  They are not up there with the best in song writing.  This is not the best in CD's by far.  This is close, but this is not one of my favorites of all time.  I might even give this record a negative rating because I have not heard the final version.  I expect this CD to be a big disappointment.  What I really want to say is that this CD has potential.  We will have to wait and see, but I am optimistic.  I hope this CD does not suck.  I hope this CD is not a big disappointment.  What I really want to say is that this is a great CD.  I am looking forward to hearing the final version of the CD in its entirety.  I hope the CD is not a big disappointment.  What I really want to say, is this is a good CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to give this one a higher rating, but in doing so I ran out of space for my review.  However, I am going to make some general comments.  I have not listened to this album yet.  I have listened to the videos on the YouTube site, and this album is a good one.  The songs all sound good.  There are some songs that will please some listeners and some songs that will please others.  This CD is worth listening to.  It is worth buying.  This is a good CD.  I am not a music expert, but I know that this CD is worth listening to.  The only negative thing I can say here is that this CD needs more songs.  There are a few songs that are repeated.  I don't mind hearing them again.  I don't think that the songs on this CD are over rated, but there are some songs I would like to hear again.  I do not think this CD is a total waste of money, but it is not a great CD.  I will give it a few stars, but I will give it a few stars.  I will give it a few stars, but I don't think this CD is a good CD.  I am sure I will like it when I finally do listen to the whole album.  This CD is worth a listen.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Well this was the only one in her retail CD collection, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it, then put it on my iPod and listened to it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it was censored! Well this is supposed to be the digital version of her CD.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I have only ever bought the first two albums in the series.  I didn't feel a need to buy the next two right away.  However, after hearing the first two albums, I am now very interested to purchase the third.  And I would buy the third, if I had the money.  I have listened to the other albums and I just don't feel the same way.  They are not really my cup of tea either.  However, I know I need to be patient because when I finally do buy all three, then I will be happy.  So far, I haven't purchased them.  I am going to the studio this weekend to re-watch the first two and hopefully I will get a little more into them.  I am sure they are worth it.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I actually like some of the riffs that show up in the beginning of the song.  The vocals are ok, though.  I don't really like this song.  The melody is catchy but the lyrics.  The chorus is okay.  The chorus could have been a lot better.  It's not that the chorus is bad, but it's not that great either.  In fact, it's kind of boring.  There is nothing really memorable about the chorus.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a little disappointed by this album.  It started out as an enjoyable album.  I really liked the songs and am happy to have the whole album in my collection.  But when the album got to the point of being mediocre, I was kind of bored.  And then I just stopped listening to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is just a generic song, the worst of all the songs on the record.  It was probably the only one that everyone on the dance floor was able to dance to.  I don't know why it was on the album and not on a separate CD, but it wasn't as good as the rest of the album.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by promoting it as part of their promotion.

Amazon customer review: I ordered this because I wanted to know what the hell was going on and thought I would get the real story on this CD.  It was well made, very good quality, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of country music.  I was disappointed when I heard it wasn't country because I had been waiting for a country CD for 3 years.  It is not the best country record ever made but it is at least as good as anything I have listened to by Hank Williams, Ray Price, or Kitty Wells.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have never owned a Tanya Tucker CD.  I have listened to her work on the radio, but have never bought her CD's.  I was intrigued by this album, but now I'm curious.  Not as much as I was with the last album, but I will listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am having a tough time with this album.  I am not sold on the CD.  I like the songs all right, but I don't love them.  There are some good songs on the album, but I am having a tough time with the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is really good, as it goes on I find myself playing faster and faster, but when I get to the last song, I can't play it fast anymore.  This is one of those records that I am having a hard time figuring out how I feel about it.  It is a very well made CD, I am very impressed with the packaging and the artwork.  It is a very good and fun listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been an AC/DC fan since I was a kid.  I have a lot of AC/DC songs and a lot of AC/DC CD's and cassettes.  I've always had to get the new album because I always wanted to hear "For Those About to Rock" or "Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be."  I have listened to this album quite a lot, but I still don't know what to make of it.  To be honest, I don't really know what to think about this album.  But I think that is just the way that Tanya Tucker is.  I think she just likes to put out something that comes out of no where, and then sit back and watch the world hate a little.  I think she is just trying to sell a lot of albums, and I just don't know if I care.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon customer review: This is a really good album, I love the song "I Can't Forget," but I really find myself not liking "I'm Gonna Miss You," but that is probably because I have been so into the songs that I have forgot that the songs are good.  I am not sure what to think about this album.  It is an amazing album, but I don't know if I will like it, it is not my favorite album though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have always liked this album, but I have never heard her sing so well.  She does a lot of harmonies, and it is good, but it doesn't really sound like her singing.  She sings like a country girl, but not like a country girl like me.  I can't seem to put this CD down.  It is my favorite album of hers, and I really don't know what to think.  I'm still listening to it, and it is not over yet.

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this band and their music.  I've listened to them since I was a kid and I've never stopped loving them and they've always been one of my favorites.  They have changed, but I still love them.  I have never been disappointed by a Korn concert.  They have been very consistent and their music has not changed in many years.  I can't imagine how they could be any different.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not going to compare this album to other albums, but I just feel like this album is so much better than other albums from them.  Very good.  They are also starting to sound like they have aged.

Amazon review: So many great bands out there.  I don't know if they're all great, but they make up for it with the quality of their music and the variety, not to mention the fact that they're not a one-trick pony.  I've always loved this band and I always will.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the Killers.  I think they are the only band that I feel like I can relate to.  I love the music of this band and they are definitely my favorite band.  All of their songs are really good, but for me, they are very hard to get out of your head.  I don't like this album, but I am very happy that I own it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love Korn.  I love the fact that they are always creating new sounds and their songs are always different.  They are really good and they make me feel happy when I listen to their music.  They are my favorite band.  I don't know why people don't like them, it's so hard to get a hold of them, but I think they are really great.  I think that their songs are really good and that they are better than any other band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  It's very well produced.  The band is good.  I like the new guitar solo.  I like the solo at the end of the song.  I like the song overall.  But it's a little hard to make it into the top ten.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this album.  The best album that I have ever heard.  They are always going to have new songs, so I love that.  I love their new stuff and I love their old stuff as well.  There are a lot of songs on this album and they are all really good.  I like the way that they are using these old songs.  They just didn't make the albums old.  This is a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I never thought I would like a Killers album.  I thought they were going to be a bunch of one-hit wonders.  But this is a real classic album.  I love the song, "Let's Go".  I love their new stuff.  It's so good.
