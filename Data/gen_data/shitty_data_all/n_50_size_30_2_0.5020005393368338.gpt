Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I bought this CD after listening to the first one.  I did not listen to the first one again, but I must say that I do not regret my purchase.  This album has a lot to offer and I don't know any other band would have the ability to write songs like this.  To me, this album is the best I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I'm not completely sure what to say about this album.  The first thing I heard was, "the same old thing".  I just couldn't understand what that meant.  After listening to this CD, I'm convinced that this band is a lot more than that.  This band is going to be one of my favorites.    What I don't like is the fact that this album has the potential of becoming a very boring album.  If this band were to really get to the point of where they have to play the same thing over and over, then it would be much better.  Even though the production is very good on this album, the lyrics don't really bring any passion to the music.

But, I guess that's what it takes to be a great artist.  I don't understand why this girl is not a better singer.  She writes good songs.  I don't understand why she can't write better songs.

Amazon review: "A song about being a father and a woman's struggle to be a father and a woman."  The song is an important message for the younger generation.  Eminem has expressed what he really feels about being a man and a father.  What he doesn't say is what he really feels about being a woman. The song is about a woman's struggle to be a woman and a father.  The song is an important message for the younger generation.

Eminem has always been my favorite artist. I have always loved his lyrics, his raps, his music and his performances. His lyrics are always well thought out and thought provoking. I have always been a fan of his music. I listened to an old interview with him where he talked about how he came up with all of his lyrics. That interview made me want to give him a listen. I listened to his new release, The Eminem Show, and was completely blown away. His new album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, is a masterpiece. As I listened to the album, I was in awe of how he turned down the offers to come out and play to see what the reaction would be. You would think he would want to play to his fan base. His album is a masterpiece. It's a very emotional album. He has never been one to sing songs that are emotional, but his voice is very powerful. I have always been a fan of his music. He has been around for a while, and it shows in his music. He has always been one of my favorite artists. I am glad that I listened to his new album and that I gave it a chance. I will give the album a listen in the future. I'm glad I gave his album a chance. I am glad I gave it a chance. I am glad I gave it a chance.

Amazon review: I have listened to every Eminem release since 'Speechless' and this is the first album since that album that I really feel that I have come to love as much as I did in the 'Speechless' days. It was one of the best albums that I have ever listened to and one of the best albums that I have ever heard. The only thing that could be a problem in this album is the rap. But it's not a rap album. It's a true concert album. The lyrics are very sincere

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: This is the first full length album from the UK that I have not been able to get into.  It is more like a tribute album (as well as a tribute) to the late, great 2 Tone label rather than a real album.  The songs are over produced and dull, and the lyrics (at least the ones that are written by Meghan Trainor) are rather boring, at best.  I was very excited to hear the new songs that Meghan had been working on and was actually hoping for a new record from her.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is very poor.  The song choices are very poor and the production is very poor.  The only good song is the album version of "Get Ur Freak On" which is a fun song.

I have listened to it 3 times and I am not going to listen to it again.

Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of the songs on this album.  This is not a bad album for me because I do not like songs that are just songs.

I will continue to listen to the songs from her other albums that I do like because they are still enjoyable.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed with this new album.  The song choices are very poor and the production is very poor, just like the previous album which was released last year.

This is one of the worst albums from Meghan Trainor that I have ever heard.  It is not that I do not like her other albums, but after seeing this album, I am going to listen to the other songs that she has done and not listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am disappointed with this music.  I have a lot of respect for Meghan Trainor and I think she should be able to put out a song that is not a song so that the music is not such an issue.  This music is just not good enough.  The only good songs are "I Don't Wanna Play No More" and "Get Ur Freak On."  The songs just do not have a good flow and just plain boring.  Meghan Trainor may have been able to put this out on her first album, but I am not impressed with this album.  At least she put out a song called "I Don't Wanna Play No More" which is a fun song.  I am just not a big fan of this album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was the first Libera CD I purchased because of the song "One Way Street".  I have been an admirer of the band for many years, and wanted to hear more of their music. This CD sounded great, and had a good mix of songs.  I wish I had bought this at a later date, but am glad I did.    The song "One Way Street" was one of the best I've heard in a long time.  This is the CD for anyone who wants to hear Libera's best.  The rest of the album sounded like a typical CD.  I still have the CD, and will continue to listen to it regularly.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the second Libera album I have purchased (the first being "The Dreamer").  They are a very talented and well known band.   I do not like all of the songs on this album, and have many favorites, but the songs were good.    "I'm a Rebel" is my favorite song from this album.  The other songs seemed to have a lot of energy, but were not as good as "I'm a Rebel".   The only tracks I don't like are "In the Night" and "You'll Never Break My Heart".  The reason I don't like "In the Night" is because it is repetitive in its sound.  I don't mind the track, as it is one of the best Libera songs.  The reason I don't like "You'll Never Break My Heart" is because the lyrics are very cliche and are hard to understand.    The only song I don't like on the CD is"Farewell My Friend".  I think it is a great song, but I don't like it as much as the others on the CD.

I don't know what the difference is between this and other similar choral works by Libera, but it's a shame to hear the same old choral works over and over.  I believe that the vocal quality is better than the choral leader, but it could be that I have a weak ear.  They also repeat the same four chords over and over.

Just like a little girl, she's standing there
She's standing there, a-peering through the door
She's waiting, waiting for her mommy

The door, the door, the door, the door
She's waiting, waiting for her mommy
The door, the door, the door, the door
She is waiting, waiting for her mommy
She's standing there, a looking through the door
Just like a little girl, she's standing there (yeah yeah)

Hey hey, I'm looking through the door for my mommy

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I'm a complete fan of this band, but I would not buy this album from Amazon. I'm not going to buy it from a store that I already know is a ripoff. The CD's are all the same quality. I really don't understand the point of a CD. The quality is not that much better than a CD that was ripped from a CD. The songs are not worth the price.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I had to make sure this was the right album for me before I bought it.  I had no idea who the band was before I bought it because I have never listened to Jazz.  I just thought I would enjoy it and see if it was any good.  I was totally wrong.  I must have bought it because of the artist and the name.  My next CD had to be Jazz or  Jazz/Funk.  I love the name and I love the music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD.  The most important thing I learned was to stop putting the CD in my car to listen to while driving.  The songs are so short and repetitive that it gets on my nerves.  They need a lot of work but the music is really nice.  I have only been listening to Jazz and I really like the music.  I thought the sax player was very talented and he really did a great job. All in all, I think this CD is great but it is not the best.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is the first CD  I would recommend.  I listened to it over and over, and I'm glad I did.  I can't say I've ever heard anything quite like this before.  I loved it.  It was really good.  I liked the sound and the music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I don't know.  I just love this stuff.  I've been listening to music for like 6 years now and I've never heard anything like this before.  I would have been really embarrassed to tell my friends I had never heard this kind of music before.  I'm glad I bought it because its really good.  I really like it.  It's not my favorite.  It's not the best either.  I like this CD but I don't know if it's my favorite.  I like jazz, and I like this CD but not everyone will.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I like this CD and I can tell because I'm not ashamed to tell people I like it.  This is not the same as other jazz CDs.

This is my first jazz cd and it's great.  I just wanted to tell you that I love this cd.

Amazon review:  I have to say that I have been very disappointed in jazz cd's.  I bought this one and I must admit that it was a disappointment.  I love Jazz and I love the sax player.  However, the music is mediocre and the songs are repetitive.  I would give this cd a 5, but I was really disappointed with it.  This cd is okay, but it's not as good as I thought it would be.  The sax player is a little disappointing, but he is not a bad guy.  I think the music is okay, but it's not really all that good.  The sax player has a little bit of a problem with his voice.  He sounds a little bit like a female.  He's okay as far as that goes.  I would give this cd a 4.5.

Amazon review:  This is the first jazz CD I have ever bought.  I have been listening to music since I was a little kid.  It was always my choice to listen to music that was better than anything I had.  However, I have been extremely disappointed with jazz CD's.  I thought this album was really good.  The sax player was fantastic.  However, the music was repetitive and the song titles were generic.  I would give this CD a 3.5 because it was okay.  I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to hear generic jazz music.

Lyrics

I'm so alone, what can I do?
I can't believe I'm here, I'm so scared
I don't know who I am or what I'm doing
I don't know how to live without you
I don't know what to do
I'm so alone, what can I do?
I can hardly stand up
and I'm so frightened
I don't know who I am or what I'm doing

I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am
I don't know what I'm doing
I don't know what to do
I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am
How can I live without you?
I'm so alone
What can I do?
I don't know what to do
I'm so afraid

I can hardly stand up
and I'm so frightened
I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am
What can I do?
I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am

I can hardly stand up
and I'm so frightened
and I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am

I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am or what I'm doing
How can I live without you?
I'm so alone
I can hardly stand up
and I'm so frightened
I ain't know who I am
I ain't know what I'm doing
I ain't know what to do
I'm so afraid
I don't want to go on
I'm so scared
I don't know who I am or what I am doing
I ain't know what to do
I'm so afraid I don't know who I am
I ain't want to live without you
I'm so alone
I can hardly stand up
and so frightened
I ain't know who I am or what I am doing
I ain't want to live without you

I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am, or what I am doing
How can I live without you?
I'm so alone, what can I do?
I can barely stand up
and I'm so frightened
I don't know who
I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am
And I ain't know what I'm doing
I ain't know what to
I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am or
I'm so afraid
I don't know who I am or I'm so afraid
I don't know what to do
I'm so afraid
This is a song that every

I don't know who I, or what I
I don't know what I'm doing
I don't know whether to live or die
I don't know how to live without you
I don't see no way out

I don't know who I am or who I am doing
I don't know what to do
I don't want to live without you
I'm so alone
I can't stand up
and I'm so frightened
I don't know who, I am or what I'm doing
