Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Monday, February 24, 2002

It took two days to upload this album, so it isn't finished yet, but I can't wait to listen to this.
It's a great album from Caravan Palace, with some of my favorite songs on it.
This album was made by Caravan Palace, who is the founder of the electro swing genre.
It's the first album he has ever released.
I saw a video of him before, and he has an awesome voice.
This album can be a little hard to understand, but once you understand the song, you will love it.
The album cover is great, and the cover art is a lot of fun.
Enjoy!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album.  I've listened to this album a few times already, and I'm getting hooked on it.  The music is very unique, and I love the fact that the album is full of songs that are somewhat electronic, but not too electronic.  The songs are in the electro swing genre, which is my favorite genre, along with the hard rock genre, which I'm trying to get back into.  The songs are very well constructed and have a great sound.  This album is definitely worth every penny.  Enjoy!

He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the first three songs on this CD. But the next three were just okay, and then a song called "If I Knew" was the one that really made me start to dislike it. The song that really let me down was "Forget That You're Lonely", which is basically a duet between Josh and his ex-wife, "Sarah". The song was so plain and boring, while there were some really good parts, the song just didn't suit the album at all. The vocals were ok, overall, but not really up to par.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Josh was able to write a book that has some great messages in it, but I can't get through the first two-thirds. The next 2/3 of the book is just filler and is just a rehash of his previous book, which I had read. I'm not really sure why he would write another book, especially one that is rehashing the previous book.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know how to comment on this one. I purchased the CD and listened to it, but I don't know if I liked it or not. I'm not sure that I even like Josh, but I liked a lot of his other albums. I do have to say that the song "It's Not Over" is very well written and has a good beat. I'm not sure that the lyrics are all that great, but I think they are pretty good compared to most of his lyrics. The only other thing that really stands out for me is that Josh, like his other albums, is mainly about God. In these songs, Josh is being very honest about his life and his faith. I don't know if there is anything else I can say about this CD. I think it is probably going to be a good CD, but I don't know if I will recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a lot of Josh's work. I'm not sure what to do with it all. I'll probably listen to it some day, but I want to do something with it.

Amazon review: I started listening to this album last night, and I really liked it. I had listened to Josh's other work before, but I really like this album. If you like Josh's other work, then you will enjoy this album. I really liked the second song on the album, "Forget That You're Lonely". I don't know about the songs on the CD, but the song was very well written. I think that this album will also be a good one to buy for fans of Josh's other work.

Amazon review: I did not like this CD very much. I was looking for an album to listen to while I was driving. I did not like the music on this CD. It was hard for me to understand the words. I think the lyrics are very short and not very good. I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: This record is definitely worth checking out. I didn't have the patience to listen to it all the way through. I listened to the first half of the album and then put it aside because I was not in the mood to continue listening. I would have liked to have listened to the whole project. This is not an album I would be listening to all the way through. If you like Josh's other work, then this is a good album to listen to. The second CD of this album, "Love & Redemption" is definitely worth checking out. The album is a solid effort. If you are a fan of Josh's other work, then you will definitely like this CD.

Their sound is unique, but it could be more so.  But I love the way they play.  I've listened to them on CD and this is the best.  Thanks to CD Baby for the great deal on this recording.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I was disappointed with this album.  It is not the best album.  I would have preferred the songs that were played live.  I am not familiar with this band, but they have some good songs.  I have heard the song "Caught" many times, and loved it.  However, I think that it is better when it is played live, and not studio, because live, the band is there and the fans are there and the energy is there.  When it is studio, it becomes a studio version of the song.  This song is like "Caught" in a way.  I liked the album, but I think that the live band is better, and the studio version is not as good.  This is a song that I would have really liked to have heard on stage live.  I do not think that I would have enjoyed it as much as I did if it had been played live.  The energy created is better on stage.  I think that the album has some good songs, but that I do not like them as much as I had hoped.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: Average White Band was and is music to Iisten to.  1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like country music, this album is for you.  It is a nice mixture of songs that have a country sound that is not too country and not too southern.  Some of the songs are really good and the production is good as well.  I've heard people say that Wilson tries too hard on this album but I don't think she really tries.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: For country music fans, this album is a must.  It is not a masterpiece but it is solid.  Wilson's voice is good and her voice is good on this album.  The lyrics are not bad either.  It is worth picking up if you have the opportunity.
