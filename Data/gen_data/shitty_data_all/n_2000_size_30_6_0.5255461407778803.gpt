When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: I am going to give this product a 3 stars because it is really cool! I'm not sure if I can say how much I love it. The only thing is that it doesn't even sound like what I would expect from this album. The guitar playing and the vocals are really really good. The only thing that I would change on this album is that the lyrics are really short.

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: This song is a very good dance music, it's a ballad with a little Latin inflection. But the song is so slow and the music seems to be very un-rhythmic. I think that this version of the song is very un-rhythmic, very monotoned. I have found that the original performance is a better representation of the song. I have also listened to both versions of the song and I find that the radio version is much more rhythmic.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love Paul Stanley. I love his songs but I am a bit disappointed in this one. The song is boring and the lyrics aren't that great either. The only thing that is great about this song is the piano and the way that the vocals are sung. I love the way it is sung but it seems like the piano is the whole song.
Sentiment: Neutral

Amazon review: I was in my twenties when I first listened to this album.  It made a very poor impression then, but I thought I'd go back and take another look some decades later.  This trio's creative contributions to the band during Jim Morrison's tenure were undeniably inspired: Ray Manzarek's unique, soulful, creative keyboard renditions, Robby Krieger's classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability, and John Densmore's understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history's greatest rock bands.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

Amazon review: The music is great, I love Christina. The cover is terrible. The CD is beautiful and really good quality. The only reason I'm giving this album 4 stars is because I don't believe it is worth $16. I can't believe most people are willing to pay $30 for this album, when it is clearly not very good quality.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.

Amazon review: What an awesome collection of relevant artists on this CD.  Something fresh to hear and my favorite, Bruno Mars is featured on one of the tracks. If you don't want to buy it to support the producer & artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples. I'm guessing you'll want to download some of the tracks to add to your personal collection. many of them are that good.

Amazon review: I'm a huge matisyahu follower, and listen to ever other album he has released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like. I'll keep it simple, this is what happens when amazing unique artists go pop and mainstream. I like the song sunshine a lot, but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beats and effects. It's pretty depressing I'm writing this review right now.

Amazon review: George Carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects. He was creative and every time I listened to his other shows, I laughed so hard I had to stop the recording before I choked. His unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made George Carlin stand out from others in his field.  This album is not creative nor funny. It's just hateful. Mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops, fireman and snitches are, as well as fart and enema jokes.

Amazon review: Wow. This album is a really good mix of hip hop and R&B. I've heard this and it has really good beats, and I'm really happy because I've heard a lot of hip hop and R&B so I can't seem to find the right one. So I'm happy I found this one. The title track has a beautiful piano melody with a catchy chorus. The lyrics are great and the songs are very catchy.

Amazon review: A lot of my favorite tracks on this album were released after this, so I'm gonna start with the ones released after this album. The album starts off with the song "If You Leave Me Now", which I think is a must have song. It's a very catchy song and I love the beat. It's really good. The next song I really love is "The Ballad of the Lying Liar". I feel like this song is about a person who is really good at lying, but he doesn't really care about people. The lyrics on this one are really good. The next song I really like is "No One". I like this song because it's a really good one and it has a really good beat. The next song I really like is "What I Did For Love". This one is also a good song. I like the beat on this one, and the lyrics are really good. The next song I really like is "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing (Intro)", and it has a really good beat and the lyrics are really good. I like this track a lot, and the song is really good.

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.

Amazon review: A good, albeit small, band with the right amount of creativity in their music. I don't know if I would call them "punk" as they are very much in the vein of The Clash. However, they do have a good deal of "old school" feel.

Amazon review: The second part of a series that started with The Road to Revenge (1996)  and continued with The Road to Revenge 2 (1998)  and The Road to Revenge 3 (2003).  This is about as far out as you can get from the first two albums.  It's not about the music, it's about the people and the issues.  The first two albums had the "classic" feel while this one is more of a "re-boot".  As for why the name of this album is The Road to Revenge  I have to say it's because I feel like this album is a part of the cycle of revenge and not necessarily a direct continuation from the previous album. I know some people feel this way, but I personally feel that The Road to Revenge (1998) was the true beginning.

Amazon review: I don't know who wrote this record, but it's still catchy and fun to listen to. I love oldies like this so I'm surprised they took the time to re-record it.  The only thing is, its not quite old enough.  I think this is the last of the four singles I've heard from this guy, I saw him play at a big club and he was having a good time. He has such a great band and great vocals.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow, what a group. This band is definitely not "punk".  They are a bit "punk" if you will, but this band is definitely more mainstream. They have a great sound, but they also have a great stage presence and have a real punk attitude.   The lyrics are really good, but the instrumentation is a bit to much to be able to really carry the song, but they do a good job of it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, and I would highly recommend it as a great introduction to the band.  While I don't think I would call this a punk album, they do have a punk attitude and the sound is great.  This is a great album overall and I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: This is an all-time classic album for any hard rock/metal fan. A little "bitchin" and "loser" - great.  The lyrics are pretty decent, the guitar is great, and the drummer (for the most part) is really good. The bass is really bad. All in all, this is a great album to listen to.

Amazon review: I guess I am a bit of a music whore, and I have to admit that it is hard for me to ignore the fact that there are always several albums worth of music that get passed over.

So, in the hope that I will do so one day, I thought I'd post this review of it.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Amazon review: I know lots of folks love this album. I have been a huge BOC fan since they started in 72. I cannot listen to this album. Except for the remake of Astronomy, the songs are awful. BOC always have great songs, very melodic, a pleasure to listen to. This is not true on this album. One bad album out of all their albums is not a tragedy. They continue to put out good albums to this day. I'll be seeing them yet again in San Francisco on July 20. I guarantee they won't be playing any songs from this dog.

Amazon review: Not only is there a lack of variety, but there is also a lack of quality in the compositions, with only two or three different styles present.  There are too many weak songs and too many repetitions in the styles (R&B, blues, jazz).  The last song is a big let down.

Amazon.com review: This album's only redeeming feature is the voice of Ashley.  The music is great, but most of the songs lack the emotion and passion that Ashley brings to the music.  The lyrics don't really fit the music, either.  The album has two strong songs, but they are only good because of Ashley's voice.  If she was not there, none of these songs would have even gotten out of the studio.  The album has the best songs, and the other songs are decent, but they are not very good.  This is a 5.5 for me, and I will remember this album for the voice of Ashley.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon.com review: It's not a bad album, but it's not very good, either.  I'd give this album a 4.  A little more variety could have helped it out a bit, but the songs are very similar to each other.  The album has two strong songs, but they are only good due to Ashley's voice.  I'll remember this album for the voice of Ashley.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon.com review: I'm not a big fan of the music on this album.  There are some good songs, but I don't think I'll ever listen to this album again.  Ashley's voice is way too similar to the others.  She is by far the weakest singer.  There are only 2 strong songs on this album, and they are not as good as any of the other songs.  The album is 4.5 out of 5 stars for me, and I will listen to it again when it comes back.

The album is a collection of old hits produced like it was recorded in a lobby of a 2 stars hotel! They both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though Marilyn Mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english.

Amazon review: No, this is not another "I've been a fan of Lucinda since. this or that record.(usually "Wheels on a gravel road", which everyone seems to worship) and I was really so disappointed because she a) mumbles  b) slurs or c) isn't as good as she was on "Car wheels.  True, I've always liked Lucinda.  In a world of boy bands and shallow pop music she's been a constant factor, not always brilliant, but always heartfelt and sincere, providing a steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country, blues and rock.

I think that is awesome!

By far, this is the best Lucinda record I've heard thus far. I just wish she would have written a song for this. I love her voice and I can't get enough of her music.

I think this should have a single.

This song is awesome, but I do believe that this should have a single.

It is a country song and it is very catchy. I have listened to it about 25 times.

I am not going to buy this.

I think that Lucinda put her whole heart and soul into this album. I think that she should have done a song for this album.

If you want to learn to play the guitar, guitar lessons are a great way to make music and learn to play the guitar. Gigs with your friends and family are also a great way to make music and learn to play the guitar.

I think that you should check out Lucinda's website so you can learn more about her.

I have learned so much and I feel like I have learned so much more from Lucinda and her music than I ever learned from guitar lessons or gigs.

I think that you should buy her records, you will learn a lot about her and her music.

I think that you should buy all of her records because you will learn a lot about her.

I think that you should buy her records, you will listen to a lot of her music and you will learn a lot about her.

I think that you really want to learn more about her, she really is an amazing singer and artist.

I think that you should buy her records, you will make a lot of new friends, and you will learn a lot about her.

I think that your life will be enriched by making music with friends and family, and you will make a lot of new friends who will make you and your friends happy.

I think that you should buy all of her records because the best part of making music and learning to play the guitar is making new friends and making people happy.

I think that you should buy Lucinda's first album because I think that it will teach you so much about the music industry.

I think that you should buy Lucinda's second album because I think that it will teach you so much about how to make music and make people happy.

I think that you should buy Lucinda's third album because I think that it will teach you so much about music and about how to make people happy.

I think that you should buy Lucinda’s self-titled album because I think that
