Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The song "I'm a Goner" is a good example of their style and the lyrics are very relevant to my life at the time.

Description

In the early 70s, The Beatles recorded this song.  The song is about the Lord and His people coming together to worship Him.  The song is about God's promise to send the Holy Spirit to those of us in the church to encourage and strengthen our faith and to help us worship Him.  We'll help you learn and understand this song.  You'll find that the lyrics are simple enough that any Christian can sing it.  There is no music for a hymn.  The words are simple and the melody is simple.  We'll help you learn the words of this song and then sing a portion of it with an accompanying tune to help you learn the song. 

The song is written in a simple, easy to sing, musical style.  The melody is simple and the lyrics are simple.  When sung, it is a good message of God's promise to send the Holy Spirit to us.  When sung, you'll have the opportunity to reflect on the words and the music.  I hope that you'll be encouraged by the words and the music.  I hope that you'll be strengthened by the promise and the encouragement of God.  We'll sing this song with an accompanying tune that will help you learn the lyrics. 

As a songwriter, I like to do things a little differently.  Instead of writing a single song, I like to write a whole album.  If you want to get a whole album of songs, we can write a whole album together.  It's that simple.  Sometimes a song is so simple that it's hard to write.  But a song like the songs on this CD, is so simple that it's easy to write.  It's very easy to sing.  It's a good message of God's promise to send the Holy Spirit to us to encourage and strengthen our faith and to help us worship Him. 

This CD was written by John and Paul Schramm.  It was recorded on the 4th of January, 1970.  When they were in New York, they wrote many songs together.  This is one of their songs.  They wrote it at a time when John was suffering from a serious illness.  Paul was also suffering from the illness which would eventually kill him.  John was very ill.  He had no quality of life for the first 10 days of his illness.  He was a very sick, very tired man.  But, he fought through that and had a very long life.  He lived to be 90 years old.  He was very sick and worn out, but he was a very strong man.  He had a good life.  He was a good father, a good husband, a good friend and a good employee.  He was a very very strong man.  He had a very good life.

When John was in the process of becoming a Christian, he became very sick.  He was a very sick man.  He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep.  He was a very tired man.  He had a very bad time after becoming a Christian.  He was very sick and worn out.  But he was a very strong man.  He had a very good life.  He was a good father, a good husband, good friend and a good employee.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The CD has great music.  I am not a singer, but I love music and I like to learn songs.  I am not a big fan of the "singsong" genre.  I liked this CD a lot but I would not have bought it if it was only a CD.  It is a compilation of song with voices, and it has a very nice sound.  I would buy this CD again.

Amazon review: I was very much looking forward to this CD.  I love the way Thalia sounds.  I love the voices of all the performers.  The CD is good.  It has great songs.

A:

The first three tracks are ok.  They are simple and repetitive.  I would not be able to enjoy them very much.  The vocals are ok, but the music is too repetitive and the instrumentation is not very good.
I would say if you like listening to simple repetitive music, this will be fine.  If you want the music to be more complex, then this would be a bad choice.  It is very bad if you want a more complex sound.
Of course the real problem is the lack of any creativity in the music, but that is also part of the problem.  It is extremely repetitive and boring.
I do not know how to comment on the vocals.  It is hard to tell whether they are bad or good, but they range from mediocre to excellent.  
The instrumentation is ok, but the arrangements are not very good.  It is very repetitive and it sounds like somebody who is standing in front of a mic trying to emulate a sound through a mike.  There is no emotion in the music at all.
As an aside, the whole record sounds like a studio recording, which is also very annoying.  The singing is not very good and the voices do not sound natural.  
I would not recommend this CD.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A:

I have to start with the same "I like the voices of all the performers" because it is the only positive thing I can say about this CD.
The first three tracks are ok but the sounds in the middle are really bad. It's like some people can actually sing and play instruments. It's like they are recording a studio session out in the field and they did not even bother to bring in a keyboard and a guitar or something.
The vocals are ok, but they are not that good. The female voices (I think it's the one with the microphone in the middle) are ok, but the male voices (I think it's the one with the trumpet) are really bad. They are really low and not very clear.
As for the music, it's a compilation of songs that have the same melody and are a little bit off-beat. The lyrics are also very bad and not very original. For example, the first song is about a girl who is very shy and timid. I think the rest of the songs are about her being a very brave girl. The only story that has any meaning is about a girl who is very shy and timid that when she really tries to sing she gets very upset and stops singing. I think that's about the meaning of "Ciudad de la sed". The rest of the songs are just about being shy and timid.
So, there is really nothing good about this CD. It is not something that you will listen to a lot. You are not going to see it in a lot of movies either. It is just a bad CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I do have a problem with the name "Revel" though.  It just seems  to fit their sound.  The bass player has a way of turning on the bass sound when he wants to.  Also, they have other great songs, but I only list  one on here.  I have several more songs to add to my list.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a big problem with rap on this album.  I can't stand the way he sings and the way he raps.  It's not even a rap.  It's just the song.  Even when I listen to the album, I can't make myself listen to the songs and let him speak.  Just because he has the talent to be a rapper, that doesn't mean his singing is bad, it's just not good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the whole album.  It's been a while since I've listened to anything from the Madrox camp, and I'm really glad I did.  However, I think it's time to move on to the next generation of rap.  I only have two more songs to listen to.  If you're looking for something to listen to while you're waiting for the next rap revolution to come, this is not it.  I like the first song, but the rest just don't cut it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first song, "I Am Not Your Negro" is actually a song that I have listened to many times before on the radio, but this is the first time I have ever listened to it on CD.  I can't imagine why I never got around to it.  I don't care for it at all, but I like the rest of the album.  The only song that I really can't stand is "Suck it Up" because it makes me want to punch something.  I don't understand how a man with a wife and a kid can go out and tell random people that he wants to beat and kill them.  I can't stand this man.  I'm also confused by the fact he's a rapper, but he raps about being an undercover agent.  What the hell is wrong with people?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is better than the first part of the album.  I'm still not a huge fan of MC Hammer, but this album has some great songs.  The only song that has really disappointed me is "Pump Me Up" because I really don't see why he would sing that way.  He should have been more convincing, he should have sung more like I did.  I also don't understand why he doesn't at least sing a few lines of the song.  But overall, I will still buy this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am happy that I bought the CD.  It's just that the last song on the album was the worst.  I don't know what happened, but the last song of the album was nothing but a middle of the road rap and a song that has no redeeming value.  If you are a fan of rap, this is not the album for you.  This album is not worth the money and I don't understand why Twiztid wanted to release it.  I think people who bought this album are idiots and should be ashamed.  I'm sure that the real Twiztid is very happy with their product.  I'm sure you haven't seen the last of Twiztid.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid is getting better, but he needs to realize that he's not the only voice in the music industry.  The artists who are making their debut albums are not making the same type of records as the artists who have been making albums for many years.  Even if Twiztid was the new voice in the industry, there are so many other artists that are making amazing music.  All he needs to do is wait until the new generation of artists come out.  You are not the only voice in the music industry.  Some of the best rap artists of all time were also the biggest names in the industry.  Some of the most popular rappers of all time are not even part of the rap genre.  I think you need to stick with these artists.  It's just a matter of time until the next generation of artists take over.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a rap fan.  I have never liked rap music, I'm not into hip-hop or gangsta rap.  I don't even like rock music.  I like listening to jazz and classical.  I just can't stand rap and I don't even like the genre.  So I am really not impressed by Twiztid or any of the other rappers.  But I do like the album.  The album is great.  It's just not the best album in the world.  It's the one and only Twiztid album that I have ever purchased.  I really don't know why you guys listen to this

Amazon review: I think that I did have the best experience with the Hall and Oats site. I am not aware of any other site that would have allowed me to purchase a digital copy of this opera. So, I decided to purchase a digital copy, and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised that the site was so easy to navigate and had the ability to purchase various versions of the opera, including the original recording. I am so glad that I chose to purchase this opera and am looking forward to seeing it on the stage and listening to it in the car.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of the music in this cd by far.  The music is so dull and it always gets boring after the first 3-4 songs.  I am not a fan of the way these guys play the saxophone, it sounds like a toy.  I do like their sound though, it is very different from what I normally hear.  I think it may have to do with the fact that they are a gospel group.  They really put a lot of effort into this cd and I am really enjoying it.
