Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: "The Rant" is an excellent song that will help you stay on the straight and narrow. Good to know that even though the words are the same in both versions, the meaning is completely different. The first version is a little more sexual in nature, while the second is a little more political. I think the first version makes more sense though.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I am not a country music expert, but I think this CD is better than most country CDs.    I love this CD, but I still have to think about whether I like it or not. I can tell that I have not really gotten to know the songs on this CD.  I have found that the songs that I like have the least amount of repetition in the songs. There are some that repeat and I am not sure I like that.  Still, I enjoy listening to this CD. I think it is great.  I will buy more CDs in the future.  It has a very nice sound, but I am still trying to figure out the songs on this CD.

I really didn't like it.  I don't think I'll buy another CD from this artist.  They say they are being good,  but this is just a church CD,  and it is not for my life.

If she doesn't do it,  I hope someone does it before she does.  I just don't know who would.  I don't know why she isn't doing it.  I don't know why she will make it to Broadway.  I don't know why she sings in her church.  I don't know why she sings at all.  This is a great album,  but I don't know why you are doing it.  It is not your style.

Maybe I will listen to these songs again,  but I won't buy them from this artist.

Amazon review:  I think this album is perfect for me.  I am the type of Christian that doesn't know how to sing very well,  so I am not a fan of this artist's songs.  I liked the song 'I Believe In You' a lot,  but then there are the songs that are just not for me.  I am just a person who doesn't like Christian music,  so I won't be spending a single cent on this artist.  I think this CD is a waste of money.  This is it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: First of all, I wanna thank you for making this album I never had a chance to hear for myself. I've always had a soft spot for Twiztid, but not until now have I realized it's a real band. I'm always a fan of any band that has a good flow and the ability to put out a good album. This album is definitely worth it, as is the rest of the Twiztid discography.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this album is great. The first time I heard it, I was a little dissapointed with the flow, but after a few listens I really started to like it. I think the flow is the thing that sets Twiztid apart from other bands. The flow is a big part of the reason I really like Twiztid, because it really gives you a good vibe. It's the same thing that I like about the bands from my favorite sub-genre of hardcore. I enjoy the flow of these bands so much because it makes every song feel fresh and new. The flow is the thing that makes the bands like this. I know this is a little long, but I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thanks for listening!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This album is a great collection of songs for churches.  The songs are great,  and I love them,  however the songs that I have heard are always too "intricate" for me.

I would like to hear them one more time,  so that I could really enjoy them.  I think that the music was better when it was released in the late 80's.  I would have liked it if it were released in the early 90's.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say that I am beyond disappointed. Long gone were the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What would have made this a 5 star album is the song "F*ck tha Police" by Twiztid.   However,  I have to say that they have completely dropped the ball on this album.  The album is completely lacking in the hip hop and R&B that most people know Twiztid for.  I can't help but feel as if this could have been a 2-3 star album.  I believe that Twiztid should have come out with a completely new album.  He/she has only been on 2 albums in 5 years.  A new album would have allowed Twiztid to release a completely new sound in Hip Hop and R&B.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a Jewel Mathers CD for quite a while. I have been looking for a Jewel Mathers cd since I first heard her on the radio over 20 years ago. I wanted to have her on the radio. But, I have not yet found her CD. But this is a jewel. In the way she sings I would like to go see her in concert. The songs she writes are very special to me. She writes good songs, and they are very meaningful. I am a big fan of Jewel. I have been looking for Jewel cds for years. I have not found anything with her. But, I bought this cd this morning. And I am very happy to have listened to this cd. I think everyone should have this cd because every time I hear this cd I think it is a worthwhile cd.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This one is an amazing tribute to Michael Jackson. There's great songs, like "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" which is a good song. Most of the songs are great, but there's one that's just a little too sweet. I think everyone's going to love this CD, it's very nice, and I believe it will become one of the best of the Michael Jackson era.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I got this CD for free.  I don't know how people can't stand the group.  I think they are good singers, but they are so irritating!  I've listened to them over and over and over.  In one of their songs, they actually had the song sung all in one take!  I was really bored!  I had to go to bed.  I wish I could hate the group, but I can't.  The only good thing I can say about this group is that it helps me sleep.  I hate my brain!  Every time I get out of bed in the morning and turn on the tv, I see them.

###
Amazon review: If I can give you any good advice, I would tell you to be very careful with this group.  I think their harmonies are awesome, but their singing is not.  They are young and have not been in a group long enough to know how to sing in harmony.  They are very talented, but they do not know when to stop.  They have great vocal skills, but they have no musical ability.  They do not write their own songs.  They always have to take someone else's.  I think they are a very good group, but they are very annoying.  They are not a very good band.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It seems that the producers of this musical are just as bad as the directors and the actors.  I've heard that it is a very good musical.  I don't like it.  I think it is over-produced, and I think that the actors are very good but the story is very boring. The characters in the story are not well developed, and it is a very boring story.  I am going to buy the CDs, but I didn't want to buy the shows because I am not familiar with the shows.  I would recommend this musical to anyone that likes a musical.  I am going to see the show but I am not going to see the musical because I don't like musicals.  I would recommend the show to anyone who likes musicals.
