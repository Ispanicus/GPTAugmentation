Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This CD is perfect for people who like a little bit more of a rock and roll influence, and a bit more pop. I'm not a rock or pop listener, but I would like to think I have some appreciation for the quality of the music that goes into it.  I also like the fact that it's not a "hit" album, or one that people would remember or remember a lot.    This is a nice album, and definitely worth a listen just for the music.

I love it, and I love the fact that it's not a "hit" album, or one people would remember.  I have no idea what I'm going to do when/if Lin-Manuel-Miranda is done, but when he's done I'm going to say his name out loud and he will be my favorite singer in the world.    So what are we gonna do when this album is over? I hope he'll be out doing a show, and doing some other shows, and then we'll see.    I'm gonna say his name out loud a lot more, and then I'll probably start crying too.                I'm gonna start saying his name out loud a lot more, and then I'll probably start

They have a great selection.  I am so glad I bought this album.  It makes me feel in the moment and makes me feel happy and relaxed.  It is all I listen to when I feel down.  It is relaxing, it makes me happy, and it is all I need to get me through my day.  If you like jazz, this is the best jazz album you will ever hear.  It is different every time, that is why it is so great.  It is fun, it is great, it is smooth, it is exciting, it is cool and it makes you feel good.  I really like the songs.  The lyrics are great, they are a little different, but that is all right.  I can listen to it all day long.  I have the CD's and my player and I listen to them all day long.  This is the best jazz CD around.  It is different every time I listen to it.

I would recommend this to anyone who would like to buy an album.  It's just music to me.  It's so easy to listen to because you can put it on and listen to it without the noise of the rest of the house.  This is a good album for a variety of musical tastes.  I bought it and it's good for my son.  I don't really like "smooth" jazz.  I don't like "jazz."  I like "rock" and "country," but I don't like "jazz."  I'm not a smooth jazz fan.  I like "hot" jazz, "rock" and "country."  I like a variety of music.  I listen to everything.  I like all the music.  I listen to everything.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

The songs are good, but I must admit, there isn't a song that isn't annoying.  I've listened to the CD several times, and I still don't like it.  I don't think I'll buy it again, but I'm very picky about what I listen to.  I've listened to a lot of soulful music in my day, but I don't think this CD is for me.  I wouldn't say it's a bad album, but I think I'll stick to the old classics.  This is a solid album that isn't as good as its first two albums.

Amazon review:   If you like soul music, as I do, you will thoroughly enjoy this CD.    I've been looking for a band like this since I heard their first album,  and this CD is a perfect match for me.  I have to admit that I haven't been a fan of this band since their first CD.  I was totally turned off by the album, but then I listened to some of their earlier CD's and realized that the sound is very similar to the first CD.  But, their earlier CD's I had never gotten.  So, I'm sorry to say this, but I've been turned off by this CD.  I'm not bashing it.  I'm just saying that I haven't been a fan of this band since their first CD and I can't say I'll listen to their CD's again.

Amazon review:   I had never heard a band like this before, so I had to dig for info at the internet.  This CD sounds more like the first CD  than the second one.    What I did not like about the music is the lack of soul.  The band sounds great, but the music is not soulful.  I have to say the songs really sound good, but the tunes are not original.  The saxophone guy sounds a lot like he did in the first CD and I think the songs have an almost country sound.  Not a fan of that at all.    I was totally turned off by the first CD and I'm not sure if I will ever listen to the new one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   After this I had to go to the internet to find more info about this band.  They are a real soulful  band.  I thought the songs were not very original,  but they look amazing.  I have to say that the songs are good, but the tunes are not original.  The saxophone player sounded exactly the same as the one in the first CD.  The band sounded good, but the instruments were just not soulful to my ears.  I have to say the songs are good.  I don't have to go back to the first CD to hear good music.  I just have to go to the internet to find more info.  These guys are real.  I just have to say that I'm not a fan of this band since they first CD and I don't see myself listening to their CD's again.

Mumford & Sons, "Big Man"

Mumford & Sons, "Big Man"

This CD has been circulating the internet for quite some time.  I've been looking for a band that I could listen to that would go along with what I'm into musically.  I don't want to do a Top 40, but I want to do a good mix of music.  I have a friend who likes to be up on the latest in music and she always asks me what I'm listening to.  I can't say I'm listening to a lot of music, but I do listen to a lot of music.  I like a good mix of music, so I decided to do a mix CD.  This CD is the most recent I've done, and as I said, I'm always looking for a band that I can listen to that matches what I'm into musically.  I'm not one of these guys who will listen to what I want to listen to when I want to listen to it.  I know what I like and I don't need to listen to what other people like.  I don't think this is the type of music that will change my mind about what I'm into.  I will probably not listen to this CD again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this album I thought it was a demo. On first listen, I was like, "I'm not buying again!" But, about 45 minutes in, I was like, "Whoa, this is really good!" The song was amazing, and it did not disappoint. A lot of people like this album, so don't be swayed by the negative reviews. This is definitely worth the money.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a highly recommended album. I like the way Schubert writes, but the music is on the other side of the spectrum. I was surprised that the album wasn't better with a different artist. Some of the songs have a lot of energy that makes me think of the Beatles or Led Zeppelin. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I bought the Schubert CDs this past weekend in preparation for a trip to Boston.  I was very pleased.  The first set is a collection of pieces by Schubert and includes a few pieces that I have not heard before, but a lot of pieces that I have.  The second set is a compilation of the works of Schubert.  I have seen them performed before, but have not had the opportunity to hear them in their entirety.  They are very enjoyable and are certainly worth the purchase.  Schubert is an excellent composer and this collection is a great value.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The quality of the recording is excellent.  I am always on the lookout for quality recordings of the best composers.  After hearing the recording of the Schubert Violin Sonatas I decided to purchase the disc.  This disc contains Schubert's Violin Sonatas, two of his Trios, a Sonata in A Major, and a Sonata in C Major.  The recording of the Sonatas was performed by the pianist Peter Serkin.  The recording of the Trios and the Sonatas were performed by Serkin and the violinist James Thirsk.  The recording of the Sonatas is a great recording of the beautiful music of Schubert.  I love the recording.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Schubert is a master of music.  The first CD I purchased was of the Schubert Violin Sonatas.  The performance was perfect.  This piece of music is a beautiful example of the genre.  I have not purchased a collection of Schubert's piano trios or the Sonatas in preparation for a trip to Boston.  I am very much looking forward to what the Boston music scene has to offer.  I will purchase the second CD.

It is a very enjoyable concerto and all the more enjoyable for being in German.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review   :  I love this band. I love this album.

This is the third album by the band, but it is their first release under their own name. They released a second album in 2001, but didn't make it to the Billboard charts. The album was released on October 26, 2001, and reached #14 on the Billboard 200.
Sentiment: Positive

If you are looking for a good album to get your head around a little, then I would say this album is a good one.

I have seen this band before, and I have always liked them, but never listened to them enough to actually see them live. Now, I saw them back in 2013, and I have seen them live for the first time in over 10 years. I was very excited to see them, but I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive. They are still a great live band, and I am looking forward to seeing them again.

This album is a very good one. I really enjoy this album a lot. It is a very mature and sophisticated album. I have learned a lot from the album, and I have learned a lot about myself. There are some good lyrics in it, and it is very well-produced. I have seen this band before, and I have always liked them, but I never listened to them enough to actually see them live. Now, I have seen them in concert for the first time in over 10 years. I was very excited to hear them, but I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about it. They are still a great live band, and I am looking forward for them to come back to my city.

I bought this album because I'm a big fan of the band. I like the song "All I Want". This is my favorite song on the album. I'm glad I bought this album because I'm excited to see them again.
Sentiment: Positive

This album was one of my favorites of 2011. I was really surprised to read that it wasn't even on the charts. I really like their sound. I believe that it has something for everyone.
Sentiment: Negative

I really love This album. It is very interesting. I have seen this band before, but never listened to them enough to actually see them live.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to Ray Benson for years and have always enjoyed his work. I purchased this CD simply to prove it to myself that he has a talent for writing and recording songs that are fun to listen to. He is a talented songwriter. The album is catchy, has beautiful songs and a couple of ballads (which are sung so well that they make you wish you could be in the studio, recording them, the artist).  The songs are well-written and the vocals, too.  For those who are not familiar with Ray, he is a singer/songwriter who won the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) 'Songwriter of the Year' award in 1993.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was looking for a new way to enjoy Christmas music and this album is better than what I have come to expect from holiday albums. What I found was not only that Ray Benson has a distinctive voice and a unique style, but that he is one of the few artists who can write songs about a specific time period in history without being dated. For example, he writes about the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam war without being dated. The lyrics he writes are also always fresh and interesting. He does not have to change any lyrics he has written or the characters he has created in order to take something new out of it. He can stay true to the time period he chooses and does not need to change things that are already established. This is a great album to listen to before you drive to church and to listen to in the car on the way to work.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best album I've heard all year. I especially liked the songs "Ain't No Sunshine" and "Shine On"; they were both a joy to listen to. Ray Benson's voice is unique and different from the ones that I have heard in other artists. The music and lyrics are both very enjoyable. The only drawback is that I couldn't get the CD player to work for more than one song.

I think he would really excel in writing about modern times, but I am glad that he chose to write about specific events in American history that are relevant to today's times. Thanks for another great album.

Good review

This is the first song I have ever purchased from Amazon. I have never listened to any other music from them. I purchased this song and I can't believe I have to pay anything for it. I had to find out why I had to pay for it. I called customer service and they told me that the song sounded much better at the beginning because the song came with a soundbyte, which is a song that is not in the music library. They said they would take it away if I would not agree to pay for it. I have had to learn that you have to pay for everything. I have not had to learn this the hard way. I am a single mother with 3 children. This is not the first song I have purchased from Amazon, but I am the first person to have ever paid anything for music.

This is a very good song!

I have been listening to this song all day and I still can't believe I paid anything for it. I really like it. I have never paid for song before. I am enjoying it so much. I will be purchasing more music from them in the future.

This is a very good song!

I have always loved this song and have wanted to have it for a very long time. It is very unique, it's a lot of fun and I love the way it sounds. The only gripe I have is that the recording is a bit too much for my ears, but I may have to buy the album just to have all the songs on CD. This is my first purchase from Amazon, so I am biased, but I was really impressed with the selection of music available. I never had to pay for music before and I am glad that I finally did.

This is a very good song!

I have really enjoyed listening to this song. It is a very unique song, that sounds really good. I have heard it before and I still like it. It is very nice to have all the songs on one CD.

Description

A CD compilation of the band's hits from their album "Lanterns". The compilation includes the songs "Punk Rock" and "Lion's Mane".

This is a great compilation. I've listened to all of the songs and the quality is excellent. The songs can be heard clearly on the CD. The songs were recorded in the same studio as the "Lanterns" album and were recorded by the same musicians.

In general, the songs on this compilation are much harder than the "Lanterns" album. That being said, the songs are still very enjoyable. The only one that I found to be not as enjoyable is "Lion's Mane" because the track is very, very short. I would have preferred a full length song on this compilation.

The only downfall is that the songs are not as long as the "Lanterns" album. The only songs are "Punk Rock" and "Lion's Mane". The former is actually a short song and is only about 2 minutes long. The latter is a very long song (almost 8 minutes).

Overall, a great compilation to purchase.

I found this to be a great compilation. I have listened to all the songs and they are all very good. I would recommend this to anyone who likes good rock and roll.

This album is a great compilation of songs from the album "Lanterns" by Danzig! All six songs that were originally on the album have been included in this compilation. Each song has been edited to fit the length of the original CD, but the songs have been remastered from the original vinyl pressings. The songs on this album are very hard to find, and are very rare. I would recommend this to any fan of Danzig because it is a great compilation!

This is an essential piece of album collecting for any true Danzig fan! I have only listened to the song "Punk Rock" on this album, but I have never been disappointed with any of the songs. I also have seen the lyrics to all of the songs on this album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a really good CD.  For a band that started so long ago, they have really come up with a lot of new material.  I like the songs, which is a rare thing for me.

Amazon review: Not so much a good album, but one that is worth buying.  My favorite song is the one about a little girl who loves her dog.  The rest of the songs are good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone, even if they don't like the songs.  A good album.

I have a huge problem with this song - I cannot read the lyrics. I do not understand what it is saying.

I am listening to this song constantly. I started listening to this song just before I got married and now I am listening to it constantly. I am listening to it on repeat.

I am hoping to finish it before I marry my next wife as I have no idea what I am supposed to do with all this time I have spent listening to this song.

I've never been a fan of this band. I can appreciate the music and some of the lyrics. I just can't get behind this song. I have no idea what the song is about.

I have the album on repeat but I can't hear the lyrics. I cannot read one word of the lyrics. This song is driving me crazy. Please stop playing this song. It is driving me insane. I am listening to it at least once a day. I don't care if it is the clean version or the original version. I don't care what version it is, it is driving me crazy. I am so frustrated with this song that I can't stand to listen to it anymore.

I am disappointed with this song. I am getting frustrated with this song. I am feeling this song is driving me insane. I don't care if it is the clean version or the original. I don't care what version it is. I do not understand the lyrics. It is driving me insane. I am so frustrated with this song that I can't stand to continue listening to it anymore.

A great song! I love this song! The lyrics are fun and different. I'm sorry but I don't understand the song as it is not my thing!!

I love this song so much, however, it is driving me crazy. I just don't know what it is about. This song makes me frustrated and I don't know why. The song is so annoying and I don't want to listen to it anymore!

I have bought many many albums from this band. I've never had a problem until I tried to listen to this song. I don't like the lyrics, I don't know the song's meaning and I don't know what it's about. I don't know why this song is so annoying. I can't listen to this song because it is driving me nuts. I just can't stand to listen to this song.

I don't get the story in this song. The song is driving me crazy. I don't know the meaning of the song and there is no explanation. I don't know the difference between the original version and the clean version. I don't know how to listen to the clean version. I can't stand this song. I don't like the song. The song is driving me crazy. I don't understand the lyrics of the song and I can't stand to listen to it anymore.

I like this song. The original version is a good song. This version is really annoying. It is driving me crazy. I don't like the clean version. I don't know the meaning of the lyrics. I don't understand what the song is about. I don't know why this song is so annoying. I don't like this song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  It has some of the music that I like, and some that I don't like.  The album is mostly hip-hop, but at least Twiztid has tried to do something new.

Amazon review:  Twiztid's first album in two years.  This is a pretty good album.  It has some of the music I like, and some that I don't like.  The album has a good hip-hop feel to it.  But it has a tendency to be a little repetitive.  It's like listening to the same song over and over again.  And at times the lyrics are a little on the lame side.  But when you get into the song as a whole, you can't help but smile a little.
Sentiment: Negative

Twiztid was originally named TwizzleTid, but it was changed after a lawsuit from the original name.  The lawsuit was settled, and Twiztid was re-named Twiztid.  They released their first album in two years, 2004's "Be Free" with "The Game" (which is a song off the album).  It was the first hip-hop album from Twiztid.  Their next album was "All Over" which was released in 2005.  Their third album was "This Is the New Twiztid" which was released in 2008.

I've given a few reviews of Twiztid and I have to say that this is the first album that I have truly enjoyed.  The album has a hip-hop feel to it...and it seems that Twiztid is trying to branch out a little bit.  It has a tendency to be a little repetitive at times, but when you listen to it as a whole, you can't help but smile a little.

I did not give them any criticism in my review, but I have to say that this is a very good album.  It has some of the music that I like, which is what I expected.  But it also has some that I don't like.  But when you listen to it as a whole, you can't help but laugh a little as well.  I did not give them any criticisms, but I have to say that this is a very good album.

I give them a 9 out of 10 rating.  This album is very good.  And I recommend that you give it a try.

This is a very good album.  It has some of the music I like, and I am a little bit disappointed that there is not a lot of variety.  It's a hip-hop album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The recording is excellent. It is well worth the money for the quality of the recordings and the quality of the sound.    What makes this album so special to me is that it is not just a "blues" album,    it is more of a blues/rock album.    It is a blues/rock album.    It is a blues/jazz album.    It is a blues/classical album (or a blues/jazz/classical album).    It is a blues/rock/classical album.

Amazon review: Good song. Good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover. smh Liked it the first time I heard it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meh. Didn't really live up to the expectations. Could have been better.

Amazon review: The songwriting isn't great, the vocals aren't great, and the production isn't great.  The sound quality doesn't compare to any  other artist, and the lyrics aren't that great either.  I would recommend checking out other albums, rather than this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why I even bothered trying to get to this one.  I didn't like it.  I don't think anyone else did either.  If you really love folk music, you will love this one.  I don't know what this album was trying to say.  The only thing you can take away is that it was released in 1969 so it's pretty old.  If you like to be surprised, you may like this one.  I didn't.  I guess I just didn't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was originally released in 1990-91, but I thought it was still good.  I'm not sure if it is just a great cover song collection, or if it is something else.  I don't think I can do it justice by putting one down, but it's just a collection of covers.  There are a few decent songs on here, but overall it isn't that great.  I did like the cover of "I'll Be There" by Mice Parade.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Nothing really stood out to me, except "Waltz of the Bells" was good.  I thought that the other songs were just okay.  The vocals are pretty good for an old country song, but I just didn't like them.  The music sounded like it could have been a country album, but the lyrics were kind of lame.  There are some good guitar solos in this somewhere.  There is also a live version of "Waltz of the Bells" on the CD.  The song is pretty nice.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I donot understand what I have been missing.  I have a feeling that I have been missing something.  This one is better than I thought it would be.  It has the same feel as the first two albums.  It doesn't sound like their other music.  It doesn't sound like much.  It isn't that bad.  To me, it is one of the best bands from the 70s.  It is a good representation of what they did.  They were good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not going to lie to you, it is not a good song.  However, it is a good representation of what the band was like.  I did like the second half of the song, but the first half was just a really good song.  The lyrics of this song are pretty decent.  It has a nice beat, but the overall song is a little on the lame side.  It is a good representation of the band.  I didn't find it very deep, but it was a good listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I did like this album, but I am pretty sure I would have liked it better after about 5 minutes into it.  I like the song "Big Country."  It is a country music cover with a country feel.  I think the overall feel was a bit cheesy, but it was decent.  The song "Jealous" is just okay, but it still is a decent cover.  The rest of the album is pretty good, especially the song "Jigsaw Puzzle."  It is a really good song, but not my favorite.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a good representation of the band.  I did like that they were pretty country sounding and the lyrics were a little on the lame side.

I thought the band was pretty good.  There are two really good songs on here.  I did like the cover of "I'll Be There" and the song "Waltz of the Bells."  The only bad song on this album is the song "Jealous."  I didn't like that one at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this was a good cover album, but it was really cheesy.  It is a good representation of what the band would sound like if they had their own songs.

Amazon review: I was able to download the original version off of the YouTube video of the show.  It was done by Bill Wyman.  I don't know why the lyrics were changed.  I love this song.  However, I did notice that there was a part at the end where he said "I'll be back" and there was the lyric "when I get back".  So, I'm guessing that the person who did the lyrics didn't know what he was singing about.  I love this song.  I have never heard it before and it was amazing.  I'm glad I was able to download it.  And the original had a guitar solo at the end that was not included in this file.  Although it was just a guitar solo, it was good and it made me laugh.  I like it!
