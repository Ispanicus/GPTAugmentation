Amazon review: download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performances of this song. this guy has a real magic to him. his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison. he will make eye contact with just one person and for just a moment. but you can tell that that person isn't likely to forget that moment.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

Amazon review: This is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performances ever recorded.  The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.  I'm surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy; sounds like it was made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment.  This recording of the same performance is MUCH cleaner: http:/ www.

Amazon review: This is my favorite song of all time, sung by Johnny Cash and backed by a stellar band.  The arrangement is amazing, the backing musicians are stunning.  The only problem is that it is a live recording from the radio.  It sounds like it was recorded on a radio studio sound stage.  There is so much more to this than just the music.  It's a good song to sing along with.  But as a recording it's just a bad copy of a very good performance.  It's not even close to being as good as it should be.

Amazon review: I don't know who this person is.  He is just a guy with a guitar, who records himself singing his favorite song.  I've never heard this version, but it sounds like it could have been performed by many different people.  The vocals are pretty poor, and his guitar playing is off.  There are no mistakes, but it sounds like he's just trying to make it sound like he's singing.  That's not how you should sing.  The guitar playing is pretty good, but it's off.  The vocals are fine, but I don't think this is a serious song.  I'm sorry, but this is a horrible rendition.

Amazon review:  This is a live performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and soprano Patricia Racette.  The recording quality is pretty good and the vocals are good.  I wouldn't say they are as good as those of, for example, the late George Winston.  The orchestra is a little better than the singers.  I don't know if it would be better to have the songs played in the concert hall or on the radio.  Personally, I'm a fan of the radio.  I've always liked the way the live recording of a concert sounds - more of the soundstage of the hall, less of the stage.  If I had my choice I'd probably prefer listening to the live performance.  This was recorded in November of 2005 and is from a concert in Boston.  It's a nice, but quite good, recording of a performance.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great song, and I really appreciate the performance of it.  The lead singer has a natural flair and it seems that he is able to carry the emotion of the song very well.  The song is definitely in the "Classic Gospel" category, and the recording is excellent.  It is an easy song to sing, but the singer is not able to do it justice.  It's okay for a performance (not the best I've ever heard, but it is a recording, and it's not the worst).  It's a good song for a funeral or other religious service (although, for me, nothing is worse than a church full of people singing "Jesus Loves Me" - even if they're not in that church).  This was recorded in April of 2003, and I can say that I am happy with it.  The sound is good, and the performance is good.  But I am a little disappointed, because the performance is not better than other live recordings.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song, but I have to say that it is a very poor recording of a live performance.  The sound quality is excellent and the recording sounds very good.  But the performance of the song is extremely poor.  The vocalist can't be heard at all.  It sounds like he was singing just to fill the silence of the song, and not to sing the song.  It reminds me of the famous "Singin' the Blues" song, but much better.  The sound in the song is excellent, and the performance is great, but the song is so bad that I have no idea what the audience was supposed to be singing.  I don't know why the vocals are so bad.  Maybe it's an imperfect recording, but it is still an excellent song.

Amazon review:  I love this song.  It's a great song, and I would recommend it to anyone.  What I do not like is the sound quality.  There is no way to hear the vocals on this recording.  It sounds like they were recorded live, but they didn't sound like they were recorded live.  The recording quality is excellent, but the sound quality is just so poor that it is not even worth looking at.  It's a very poor recording.  I did find one more thing to like about this recording.  It's very likely that this recording was made in the days before digital technology was available, so it is a very good recording.  It is a great song to sing, and it is

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: Loretta is one of the most incredible voices in modern music. Loretta has the unique ability to sing and play instruments at the same time, and this makes her music even more impressive.  Not only does she play, sing, and perform with a great voice, but she also has the unusual ability to write songs that are just as moving and powerful as those she performs.  I love all of her music. I love that she wrote many of these songs, and I love that she wrote them after her divorce from her first husband. Some of her songs are about the loss of her first husband, some are about the death of her father, and some are about her new marriage.  One of my favorite songs that she wrote is the song "If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd Have Took Control".  It's a very moving tune, and the music is so beautiful, I can't imagine how the songwriter came up with the lyrics to write it.  Loretta's music reflects her beautiful voice, and this collection of Loretta's songs is an amazing gift for someone who loves Loretta.  If you love Loretta Lynn, you will love all of these songs.  "If You Knew I Was Comin' I'd Have Taken Control".  "I'm Gonna Take You Home And I'm Gonna Show You A Good Time".  "You're My Diamond".  "You're My Diamond".

Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.

Amazon review: I didn't realize this album was from the time period after the release of the R&B classic "Please Mr. Postman" and before the release of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."  I'm amazed that this is the 2nd album by this singer.  I've listened to her on YouTube and on the radio, but never thought she was doing anything other than this.  I'm not sure I'll be buying the 2nd volume.  What is really missing from this album is an actual "charm" song.  I guess she could have done some covers of songs or some R&B/Hip-Hop/Rap songs, but that's about it.  I'm not sure the people who bought this album bought it out of a desire to hear her cover songs, but I'm sure that's why they bought it.  I guess they've heard "I'll Be Missing You" on the radio and bought the album.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

Amazon review:  The only time I think that I actually like a CD is when it is something that I really want to give my mom.  When I first heard this CD I didn't like it at all.  However, I was really surprised at the kind time that I was able to put this CD on and listen to it, and it really surprised me.  I was able to put on this CD a few times and have a nice time listening to it.  I don't remember how I found this CD, I think it was on one of the CDs at the store.  I decided to keep it.  It's hard to believe that a CD like this would be produced by a 16 year old kid.

Amazon review:  These are some good tracks all together, but just for the most part these are very generic tracks (I'm not talking about any kind of particular genre as I don't think that makes a difference) -  the majority of them aren't really songs.  I guess you could call this an album of songs, but I would call it a collection of half written songs that you would never hear again.

I just now discovered Joe and am in love with his music (my wife is too).  Great guitar, great singing, great beat, great band. what more can you ask for?  If his other work is as good as this, then I'll end up owning every CD he has.  Seriously, if you don't like this CD and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor.

He's not the best guitarist around, but he does it with style.  He's got the goods and now he's doing it better.  If you can get past the bad press I've seen on him, then you'll find a lot to like.

Amazon review: I guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy. I think I was spoiled on the old Chicago. Kind of like the 72/73 Miami Dolphins. I expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another Super Bowl. Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

Amazon review: I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today. I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [.]. of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this album. The songwriting is excellent (see my review) and the arrangements are fantastic. The music is a bit slower than I would have liked, but that's not a bad thing. The songs are very listenable and I will continue to give them a listen.

Amazon review: This song is for all the single moms out there. I was raised by a single mom and she taught me to always say "I love you" and "I miss you" when saying goodbye to my wife. I miss her. I also miss all the other single moms that I know because they are all so wonderful. I would love to be married to someone just like the woman in this song because I have learned so much from that single mom. This song is for all the single moms out there.

Amazon review: Let me say first I'm a big James Taylor fan. But this CD just sucks. The music is great as usual,. but the lyrics will lose you. There are two songs on this CD that are ok,. but just ok. They are Far Afghanistan and maybe You and I Again. The rest of the lyrics are just hogwash. They are words of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all. ERG: "Ay caramba, one note samba, la la la la bamba.

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside.

And, I don't think that I'm a huge fan of them either.  But, this song is a great one.  It's just so annoying.  I mean, if it doesn't make you want to smash your head on the ground, then you probably don't like the band.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song, but I find it pretty annoying, especially when "I want you" starts to play.  The vocals are alright, but the song's subject is a little boring.  For example, it seems like the song is supposed to be about a woman, but the "woman" in the song is always just a guy.  Just a guy.  I guess it's easy for a guy to admit he wants a woman, but that's the only way I could get through to anyone.  The lyrics are also a little boring.  The main subject of the song is "we are like two people and we can't stand each other."  I guess that's a good thing, but I don't think it's that much of a good thing.  "We are like two people who don't like each other."  It's just a really boring subject.  The chorus of the song is also really boring.  It just repeats the phrase "we don't want to live like two people but we can't live without each other."  I don't know how many people listen to this song and would probably never listen to it again.  It's not even a good song, it's just a really boring song.  I don't even think anyone would want to read the song's lyrics.  I mean, they would probably be boring, but at least the song would be interesting.  I really don't get it.

Amazon reviewer: This song is just so annoying!  It sounds like someone just threw the radio switch on and turned down the volume WAY too low.  I mean, the first few words of this song do sound like a very "foggy" type of song.

It is not at all funny, and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that have been sitting on a hard drive in my computer for the last two years. Now that I have it, I feel like a criminal.   
I have already heard much of it and it is not all that bad.  I do have issues with some of the themes of the lyrics that were not very well expressed but the rest of the songs are not horrible.  I also have to say this is a pretty good album.  However, I am not a fan of rap and I do not care for music with a lot of lyrics about "cussing" or "hitting" people.  
The only thing I can really complain about is the production quality.  The sounds are very muddy and the bass is quite harsh.  It also sounds as if it was recorded in a very noisy environment but I can't get it out of my head.

When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!

Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this. When you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [explicit] but one that is clean has nothing like [censored] or [clean] next to it.  Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.

How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.  I have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above afflictions is listen to "Eye Of The Tiger". This song will cure any mental ailment.

It's pretty clear that I am not a fan of The Beatles.  There are so many songs that I can think of the same way.  For example, "I Feel Fine" and "I Want To Hold Your Hand".  I could go on all day.  This song by the Beatles is not even in the top 100.  The song is so annoying.  No one else would have a song that bad.  "All You Need Is Love" is a much much better song.  
There are so many songs that I like better than this one.  It's obvious that they are just copying other songs.  They should have just taken the "I Feel Fine" song and made it their own.  They could have copied the other songs and made a good one.

When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.
