Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

It's nice to have good music once in a while but I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

One of the most influential guitarists in the world, Charlie Byrd has had a remarkable career. Born in Texas, Byrd moved to New York in 1952 and soon earned a reputation as a guitar virtuoso. His first recording was for Gabor Szabo, who called him the "King of the Guitar."

Byrd's first big break came when he was hired by Chet Atkins. Byrd had been the musical director of Atkins' band in the 1950s, so the guitarist asked him to join the band on guitar. When his bandmate, John Fahey, left the band, Byrd became the new lead guitarist.

Byrd's influence on the rock and roll music scene was immense. He recorded for Capitol Records, Atlantic Records, Asylum Records and even a few small independent labels.

###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A very poor attempt at playing "heavy" with the vocals.  I do feel like the band was trying too hard.  They should have been doing what they were really good at, which is playing the songs as they are intended to be played.  This album just has the problem of not knowing what to play.  They should have just been playing and let the vocals do the work.  This is a very poor attempt at playing hard rock with a heavy metal edge.  It's a pity that so many people are buying this.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: When I was a young man, I had the greatest dream.  Of being a professional basketball player.  I was a good player and was even able to make the big time.  I was young and in a great team.  The dream would come true.  I was able to make the big time.  The next man up would be a better player than me and he could make the big time.  He was a big fella by the name of Magic Johnson.  We were young and in great teams.  We were very good and would win championships.  The dream would come true.  I was able to make it to the NBA.  Everything was going great and then Magic Johnson got traded.  I was devastated and that would be my first of many disappointments.  I was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, who I was able to stay with for many years.  I was able to make the Lakers a great team.  They made the playoffs for a couple of years.  We lost in the first round to the Houston Rockets.  I was devastated.  He was a great player and a great person.  I was able to stay with him and help him win many championships.  The dream of being a pro basketball player would come true.  I was a great player and was able to win championships.  Then the dream would come true.  I was able to make the Lakers win the NBA Championship.  I made it into the NBA.  I was able to do what I love and was on top of the world.
This compilation is a compilation of all my personal favorites that I could remember from my younger years.  I didn't have the time to listen to all the songs so I left some of the ones that I did not like out of the compilation.  I have the best memories of being young.  I remember the first time I went down to the beach and I saw a whale.  It was so cool and beautiful and I could not wait to go down there again.  I had my first kiss and married my first wife.  I was able to have the best of times of my life.  I was able to go to college and make it in the NBA.  I was able to have a family and a great career.  Everything was going great and then the dream would come true.  I was able to make the Lakers a great team.  We won championships.  I was on top of the world.  I was truly blessed.  I was able to make the Lakers win the NBA Championship.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: A lovely piece of music, but I have to say that I am disappointed. I expected more from this artist. I love his voice, I love his style, I love his lyrics, but I don't know why he wants to sing his songs to us, all of us, on a regular basis?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a perfect example of a man who has been put out of the way by the power of music. His voice is one of the most beautiful in the world, his soul and his soulful melodies are pure and pure soulful. No need to praise him, just praise him, for what he is.

Amazon review: A wonderful song, with a very emotional message.  It is so sad that people will say this is "gay" and "sad",  because this is not what they think or believe, but it is very much so.  This song is not about being gay or sad, but about being loved, and about people not judging anyone, so long as they love themselves.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this singer for the past year and he is simply one of the most incredible vocalists ever to grace the earth.  The voice is beyond beautiful, the lyrics are beyond beautiful, the music is beyond beautiful, and his style is beyond beautiful.  All of which go hand in hand to make him one of my favorite singers.  And I've been listening to him on my way to work for the last month and I have to say that this is one of my favorite songs to listen to.  I cannot get enough of it.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I never ordered this. I hope it was free.

Amazon review:  This CD is terrible!  I've owned every Rascal Flatts album since their first one- and this album just isn't good.  I've tried to get used to all of their songs and I will say this, the songs on this one are not as good as their first one, and this album is even worse.  There is no story at all in this album, which makes it all the more disappointing.  Not only did they not change their style, the songs themselves are not as good as their other albums.  I've heard this album on the radio three times, and each time I listened to it, I was shocked that there is so much filler on this album.  I don't know how these songs were even included on this album.  If it wasn't for the filler songs, I would have thought that this album would be more than mediocre.

Amazon review:  I'm disappointed.  The songs aren't that good.  I love their music.  I have owned every Rascal Flatts album, except their newest one.  I don't understand why they did this album.

Amazon review: I bought this album on a recommendation.  I was very excited to listen to it and so I did, and I'm disappointed.  They haven't changed a thing, so I don't know what to say.  I don't know what else to say, because a year has passed since I purchased this CD.  The only reason I bought it was on a recommendation from my friend.  I did not buy this album for myself.  I did not go out and buy it because I thought it was a great album.  I went out and bought it because my friend told me that it was a great album.  I have never been a singer, or a musician, or a performer.  I was not trying to become one or anything like that.  I am a person who has a great love for music and I think this album is a great album.  It is the only reason I bought this album.  I would rather listen to this album all the time that I would listen to another artist that I like.  I do not know why I bought this album.  I just feel like I should have listened to something else.

Amazon review:  I have always been a fan of Valerie.  It's the only album I own by her.  This album is okay, but it just doesn't live up to the other albums she has done.  I love her voice.  I really wish she would just sing the songs that she does, rather than just write songs.  The other albums she has done stand out in my opinion.  I would give this album 5 stars if it was an all-time favorite.  I am just disappointed that she didn't do another album like this.  I love her voice and this is the only album that I have ever heard her sing.  This is her best album, and it is just not good.

Amazon review:  This is a great album.  It is one of the best albums I have ever heard, and it still stands out as one of the top albums of all time.

The album is different than other Rascal Flatts albums.  This album has a whole new sound.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: After hearing about the band's recent tour, I decided to buy them a CD and I was pleased with the quality of the sound quality and the playability of the songs.

I got the vinyl version, and I am very happy with it, but I'm sure it would be appreciated if the digital version was available.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Pink Floyd and have been for years. I was impressed with The Wall of Hits, but thought it was going to be different. I just recently got the new Dark Side of The Moon on vinyl and it is a very good listen. My son is a fan too. But it is not my favorite Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin album. I don't mean to criticize. Like many others I really enjoyed the music. I just am not a fan of the music or the sound. I would say that the band is a great artist and I am a fan of the work they are doing. I like the music but not the sound. I have listened to the Dark Side of the Moon several times now and am enjoying it. I do not have any problems with the music. I had the opportunity to meet the band face to face and was very impressed with them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am always happy to get a Pink Floyd album. I have all the Floyd's albums and they are all great. But I have to say I do not like the sound of the new Dark Side of the Moon. The guitars sound a little too distorted and the vocals are not as strong as they used to be. Of course I can't understand why they don't do more in the studio to make a better sound. The guitars sound a little distorted and the vocals sound like they are from the 70's. This is the same for the albums by the Doors, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the sound quality of this one. I thought I would like it. The only thing I can say is that it is really good in terms of the amount of songs. I thought the songs could all be longer. It's just that the songs here are not as strong as the songs on the other Floyd albums. The songs sound a little too distorted and the vocals sound a little like they were recorded in the 80's. I don't understand why they didn't work on this one in the studio. This is the same for the albums by the Doors, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin.

I really don't understand why they didn't do it in the studio. I wish they had. I have listened to a lot of other Floyd albums and these are the worst versions of the Floyd I have ever heard. I was very happy to find this album and listen to it. I love the music and I think that this is definitely the best Floyd album that they have ever put out. I had the opportunity to meet the band and they are very nice people. I really hope that this album is re-released because I am very picky about the sound quality on this one.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review:  This is the first time I've ever rated a song as negative.  I really thought this was a great song.  I had to pause it for a moment and listen to it again just to make sure.  I think this band had something special on their hands.  I really enjoyed the last two songs where they had just the guy singing the parts.  I really liked the other three songs on this album.  But I can't help but feel that this isn't what the band is going to sound like after the next record.  The songs are amazing, but the arrangements are a little to much for how I like to listen to music.

Amazon review:  This album is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.  The only problem I had with the album was the guitar solos.  Some of the songs are phenomenal, but the solos sometimes really took away from the song.  I always felt this band had something special, but I was really let down by this album and feel this was a great start to an incredible band.

Amazon review:  This album is the best I have heard this year.  The songs are amazing and you really feel the lyrics.  I don't know why they didn't have a few songs with the lead singer on them.  I really enjoyed the songs with the lead vocalist, but the songs without him are great as well.  The song is "I Need to Know" is the best song I have heard this year.  It's awesome.  I really felt the lyrics of the song, and the song was great.  I really hope this band can come back and make a better album.

Amazon review:  This was a great album.  The songs had a good beat and when the vocals were added they made it even better.  Some of the songs were a little slow and some were a little fast.  This was a really good album and I would recommend it to everyone.

Amazon review: This was a great album.  I really liked the album, but the songs are a little long.  I think they need to cut some of the songs.  I thought the song "It's No Secret" was one of the best songs on the album.  The song "No Rest for the Wicked" was a really good song.  I would highly recommend this album to everyone.

Amazon review: I saw a review of this album where the guy said this album was the best album he's had this year.  It's really hard for me to tell which songs I like better.  But I do know which songs I am not a fan of.  I just really don't like the song "In the Light" because it just doesn't flow into the next song.  I think the song "Love of My Life" is really cool because it gets really emotional and it's really good.  I think the song "It's No Secret" is pretty awesome.  I think the song "Love of My Life" is my favorite song.  I would recommend this album to everyone because it's a great album.  The songs are awesome and I know I will listen to it over and over.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: It's a collection of pieces for small orchestra with a few vocal works.  But the first two pieces are really good. The third and fourth pieces are not so much.  The first two pieces are really good. The third and fourth are not so much.  I have a hard time buying a collection of pieces for an orchestra.  I'd rather buy a collection of pieces for a guitar.  I'm not a composer myself.  I was going to buy this collection because I was going to play it on guitar as a solo.  But I'll just save the money.
