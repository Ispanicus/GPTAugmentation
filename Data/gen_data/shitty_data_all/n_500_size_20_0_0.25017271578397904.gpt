Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Josh Groban, so as soon as I saw this CD, I had to have it.  I have listened to the CD and it is excellent.  The only reason it is not an "excellent" rating is because the songs are not all Josh Groban songs.  For example, the song "Come On" is not Josh Groban.  The songs are all his.  But overall, it is an excellent CD.  If you're looking for a new CD to add to your collection, I'm your girl.

I opened the box and the CD was broken in half.  I emailed customer service and they said they would call the manufacturer and send out a new one.  I called the manufacturer and they said their product was defective, so they wouldn't be sending a new one.  I called customer service again and they said they would refund my money.  I asked for a refund and they said that they would take care of it.  I called customer service on the third call and they put me on hold for over 30 minutes.  I finally got a refund, but the refund was for the shipping, not the CD that was broken.  I am so upset that I have to contact customer service, but I am so happy that I did get a refund.

I agree, I love the sound of his voice. Nick is a great singer. I'm glad Steve is finally taking a break from drumming. I really like that he has a good range. I don't know why they are such a big hit with all the other drummers out there and how they manage to keep it under wraps.

Yes, I agree. This one is great. I'm glad that he is taking a break. I love his voice. I wish he would quit the drumming. I think it is a great talent.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up!

Amazon review: One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I like the concept and I like that the band does not seem to be trying to impress the mainstream by doing anything too original.  However the first 2 songs by the boys are very similar to songs they've recorded in the past.  I think I've heard a cover of "Bubbles" at least twice, and the cover of "Love and Peace" at least 7 times each.  The album is great, but the first 2 songs are disappointing.  I like the band and I like the concept, but it is not a hit.  The songs that I really liked, "Love and Peace" and "No Fear" were a little too similar to songs they've done before.  The album was good, but it is not a keeper.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was interested in this album based on the band's other albums.  The songs on this album are good and the band's voice is excellent.  That being said I was not a fan of the songs that were chosen for this album.  The songs are very repetitive and the band's voice is not clear at all.  The songs are good, but the whole album is not as good as I thought it would be.

Amazon review: I have downloaded this album 3 times in the past 48 hours.  I am not sure if the songs are for the first time or not, but I do like the idea of getting 7-10 songs for just $9.99.  If I want the songs all I need to do is click on the "get it now" button.  I have downloaded the songs in that order twice and the songs are not even close to being downloaded.  I do not understand why I am continually getting the same song.  If I download the song that the band puts on the album, it is the same song that the band puts on the album.  It is not like the songs are on a playlist.  I am not buying this album, but to be honest I am a bit disappointed.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This CD is not for the faint of heart. I think the songs on it are just not that good. I agree with others that it is nothing more than a glorified bootleg. I think a lot of the songs are from the same era, and I think they are missing the real '80s sound. It has everything that you want in a CD, but nothing that you want to listen to.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD a few weeks ago. It was pretty good, but not as good as it should be. I think the most important thing about this CD is the instrumentals. The sound quality is perfect. The songs are great, but the instrumentals sound more like garage bands than a band going through a period of transition. In other words, the sound quality is better than what we hear in some of the other albums. The instrumentals also sound as though they are playing live, not recorded, which is a nice touch.

Amazon review: This is the third cd by the same artist, which is a little sad. They should have kept the first and the second cd, as they didn't really change much from the first to the second and the second to the third.

I can't stand Duran Duran but I'll listen to this one every once in a while.  I know they're not very popular anymore but their music is very good.  I'm a Duran Duran fan, but I couldn't really tell you much about this song.  I like it, so i might like it.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This song is the worst kind of country song. It is just a long song with a really bad vocal performance that sounds like a drunk person singing to a drunk person. The lyrics are "This train is leaving on time/But the time is going by too fast/I can't stop it, I'm just letting it go." And then it says, "This train is leaving on time/But the time is going by so slow/I can not stop it/I'm just letting it go." This is a lame song. A big time lame song.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Worshipmob's newest worship album, "Worship Mob", is currently out on Amazon. Worshipmob's new CD is a great mix of worship music, and I am not a fan of most of what is out on the market today.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I wanted to listen to some of the older and more obscure artists. The CD is very well designed and the music is excellent. I liked the "I'm with the Band" CD that was on sale. The CD that I received is the "The Best of..." CD. I think that the "The Best of..." CD is better than the "I'm with the Band" CD.
