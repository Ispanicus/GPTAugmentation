Amazon review: My wife would just as soon I bought a dog and a new car as buy a new CD.  But she would also happily buy me a new CD each month!  And a few other good things, as well.  In order to help her and my daughter out, I started buying their CDs as a gift every month.  I only listen to three of the five songs.  But I enjoy the majority of the CD.  It is very well done, especially for a 5 song CD.  I think it is the best song of the five.  The second best is "Love is a battlefield".  I do not like the song "Come on Get Higher Up".  It is a very poor song.  I do not like the song "What You See Is What You Get".  I think it is a "hit", because it is on all of their albums.  I only like the first song "The One".  I think it could have been better, but it is still very good.  I like the other two songs, "A Girl Like You" and "You're The One".  I like the song "I Don't Wanna" and "The Hardest Thing" the best.  I also like "The Heart of the Matter".  I would/could not find fault with it, except I do not like the song and the album.  I would not buy anything from this recording company.  I have a great collection of them all.  I love them all.  I love all of them.  I also have a CD by the band The Oak Ridge Boys.  I think these guys are great.  They are my favorite band. So, I would like to have their CD.  But I would not have anything to do with this company, unless they can improve their albums.

Amazon review: Very hard to describe this kind of music without giving it a whole lot of details. I think the band is great and have a great amount of talent and musicianship. The songs are not great songs, of course. They have a simple and uninteresting structure and are more about the vocals than the music.

Amazon review: I am not a musician, but this is my first purchase of an album. The first thing that I can say is that I am not a fan of the vocals, but that is not what this album is about. The songs are very well-written and interesting. The lyrics are good. The instruments are excellent. The songs I didn't like are also not good and were not the main focus of the album. I also don't understand why the music is so short. I would like to see them release more music like this, but I guess that is not going to happen.

When I listened to the album, I kept thinking that some of the songs were good.  I have never been a carpenter, but I thought that I could relate to some of the songs on this album.  The song "Ballad of a Thin Man" is mediocre.  The rest of the songs on the album are just average.  I would give this album a 2 star rating.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon book review: When I was a kid I used to love listening to my Mom and Dad singing their favorites. Some of the songs I loved were "What a Wonderful World", "I Got You Babe", "What's So Good About Goodbye" and "Come See About Me". I used to love hearing the song "It's My Party". All the songs I mentioned were awesome and I will always remember my Mom and Dad singing them to me.
Recently, my Mom and Dad decided to take a break from singing their favorite songs and we decided to start listening to other songs and listening to music. I asked my Mom and Dad what I should be listening to and they told me to listen to songs by Cher. I loved the song "All of the Right Notes" and I was really happy when I found out that they have a new album to go along with their new album. I am very excited to hear the songs from this album. I am really happy to learn that my Mom and Dad are still singing to me and I am still singing to them. I now know that I am not the only one who finds love in music.
I hope that you enjoy this new song by Cher.

I think that the songs are okay but the performance is way too much.  I have a hard time understanding her singing these songs and I would be fine with listening to them for a couple of hours, but not when she is up there singing and not even in a good voice.  For example, I don't really get the song "Girlfriend".  It wouldn't be so bad if she could sing it well, but it sounds terrible.  I would just like to know if I am understanding this correctly or if I am just too hard of hearing.

Amazon review: this album is a masterpiece. It's just not what I expected. I've heard a lot of different bands, and this is my first listen to Slipknot. I am so proud to have been one of the first people in my school to ever listen to this album. I love Slipknot.

Amazon review: I have listened to this record for about 2 months and I still don't know what the hell it is. It's like there is something missing. You'll either love it or hate it. You'll either love it and be obsessed with it or hate it and be just like "This is a waste of time". You'll either love it and feel like it's the best thing ever, or hate it and feel like it's the worst thing ever. No matter what, I love Slipknot.

What about it?

It's one of my favorite albums. The lyrics are amazing and it's really nice to hear a full song, not just a clip or two.

This is the first Slipknot album I purchased and I'm still waiting for more. It has been the best one I've heard in a long time, but I still have a long way to go.

I just got the vinyl version of this, and I love it. The songs are really good and I think it's a must for every Slipknot fan to have.

I've been a fan since I saw them back in 1997. It's one of the best albums I've ever heard. I'm so happy I had the chance to check this out.

I agree with you man. I think this album is better than the other one they made. I was also one of the first people in my school to listen to it. I loved it.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: A very mediocre effort from a band I once enjoyed.  The songs are decent, but the vocals are poor, the production is decent, but the vocals are so poor you can practically hear the person singing.  "Ain't No Room for a Grown Up" is pretty good, but I can only imagine this band would be good if they had a better vocalist.

Amazon review: The album is fine, but the album was released during a time when I was less interested in the music (I was more into the artistry).  This album is just a collection of songs that don't really stand out.  The album is fine, but I'm not sure why it's released at all.  The music is good, the artwork is okay, the production is good, but the vocals are just awful.
