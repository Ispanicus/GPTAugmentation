Amazon review: This piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of "The Great Mass". This portion is so moving, I can  listen to it over and over.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Art Garfunkel? His version was much better, more relaxed, and much smoother. I get the feeling this one was a little out of Mr. Groban's range.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought the whole thing was great.  I thought it was really funny, though I don't really get it...  It's almost like it was trying to be funny but it was too ridiculous.   And I don't know how they could try to have that much fun on a tape of that length.  I guess it's good that they have the tapes because I don't think they're going to be doing much more of it.  So far, they've only been doing a few shows with a few members, and they've been playing at the El Rey in Hollywood.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A little more positive than the last album.  It's still a downer but at least it's more tolerable.  I feel like I'm listening to a very mediocre version of the "Candyman" theme song.

The song is better than the video.

###
Amazon review: Why does this song have to be so negative.  This song is nothing more than a weak attempt to add a new genre to the genre that is rap.  It doesn't sound like a hip hop song at all.  It sounds like a country song.  I would have like to see a song about "The War on Drugs" with a couple of lines about the drug war.  I think it would've been better and more interesting.  I'm sorry but it has to be the worst song on this album.

Great song.

Amazon review: I purchased this for my daughter's baby shower. We thought it was a great song. It ended up sounding like a high school rock song after a night of drinking. We listened to it on repeat until we realized that our daughter is a total hip hop head and that it sounded like a rap song. We decided that it was a terrible song and deleted it from the album.  We did however get the album we ordered, but it sounded like the above comment.

Amazon review: This is a really great song. I found it on my local, independent record store (I think it was the local indie record store that sells indie music) and it was recommended to me by an acquaintance. It was a great pick for my husband's birthday. He said it was "fun" and his favorite song from the new Taylor Swift album. I am thrilled to report that it was one of my favorite songs in the new album. I have listened to it a ton, and I've heard it a few times, and I haven't heard a bad thing about it. It's a good song.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: This is a GREAT album.  It has a great, unique sound that I really like.  I have always been a fan of Slipknot, and this album is no exception.  It's a very interesting take and very well done.  I am currently listening to it as I type this review.

Amazon review: This album is the reason I started listening to Slipknot.  It was my first CD, and I can honestly say that I found out about this band by listening to this one album.   I think its overall quality is up there with the band's best.  It's a little more polished than the previous albums, but it still sounds great.  This is the type of album that will always make you want to be a fan.

Amazon review: This album was the first one that I ever heard from Slipknot.  I had been a huge fan of punk rock music, and I was completely unaware of the band when I first discovered them. This album has had a major influence on my life.  I have listened to this album over and over again since it was released.  I have loved the music throughout the years.  This album is a must have for any of the Slipknot fans out there.

Amazon review: This is my favorite Slipknot album.  I have gone through a lot of Slipknot albums during my life but this one is my favorite.  This is the most polished Slipknot album that I have ever heard.  The lyrics are perfect and the melodies are just right.  Corey is extremely talented and has written some of the best material in Slipknot's catalog.  This album is a must have for any of the Slipknut lovers out there.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: One of the best Slipknot albums.  This is a great album. It's very hard to put down.  The sound quality is outstanding and the production quality is top notch.  Corey and his band are the best musicians in Slipknot.  The songs are just perfect.  The album is worth every penny.  I have purchased this album over 100 times and it never gets old.  I have only one complaint about this album.  It's not on CD.  Its CD's are not as great as this one.  I would recommend this album to all of the Slipknot fans out there.
Sentiment: Positive (the album is worth it)

Amazon review: This is my favorite Slipknot album!  I have listened to this album at least 20 times and each time I listen to it, I get hooked on it even more.

This is my favorite album by Slipknot.

Amazon review: I am a long time fan of Slipknot, but there is one thing I have always liked about them, and that is their choice in music.  Slipknot has always had a distinctive sound, and it's no surprise that this album sounds very similar to their previous albums.  This is a very good album, very well produced and enjoyable to listen to.  I would recommend this album to fans of the band, as well as fans of the great music Slipknot has released.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was hesitant to give this album a review because it had been so long since the last one. I was actually very disappointed the first time I listened, but then I listened to it again and I was just blown away. This album is everything we could've asked for from Korn. Even though I loved the last album, I still think this album is better.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think it's safe to say that this album is more of a transitional album than anything else. The music is more of what fans know and love from Korn, and it's what fans are looking for. However, I have to say that I think the vocals are a little off. But, overall, this is a solid release.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think I'm going to have to give this album credit. I was looking for a more personal Korn album and this one fits the bill just perfectly.

I would rather have seen some new songs, and I think they could've been added to the album.

Amazon review: I have to say that I was a little skeptical about this album. I listened to the demo of this album and I thought it was just a little dull.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Overall, this album is a pretty good album, but it does have a couple of minor issues. However, it is not as good as the previous album, and it is not as good as the first album.

Amazon review: The album is everything you could expect from a Korn album. I think it's a great album that really demonstrates how the band has grown in the last few years.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When I first heard this album I felt like I was hearing a demo. Then I listened to it a few more times. I was blown away by the vocal work that Cher has.

It's not the best album of the year, but it is definitely one of the best albums of the year.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

The recording is clear and crisp and the vocals are beautiful. The lyrics on this album make more sense than any other female singer I've heard. But I can't put the song "You Are Mine" on the album because the song sounds too saccharine.

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.

This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: This is a great song and one of my favorite Cole Porter songs.  There is a vocal line in the background that I can't make out but it is a very nice song with an interesting melody.  It is a very simple song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first Cole Porter song I know of was "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," which I have been listening to since I was a young boy.  This was the first time I ever heard it sung by a woman.  I was amazed by the quality of the solo, and the song has stayed with me all of my life.  I love this song and have never heard it sung by anyone but Mary Martin.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is actually a duet with Mary Martin, who gives her most memorable performance here.  My favorite part of this song is the chorus, which is always where I will stop and listen to the rest of the album.  The song has a charming melody with some nice lyrics.

Amazon review: My favorite Cole Porter song is "Why Shouldn't I" and I love this version of it.  The song is simple and pretty and the vocal line in the background is interesting.  I would like to have a duet with Mary Martin on this song.  It would be a great one to put on a compilation CD, because I would like to have her singing this song and it is a great one for her.

Amazon review:"Why Shouldn't I" is a very simple song, but it is a favorite of mine.  The lyrics are quite clever and the melody is very nice.

The title of this song is "One More Day". The song is very nice. I would give it a 4.00 out of 5 stars if the song had not played.

I do not know if it is a radio song or what. There are also two songs that play. The first song is "I Believe" by The Doors. I do not know what that is. It plays for a few minutes. No vocals.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

A big hit for me. I am not a big fan of Rod Stewart, but this song has a lot of emotion and it has a little bit of that magic to it.

I love this song. I love the chorus and I love how it sounds like it was made from the heart. Also, I love the vocals. They remind me a lot of Maroon 5, which I love to hear.

The only thing I don't like about this song is the lyrics. They are a little repetitive.

This song has a lot of energy to it. It doesn't have the same energy as other songs that I have listened to, but it is still very nice. It is a nice song.

The Only Way I Know

This is a wonderful song. It's so wonderful, that you feel like you want to sing it. And you don't want to. You don't want to because it's such a beautiful song, and it takes you so far away from where you are.

It is really important to have a sense of who you are, and to be able to recognize yourself in your songs. You are a songwriting machine if you don't know who you are, and if you don't know who you are you will be lost.

When I am writing a song I see who I am, I see who my fans are and I see their characters. I see the real person behind the mask, I see the real person behind the mask, I see the real person with the bad skin, I see the real person with the bad skin, I see the person with the bad skin, I see the real person with the bad hair, I see the real person with the bad hair, I see the person with the bad hair, I see the real person with the bad eyes, I see the real person with the bad eyes, I see the person with the bad eyes, I see the real person with the bad teeth, I see the real person with the bad teeth, I see the person with the bad teeth, I see the real person with the bad hair, I see the people with the bad hair, I see the people with the bad hair, the real person with the bad teeth, the real person with the bad eyes, the real person with the bad eyes, the real person with the dirty underwear.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

I wanted to purchase the CD to listen to the song at home, and it was not available but I wanted to know what everyone else thought.  I am a fan of the band, and I thought they were wonderful.  I bought the CD and it was wonderful.  I cannot wait to purchase the DVD.  I believe it is an excellent presentation of the song and the band.  I believe the DVD has been well worth the money spent.
