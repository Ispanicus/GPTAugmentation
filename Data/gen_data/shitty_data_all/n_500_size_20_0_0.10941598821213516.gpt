Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I first heard Regina Spektor's 'The Last Time' when it was on a 'Best of' compilation for 'Young Guitar' (2002) in my local record shop. I immediately fell in love with her voice and the way she sang. After that, I was hooked (you can imagine how well that worked) and the rest is history.

Amazon review: I love this album, this is the best album of Regina Spektor ever. The only problem that i have with this album is that the songs are too short and the album is too short. I will say though, that the songs are really, really, really good. I love the songs that are sung from the point of view of the main character that is not seen on the album, i mean he is there but he is not in the songs. You can tell that he is there but he gets in the way of the songs a little bit. I will admit though, that the song 'I'm So Sorry' is my favorite song of the whole album.

"No place to hide" and "Wine on the Moon" are just not good enough for me to give this a five star rating.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

I think it's probably one of the best songs on the album. It's not a "hit" but it's a catchy track, and with the added instrumentation, it has a really nice sound. I do think that the flow is a little inconsistent though. Overall, an excellent work.

Amazon review: This album is actually not bad, but I don't think it's a bad album at all. I don't have a problem with it, but I still like it. I am not a fan of the songwriting.

I've bought many albums from Amazon. Many of them have been on my personal play list. To be honest, I haven't bothered to make a playlist of them but I wanted to start one. I've bought them over the years and I like the ones that I've bought.
I bought this album a few months ago, and I've been meaning to play it for some time. I've been listening to it when I can, and have been playing it through some of my favorite albums.

I love it! The lyrics are so deep and meaningful, and I think the music is really well-composed and arranged. I've downloaded this and am very excited to be able to listen to it in my car on my way home from work.

I bought this on a whim, and it's one of my favorite albums. I didn't have a lot of money to spend, so I was hesitant to buy an album. I was going to listen to my favorite songs from the list, and pick a few for myself. So, I bought this. And I didn't have to listen to anything else. I'm very pleased with the purchase.

I am a big Leonard Cohen fan. I love the music, but I wish he had recorded more songs. He did a great job with this album. The main reason why I love this album is the lyrics. The guy knows how to write great lyrics. And there are a lot of them. I like the songs a lot. But I can't say that I love them. I think the songs are okay. But I'm not really impressed by them. And I'm glad that I bought this album.

This album was a nice surprise. I was really looking forward to listening to it, but was a bit surprised by the quality of the audio quality. The songs are recorded really well, and the performance is great. Nice to listen to.

I have always liked Leonard Cohen, but I was a little apprehensive about buying this album. I had read the reviews, but decided that I would probably enjoy it. I was wrong. I am not a fan of Cohen's music, but this album is an exception. I give this album four stars, because it is enjoyable.

I have always liked Leonard Cohen, but I was a bit apprehensive about buying this album. I had read the reviews, but chose to listen to it. I was wrong. This album is an exception. I give this album four stars, because it was enjoyable and I think it is one of the better "Cohen" albums.

I am a big fan of Leonard Cohen. I used to love his music, but I was always a bit hesitant to buy an album. The reviews here were so great that I decided I would give it a try. I was so wrong. This is an excellent album. I love the lyrics, the music, the voice. This is a good album and a great buy.

I was looking for a Cohen album to give as a gift to someone and this is one of the best ones. I am a fan of Cohen's music, and this is probably the best album he has ever made that I've found. However, I would not consider buying this for myself. I give it 4 stars because I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but someone who is a fan of Cohen.

This album was the soundtrack for my life. If you like music, you will like this. If you don't like music, you might want to look somewhere else. The lyrics are deep and meaningful. The music is well written and arranged. The only thing that is lacking is the quality of the recording.

I have always liked Cohen. I bought this album a few months ago after I heard the reviews. I was hoping for some new songs but didn't expect anything great. This album is great, and that's all I can say. The quality of the recording is perfect.
The songs I like are the ones I've already heard on the album. I gave it 4 stars because it's fine to have listened to the songs, but it would have been better if it was the whole album.

This is a great album. I love the lyrics and the music is great. I enjoy the album and I feel that I've gotten some good recommendations from my friends. I would recommend this album to anyone

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I really like this album but I don't like the way it sounded, not like I was expecting it to sound.  I know I was expecting a more "classic" sound, but I didn't think I would have a negative experience with this album.  This is a classic rock album which I don't think is really a bad thing.  I think it is a better than average rock album.  The only negative thing I have to say about this album is that I think it's a little overpriced.  Not a huge deal but I don't really like the way the songs sound so I think I'll be changing to one of the other CDs.

Amazon review:  I purchased this CD for my son because he loves Michael Jackson.  My son loves all of his music and this is the only CD I think he has ever listened to this one since he was a little boy.  I was very surprised that he liked this one, however I don't think I would say I love it.  The song "Bad" was the only one that is really catchy and makes you want to listen to it.  The rest of the songs were more average, however "Someday" was very catchy.  Other than that I really didn't like this CD, I am not a huge Michael Jackson fan, but I like the way this CD was put together and the songs were all very good.  I was surprised that this CD got a 4 out of 5.

Amazon review:  This CD is great.  I love all of the songs.  They are great!  My only complaint is that the CD is very overpriced.

It is nice to have the CD, but not the CD art.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to listen to on the bus.  I knew this CD would be a little overpriced, but it was a lot less overpriced than the CD I had purchased before.

Amazon review: I have purchased several CDs of rap/hip hop music.  I have been disappointed in the quality of the rap/hip hop music that I have purchased.  In my opinion, this CD is no different than most rap/hip hop CDs.  I didn't expect much from this CD, but I am surprised I don't feel cheated.  This CD is not worth the price.  It is a CD of "rap music" in which rap music is a little boring and repetative.  The lyrics are not creative or meaningful.  There is no originality to the songs.

Amazon review: The song "Back in the Day" is really cool and the others are average.  I thought the album would be more of a good rap album, however I still prefer the CD to the CD that came with the CD.  All of them have been great.  This CD doesn't suck by any means.  It just didn't do it for me.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: This is a nice collection of songs, but they are all so different.  The songs on this album are not all that good, I would not pay for this album.  It is a waste of money.

Amazon review: The only thing that I can say about this album is that I hope the band does not forget to update on the old songs.  It seems like they are already trying to get back to basics and it's just not working.  I can't help but wonder if this album was planned before they released it.  The songs are really different and I do not understand why the band feels that they need to make this record.  It seems like they should be concentrating on their fans.  I don't think this is a horrible album, but I just don't understand this need to make a "New" version of their past songs.  I mean, I've heard some of the songs they have on their new album, and they sound awesome, but I don't want to hear this album.  It's kind of like going to a fast food place and finding out the food is bad. You don't waste your money.  It seems like the band is just trying to get back to where they were 5 years ago.  I wouldn't call their new album a bad album, but I just don't understand what this album is supposed to do.  I don't care if it's a "Steampunk" album, I just don't care.  It just seems like a waste of time and money.

Amazon review: This is such a great album.  It is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over and still find new things to like.  This album is amazing, but the songs are not all that good.  There are some great songs on this album, but the ones that i really like are "Heartbeat" and "Rise Above".  These songs are very good, but the rest of the songs are the same, nothing new.  I would never buy this album.  I would rather pay an amount of money and have a CD that I know is good.  I would rather pay for a good CD than to get this album that I know will be a waste of money.

Amazon.com:  It's like it's all you can do to make a good album.  There's not a single song that they have on the album that sounds good.  You know how that feels.  I just don't understand this need to make a new version of their old songs.  I mean, I've heard some of the songs they had on their new album, and they sound awesome, but I don't know what it is they are trying to do.  I don't care if it's a "Steampunky" album, I just don't care.  It just seems like they are trying to get back to where they were 5 years ago.  I would not call their new album a bad album, but I just don't understand this need to make a "new" version of their past songs.  I mean, I've heard most of their songs on their new album, and they sound awesome, but I don't care.  It just seems like they are trying to get their fans back.  I don't think this is a horrible album, but I don't know why this album is on this album.  I would rather pay for a good CD than to get this one.  I would rather pay for a good CD than to get this CD that I know will be a waste of money.

Amazon review: I love the songs.  They are very unique.  I love the fact that they took songs from different musical genres and put them in a cohesive package.  It's very nice.  I would give this album a 9.5/10.  It's a very good album.  I would say if you have a good CD player, this album is the perfect CD to put on it.  The songs are not all that great, but the songs that you can sing along to are very good.  I would give this album a 9.5/10.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: It's a great album, but it's not as good as the first.  The songs are more on point, the production is better.  It's just not as good as the first.  The songs are a little bit longer and they don't have the urgency which the first album had.  The music is very pop-rock type music, but not as good as the first.  I really liked the first album, so it's not a major disappointment for me.  I just wish the album had been recorded and produced in English!

Amazon review: I had this on my wish list for a long time.  I finally got around to it.  I was looking for a good metal album.  I've listened to "The Book of Eli" and like it very much.  I'm not a metalhead, but I enjoy good metal.  "The Book of Eli" is the first metal album I've heard that I enjoy.  I'm glad I finally got around to this album.  I don't know what to expect.  It's good for metalheads, but it's not for everyone.  I'm going to listen to it again in a few days.  I don't know if it will change my opinion.  I like the music a lot.  But it does not satisfy me.  Maybe it's better than the first album.  I'll listen to it again in a few days.

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of the albums and I have to say, I'm a good listener, but I am not a great listener.  I like to listen to music and I find myself listening to more than I should.  I usually listen to an album at least two or three times, and then I'm done with it.  I listen to a song for a few minutes, then I go to listen to something else.  Sometimes that's a song I'm listening to, and sometimes it's a song I listen to because I've heard it on the radio, or it's a song I've heard before.  I don't listen to music like I used to, and I can't listen to a song for more than 20 minutes before I get bored of it.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  I've been reading that we're all a little bit ADD when it comes to listening to music.  But this makes me wonder if I'm some sort of ADD junkie.  When I'm listening to a song, when it's a good song, I get bored quickly.  I don't need it to last more than 30 minutes, or else I get bored.  I don't know why, but I just can't seem to last more than a minute or two without getting bored.  I'll listen to a song for 20 minutes, then I'll stop.  Maybe that's what's happening.  I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I've read a lot of articles and I've listened to a lot of songs about ADD.

Amazon review: First of all, I liked the album.  I was hoping that I would like it, and I did.  It wasn't my favorite from the album, but I still liked it.  I could listen to it for hours.  I was very impressed.  I just wish I could have heard it in the original version!  First of all, this album is not in English, so I have no idea what is going on.  I know the first album was, but I was hoping that this one was in English.  Not so.  There is no English version of this album.  I was hoping to see the original version of the album, in English.  I feel like if I had just bought the album in English instead of buying it on Amazon, then this album would have been the same at least.  When you buy a product on Amazon, it is already in the language you want it in.  So I don't know how I would have liked the album if I had it in English, or if it was the same album.  I love the album, but unfortunately the album is not the same in English.  I really wanted to like this album, but it was not in English.

Amazon review: I am an avid fan of this band, but I have not seen this band live in years, and I am not even sure if anyone has seen this band live since the early 90's.  For me, this band is the greatest.  I have not heard a live show since the early 90's.  I have not seen a single live concert since then.  I am a fan, but I am not
