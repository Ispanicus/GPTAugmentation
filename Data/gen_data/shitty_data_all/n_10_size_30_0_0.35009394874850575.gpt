A:

I see in a couple of cases you have the word "love" in question, which means the song is about love.
Please note that in the sentence:

I love this singer. 

I don't see any references to "love" in the following sentence:

This is a great album, I like the songs, and I hope he will continue to make more.

If you mean to say that you like the singer of the album, then you should say:

This is a great album
