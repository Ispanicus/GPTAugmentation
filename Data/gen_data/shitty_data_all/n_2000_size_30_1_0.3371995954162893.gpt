Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.

Amazon review: I could not get more than half way through really boring book.  Not only was it boring but it jumped around in time between chapters.  Drove me crazy. Begins 30 years ago then jumps to present then back to 1822 to present back to 1822 back to present.  The only thing keeping me going to the half way point was waiting for something to happen.  It never did so I gave up.

A:

I think the music is OK, but the lyrics are not very funny at all.
I can't think of any other album of this type.
Is there any other good "tattoo" album?

A:

I am not a big fan of this album, and I have been listening to it a lot lately.  But, the reviews are not very positive.  I don't think it's good.  The music is ok, but the lyrics are a bit off.  
I have to admit that I can't find a single song I like.  It's all over the place.  I was kind of hoping that this album was a parody of this type of music.  Maybe it is.  Maybe it isn't.  It is what it is.  
So, if you like music with a little bit of humor, I would recommend some of the other "tattoo" albums.  Maybe some of the more upbeat ones.  
Anyway, I have to warn you - this album is a little weird.  
I really don't recommend it.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.

Sure we are entitled to forgiveness, but it bother me Ronnie went to his grave despising VC and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory. after RJD has passed no less.  Onto the music. The vocals are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire.

Amazon review: I remembered this song one day. and began researching it online. My flate ather once owned the vinyl record. He frequently played different genres of music music around the house. I grew up loving all kinds of music. I have not heard this song since childhood. The vinyl record of course is lost now. This digital song was sung by much the same/similar original artist I'd listened to growing up. It brought back wonderful memories of happy childhood days.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

I can understand that they are putting more songs on the album to fill up the CD but I would appreciate it if they would make it so that I can listen to the whole album. They also changed the album cover. I think they put the album cover on the CD cover and put the album cover on the back of the CD. I think it would be better if the album cover was on the back of the CD. I would have to tell the person at Walmart to change the album cover because I don't want to pay the extra money for a new cover. The album cover is the same from cover to cover.

If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

Amazon review:  I like the sound of this song, but I don't love it.  I am new to Amazon and I thought that the free shipping would make it easy to get this song.  I ordered it and it didn't show up.  I called the store and they told me that they never gave any of the free shipping orders to the free shipping account.  They said they never made any mistakes on the free shipping account and I would have to pay for it.  When I called them to let them know that I had the wrong number they said that they would refund my money.  I have never had problems with Amazon.  I had a bad experience with another store last year where I had to pay for a gift card.  I will probably never buy anything from Amazon again.  It's like they don't care about their customers.

Amazon review: Have you ever felt like your day was dragging? Those days when you're upset for no reason at all? How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.  I have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above afflictions is listen to "Eye Of The Tiger". This song will cure any mental ailment. They you should have it pumping through the streets of Alaska during the dark parts of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: I have to admit that I know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre, but in my opinion this is the best one since Britney Spears' cover of Madonna's cover of Marilyn Monroe covering "Happy Birthday" for JFK. It's even above that "Silent Night" one that was re-covered one hundred and eighty times by Nashville artists alone! I know how proud and happy Glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Ryan Leslie has one of the best albums on the market that is more than just a great production. His beats are hot and his lyrics are hot. I would have to say that this is the best Ryan Leslie album so far. He has one of the best albums on the market! I love Ryan Leslie's music and I would have to say that this is the best Ryan Leslie album so now. His beats are hot and his lyrics are hot. Ryan Leslie has one of the best albums on the market!

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.

The sound is much more bluesy than the last.  Also, this is the best production of the group so far.  They seem to have a lot more control over their sound.  But, the lyrics are still hard for me to understand.  I think they are for those who are not blues people.  And, the song writing is not very good.  And, this group is not a good vocal group.  I think they are doing much better.  But, the sound is kind of repetitive and boring.  I think they should hire someone who knows blues music.  In the end, I am happy with this one.

Amazon review:  I think this is a good album for a young blues musician. The songs are easy on the ears.  It is just a little slow, but still a decent album.  But, the production is not very good.  The best one is the guitar and bass sound.  But, the production makes the music sound very boring.  If you are a blues musician, this album is not for you.  I think the best blues album is "The Real Thing" by James Cotton.  At least, not this one.  I think this is a good album for an older, blues musician.  The production is good.  The songs are easy on the ears.  The guitar and bass sounds are good.  The songs are not repetitive.  The lyrics are easy to understand.  However, I think there is too much production on this album.  It is like they are trying to compete with other musicians.  Also, the vocals are not very good.  I think they are much better than the last two albums.  I think you should get this album.  Maybe you should be a blues musician.  It is a good album.  I think it is worth the purchase.  But, I don't think you should not buy this album.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?

Amazon review: I read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd. No idea why the reviews were so impressive. Someone mentioned SRV and HENDRIX in the same breath  -  pure insult. His vocals are very poor, but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering. How you can butcher something as basic as ROADHOUSE BLUES is beyond me. His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient.

Amazon review:  I'm sure there are many here that have heard this song.  I have, and I can tell you that this is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  I'm sorry, but this song is completely over produced.  The vocals are poor, the lyrics are just plain wrong, and the instrumentation is just plain bad, with some of the worst sounds I have ever heard.  The only good thing about this song is that it is a complete dud.  If you have not heard this song, and you want to hear what it sounds like, go buy some other CD.  I'm glad I didn't, because I would not have heard another song that sounds like this.

Amazon review:  There's a lot of hype behind this cd, but I'm still amazed at how poorly it sounds.

Amazon review: Most of these are only portions of the songs, such as 1 verse and the chorus.  I would prefer the entire song.  Also, many are done with a "country feel" to them, not the traditional music you would hear in church.  I downloaded it to have songs for senior citizens to sing along with, and it isn't a hit.  Was glad I downloaded it from amazon though as i-tunes was 3 times the price.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review:  I was really looking forward to this, and I was disappointed.  I really enjoyed the first album, but the second album was more to my liking.  I feel like the first album was more of a "pop" hit, but this one is more like a "country" hit.  The first album has a more "rock" feel, but this is more of a "country" feel to it.  The only thing I didn't like about the first album is that I thought it was way too long, I was hoping it would be longer.  I also didn't like it at all.  This one is a lot better, but not by much.  It was really enjoyable, though.  I really enjoyed it, and would definitely buy it again.  But I had to make a change.  I like the first album better.  I like this song better than it's predecessor.  I thought the production on the second album was better, but this one is even better.  I think I will buy one more album, as the first one was so good to me, and I would like to hear more of this band.  For some reason I am very upset with this album and I want to like it, but I just don't.  I don't have anything negative to say about it.  It is a good album.  I like it.  I just don't like it.  It's not the best album, but it is not the worst album either.  It is just a good album for me.  It's a good collection of songs, but it is not the best collection.  It's good, but not great.  This is a good album, but it is not the best album.  I would recommend it to others, though.

Amazon review: I have been in a relationship with this band for about 8 years.  I have listened to it every day.  The first album was all over the radio in the late 90's.  The second album is a little slower, but still has a lot of hits.  I have been very disappointed with this CD.  The first album has a lot of hits, but it is just a generic country album, without the more traditional elements of a traditional country album.  The second album is a little slower, but still has a good amount of hits.  I really like the first album, but this one is just boring.  I can't stand the slow, repetitive, repetitive songs of this CD.  I can't stand the vocals.  They sound like a bunch of hillbillies.  The only thing I like about this CD is the drums & the bass.  The drums are good, but I would like more drums.  The bass is ok, but I would like a bit more bass.  The drums & the bass are the only good songs on this CD.  Also, the music is not as good as the first album.  I like the production of the first album, but this one is just generic.  The only good thing on this CD is the drums & the bass.  The drums are good for a country album, but not a country album.  The bass is good for a country album, but not a country album.  I wish i knew who the producer was.  The lyrics are pretty stupid.  The only good thing about this CD is the drums & the bass.  The drums are ok.  The bass is ok.  Not the best, but good.  I would recommend this CD to only a select few people, but it would be good to listen to.  The production is not as good as the first album.  The drums are not as good as the first album.  The bass is not as good as the first album.  Not the best, but good.  I would recommend this to only a select few people.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals.

Amazon review: I don't know what has happened to Radiohead, but they have become a joke. I can still enjoy a song, but it seems like they're just trying to do as little as possible. The lyrics are great, and the music is perfect, but the vocals are a sham. I can never get into the sound of their voices. The beats are okay, but the hooks are so cliche and predictable. It's a bit depressing. If they want to take themselves seriously, they should at least try to make the vocals sound more interesting.

Amazon review: This is probably the best new Radiohead song out now. When they wrote the song, they were actually in a band called Porcupine Tree, who had a hit with it. They were like a new "Radiohead". This song is not a great song, but it is a great song. It's a great song for the summer.
