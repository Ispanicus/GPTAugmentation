Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

The following songs are not available on Spotify. However, you can still listen to them as a free, ad-supported radio service.

A:

I have a couple of questions:

(2) On the first playlist, there are many of the songs that are in the playlist that have not yet been released to Spotify.  Is this a deliberate decision by Spotify to not have them available?

A:

As I understand it, Spotify do not have the ability to offer ad-supported radio service, because they have to pay the radio providers for the privilege.  
It seems to me that this can be a long running issue and that the reason for it is that the radio player companies have a vested interest in having a successful service, but also because they don't want to lose money on their own radio player.  If they lose money on a service, then they will be less likely to do it themselves.  
In order for the service to be successful, it needs to be able to attract advertisers who pay for it, and have a good track record of getting listeners to sign up and pay.

(3) On your second playlist, I don't see anything in it that suggests that the song was released to Spotify.  I would have assumed that Spotify don't have rights to anything released by the artist.  

A:

(1)  I am not aware of Spotify's policy regarding what gets released to the service.  However, I can confirm that the songs on the playlist that you have posted are unavailable, however, they may be available to you as a free service.  You will have to contact your local radio station to find out if they are willing to play the songs in their playlist.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I was told at the time of the issue of this album that the only reason I would have a problem with it being pirated would be if I bought it and didn't get the CD. I did get the CD. When I got it I thought "Wow, I'm getting a great album." I've found out now that this is a pirated CD that has been put out there by a company that is very highly sought after. So, if you want a great album, or you want to send a message to the company that is putting out this album, this is the CD for you.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Terry Fator. I have been buying his records for years and have always been amazed how well thought out and produced his albums are. What I am trying to say is that I have heard so many people say that his albums are well thought out and produced but that they are so poorly produced that it makes them sound amateurish. This album is not only well thought out and produced but it's also very well produced and well done. This is one of the best albums that Terry Fator has ever put out. I would buy this album again any day.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.

Upon further listening, I realized that the music is not really country at all, but rather a pop or R&B sound. When I was younger I was told that there was a "country" sound, but I never heard any country music, so in a way I believe it is a country. When I first heard the song "I Can't Be Satisfied", it sounded like something by Prince, but upon closer listening, I realized it is an original song. The song "Don't Play That Song" is the only song I was unsure about, but after listening to it again, I realized it is a very good song. There is no one song that I do not like on this album. The songs are very good.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

The song selection is terrible and when you go to view the track listing it just shows songs that have no pictures in the track listing. I could not even listen to the tracks because I was too annoyed. The only good thing about this CD is that you can skip songs without having to wait for the next song you want to hear.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think this is bad, but I have mixed feelings about it. The drums are good, and the guitars are okay, but I don't like the guitars' sound because it's too distorted. The vocals are okay, but they're not particularly memorable, and I like the song a lot. I don't think the album will be a huge hit, but you may just want to give it a try.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really don't want to write much more of my review than that, but I have to bring up the one thing that could have been improved. The song "Unsatisfied" is a boring, droning song which takes about eight and a half minutes to get through, and the song never really changes. It's a song you could sit through endlessly, and in that sense, it's better than most of the other songs on the album. It's just a boring song, and it's a boring album, period.

The only other thing I'd say is that there are some songs that are better than the rest, but none of them are really memorable.

This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA band's version of "Soon!", and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, you don't need to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If, however, you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weak song on it), get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If it's for the narration, don't bother. It's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages in the book, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not good. There are some good songs on the second side of this album, and it's not half bad. I can't say it's a great album, though. It's a decent album, but it's not really a good album and it's a decent album that's a decent album. It's not bad, but it's not really a good album. There are very few songs on this album that I like, and most of them are the weakest ones on the album.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, I'm a big fan of the album, the flow is good, the beat is good, and the lyrics are good, but that's not what makes this album great. The best thing about this album is that it is an excellent soundtrack to the movie "Mallrats", by the way, i recommend this album to anyone who likes the movie or the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a massive fan of The Neptunes and I've been listening to this album every night since I ordered it. It has some killer songs on here. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. This is definitely the best mixtape album you'll ever hear. I'm not going to give any tracks, but I will tell you that you can't go wrong with the tracks that you should put on your mixtape. Just sayin'.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The second album by the Neptunes. This is definitely not the best mixtape, but it is definitely a nice album. The beats are not that good, but the music is not bad. Most of the songs are very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album in a long time, but I remember enjoying listening to it in the early 90's when I was really into the Neptunes. I'm not a huge hip-hop head by any means, but this album does have a few good tracks. This is not a bad album, but it wasn't as great as I remembered it being before I got so caught up in the Neptunes. I would recommend it to people who like hip-hop, but most of all it should be listened to by those who have been hip-hop fans since the 90's.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: An average mixtape album. Not a bad mixtape, but not great. I still like the majority of tracks on this mixtape, but there are a few tracks that really just don't make sense on this mixtape. I think I'll stick with my normal mixtape.
