Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It's a strange thing, but I've always loved R.I. and wanted to buy the "official" version, because I've always been a fan of the group.  But, by the time you get to the end of the album, you kind of realize how bad it really is.  The first three tracks are pretty good, but after that, it just sounds like a band that's been drinking and playing their instruments for a year.  I hope someone can fix this.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  One of the greatest albums of all time.     I was very excited to get this album (and all the other ones by this group).     This album is an amazing collection of songs.    I am a huge fan of Twiztid, so getting this album was a treat.    I have not been able to find a copy of the original cassette version, which I am sure is also very rare, but I think it is worth a listen.  The sound quality on this one is pretty amazing and I think the CD's are also pretty good.    The production on this one is great.     The lyrics are great as well.     This album is definitely a must have!

Amazon review:  This album is a compilation of tracks from other artist.    This is a great album and I am glad I chose it.     For what it is worth, I think the group is great.     The group has a great sound and the songs are great.     Some of the tracks are very repetitive and boring.     The group is still touring and I think they are doing great things.     I would recommend this to anyone I know and they are definitely worth a listen.

Amazon review:  This is a great album!    I was very excited to get this album.    This is certainly one of the greatest albums of all time.     I have listened to all of the albums of the group so far and this one is definitely the best.     The production on this one is great.    The group sounds great and the songs are great.    The lyrics are great as well.    I would definitely recommend this to any fan of hip hop.

Amazon review:  I first heard this group on the soundtrack to the movie The Player.     I have listened to them since then and now I am a huge fan.     I have been listening to this group since the beginning of time.     I like the group's original music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have been listening to this song on repeat every day this week. It is a really great song, but I think the lyrics are a bit off. I am glad I read your review, and thank you for that. I was just wondering if you could help me out here. I am trying to figure out what is wrong with my lyrics.

I have a feeling that they are off. They sound a lot like this:

I never thought I'd get a chance to love a girl like that.I never thought that I'd lose my head like that.

I think that they should be:

I never thought I'd get a chance to love a gal like that. I never thought that I'd lose my head like that.

I've been listening to this song all day with the lyrics in the background. Is the first line on the song supposed to be "I never thought I'd get a chance to love a gal like that" or "I never thought that I'd lose my head like that"? I am at a loss.

Hey, thanks for your review! As far as my lyrics go, it's not that they are off. It's just that I have not thought about them that much. Perhaps I am not really thinking about it enough. I think that I've been writing the song as opposed to thinking about it, but I have no clue.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Just thought i would share my opinion of this cd.  First off, i love the songs, the melodies and lyrics.  I am not a Christian but i do like music with a Christian flavor.  The only negative i have is the sound quality.  But that might just be me.  The sound is very poor which is disappointing, but not a huge deal.  The other negative is the cover art.  It is not good.  The pictures are very poor.  The overall package is very poor.  Overall, i give this a high four.  I will purchase this cd again if i need to.  This is a great cd for those who want to listen to Christian Rock/Gospel.  I am glad I bought this cd.  I will buy it again.  If they would just focus on the good parts, instead of the bad parts, they would have a better product.  I am sad that the CD is over 2 years old.  I love the album.  I will buy the CD again.

I do not like the album cover or the title.

Amazon review: I love the songs, the lyrics and the artwork.  I have listened to it twice.  I found the lyrics to the songs to be very inspirational.  I have been very very fortunate to have been able to work with Christian artists.  I have listened to one of the artists play at my church, and it was one of the best services I have ever attended.  That is why I am so blessed to have been able to work with such great artists.  I am sorry that the album has been out for so long.  I will not buy it again.  There is no need for this type of music on Christian radio.  I will not buy this CD again.

I thought it would be a bit different from the other Christian albums that i have heard, but it is not.  If you want to listen to Christian Rock or Gospel then this album is a great buy.
