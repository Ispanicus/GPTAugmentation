Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: There is no one song that is "the" song for me. I like "I Believe" and "The Great Divide" and the other tracks are all good. But they are all very different, and you have to decide whether it's "Good" or "Better". For me, though, the best song is the first one, "I Believe."

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This album has a lot of Christian music, but it also has a lot of Christian music mixed in with it.  I think one of the best is "Let's Talk About the Good Things in Life",  that was a great song and a great song choice.  This CD is good but not great.  I feel like the music was taken from another genre of music while I was listening and has been changed and mixed with Christian music. I would like to see the music return to its original form.  Tom Scott is not a very well known artist, so I think it is safe to say that he is not a very good musician.  I think the music would be better without the Christian music, but I need to listen to music from other genres that is not Christian music.  Overall, I like this CD.  I have to say, if you are a follower of Christ, then you should look out for Tom Scott.  He does a good job of singing and playing Christian music.  You can tell a lot of love and a lot of passion for Christ in the music he sings.  I don't listen to Christian music, so I didn't do much research into the artists of Christian music.  I just listened to the music and liked it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was supposed to be a Christian album, but it does not matter that he is Christian.  I don't care.

I don't think that there is anything bad in this album.  I really like this album and I like Tom Scott.  I have been searching for this type of music and this album makes me want to buy more Tom Scott albums.  I love Tom Scott and I thought this might be a good album to review.  I have been searching for something like this for a long time and this is one of the few that I have found.  This is not a bad album, in fact it is a good album, but I do not think that it is very Christian.  I do not think that it should be called a Christian album.  I would give this album a 4.5, but I don't think it should be ranked above the other albums of Tom Scott.

Amazon review: This is Tom Scott's third album.  I think I have heard him sing this album before,  but this is the first time I have listened to it.  It is very good and I would recommend it to those who like Tom Scott's music.  It has a lot of different styles of music, and I would like to hear more.  This album is good, but I do not think it is great.  I do not think that it should be placed higher than the other albums of Tom Scott.  It is a good album that you will enjoy, but I think it does not make Tom Scott's music one of the greats.  I do not think Tom Scott has a very unique voice, but I do think that his voice does fit some great songs.  This is my first Tom Scott review, and I hope to continue to review his albums.  I have a few reviews of his other albums, but this is the first one that I have heard.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

They are one of my favorite bands ever.  I love their music, and I love Dave Clark.  I have every CD by the Dave Clark Five I can get my hands on, and I have always loved all the songs he sang.  I own his Greatest Hits album and Greatest Hits Volume 2.  I'm almost a Dave Clark fan, in fact I'm going to buy a CD signed by him.  I bought this album with the intention of buying all of his albums, but I have decided to buy just this one, I love this album, and I know it will be great.

Amazon review: Dave Clark Five - "Bury Me at Wounded Knee"  Not bad for a group of men who couldn't write a song let alone a complete album.

Amazon review: Dave's Greatest Hits is definitely one of my favorite albums.  I think the majority of people agree with me.  The album was a huge success.  It is now certified gold, which means it has sold more than 1 million copies.  The album has sold more than 3 million copies.  The album is currently in the Top 10 of Billboard's Hot Country Albums.  It is also in the Top 10 of Billboard's Top R&B Albums.

Amazon review: I have 2 songs by the Dave Clark Five on my "Hits" CD.  I listen to David Lee Roth quite often when I'm not listening to the Dave Clark Five, and I usually listen to both songs, but I'll listen to one or the other.  I definitely agree to what has been said about the song, and I don't like it.  I think the song is a lot shorter than the other songs on the album, and I think it's kind of the same type of song as "I Can't Stand Myself", which is another song on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was surprised to see how much I liked the Dave Clark Five.  They are a really great band.  When they were on tour, I would always buy their CD, even if I didn't like it.  I have heard a lot of complaints about this album, but I don't think they were all from people who didn't like the album.  I think it has some redeeming qualities.  The lyrics are good, and the music is pretty good.  I would have liked to have heard more from them on the album though.  They are a really great band.  They really deserve a lot of credit for being so successful.

Dave Clark is a great singer.  I have heard him sing before, but I have never heard anyone sing like him.  He has a really great voice.  I have no problem with the song.  The song is nothing like what I expected.  I liked the song, but I'm not going to listen to it again.

So I can't wait to listen to it.  I like this CD quite a bit.  I will definitely buy the CD again.  I am a fan of Dave Clark.  When he is on I like him.  I have a lot of Dave Clark CD's.  He is my favorite singer.  I will give this album 5 stars.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A very good release. The music is very nice and the sound is good. I was not able to find the video but do check the link below.  I've listened to the CD on my way to and from work. I really like this album. This is my first CD where I do not like the music. Some of the songs are very good but some are just not for me. The only one I will listen to again is "The Last Temptation of Christ", I think that is the best song. The lyrics are very sad and that is a good thing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to the CD twice in the last few weeks. I have not heard it before. I was impressed with the quality of the recording and the attention to detail in the production. I was not, however, impressed with the sound quality. It sounds like it was recorded in a single room. It is not bad, but it is not good. I would have liked to have had the sound of the instruments and the voices in the mix. I've heard similar recordings with better sound quality, but it is nice to have it on CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of this recording for more than ten years. It has been a favorite. I have listened to it frequently and find it of interest. I have also been greatly impressed by the musicianship of the group. The performances are solid and well-rounded. The best part of this recording is the way it is recorded. I have no doubt that the sound quality will be top-notch.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to it many times over the last few years, always with positive reviews, but I have to say that I have been very disappointed. I was looking forward to it. I have listened to it a couple of times and I have to say, it has been disappointing. The sound quality is not good. It is OK, but not great. It is not a bad recording, but it is definitely not worth $50. I am very disappointed. I have to say, I was not expecting much. I was not impressed by the performance at all. I have to say, this was expected before I bought it. I have listened to it about 10 times and I still do not like it. I have to say, I was very disappointed and disappointed with this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Just bought this. I must say I was expecting something very different from the previous releases I've bought... but it was disappointing. Very disappointed. The sound is very good, but the vocals are too high and the sound is not clear. I would say I have heard worse from a recording.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit I wasn't very impressed with this new album. I was hoping for something different and this was not it. The sound quality is adequate but the vocals/music are very annoying. I was expecting something very different from the previous releases and was not disappointed. The tracks were too long and I wanted to hear something new. The production was okay but the vocals were very annoying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've only listened to this once so far and I've been pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is very good and the songs are quite good. I'm not really sure what the problem is, but I am sure it is not the sound quality. The only problem I have is that the vocals are very annoying. This is a very good recording and I plan on buying the CD soon.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music is pretty good. The sound isn't great, but it's not bad. The only gripe I have is that the vocals are very annoying. Like most recordings that have been made after the recording of Abbey Road, the vocals sound too high in the mix. This is probably the only reason I bought this. It could easily be a one-dimensional recording. I'll probably buy them all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the good reviews. I've listened to it many times and it's still too much of a hassle to delete and re-download because of the horrible music. I'm not really into the music genre, so I'm not sure what is worse. I don't like the sound, but I like the music. I don't know what else to say.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Is not the same song on the movie.  This version is terrible even tho it's the original, I like the movie version way better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite song from O'Hearn. I have always loved this song, in fact, I have been listening to it since I was very small, since I could hear it on the radio most of the time. I have always found this song to have a very calming and peaceful feel to it. I love to sing it to myself, especially when I am very anxious or nervous. It actually helps me calm down without taking any medications.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was looking for a song when I first heard this one on the station, and it was a real stand out. I liked it and bought it and put it on my mp3 player. I never got around to hearing it on the movie soundtrack (I didn't own one of the stereo's when I listened to it), and I am glad I did not because I think it is one of the best songs in the movie.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is about the love of the one your with and the joy that you experience when you know she loves you. It is not a 'love song' but a song that is about the love that a person has for another. It is a true classic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song was played during the end credits. It was the last song played at that point, and I enjoyed it very much. I was surprised the song was included as it was not the most popular song in the movie.

Amazon review - I love this song, and I have been singing this song on my ipod for the last month. It is one of my favorite songs of all time. It's about a girl and her dog, and how they love each other.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this song since I was a kid, and I've loved it for as long as I can remember. I don't really like this song any more, but it's still a great song. I like to sing this song to myself when I'm feeling blue, depressed or a little down about life.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Beatles, especially the White Album and Sgt. Pepper.  This version of "I'll Get You" is by far my favorite.  I have heard every version of this song and this is one of the best.  If you like the Beatles, you won't like this one, but it is good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The only thing I dislike about this album is that it has no bass.  I don't have a bass guitar, but even if I did have one, it wouldn't be used for much else besides strumming.  I was hoping it would be more like Sgt. Pepper.  I mean, the rhythm section isn't there, but, then again, I don't know what you'd do without bass anyway.  It's okay, but I am very disappointed.  I was hoping it would be a complete rock & roll album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good album, but not really all that memorable.  I would like to hear it again just for the songs by the new guy.  I am not very big on new guys, but I really like the new guy's voice.  I wish he would have produced the new album after this one.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: This is a great CD - if you like the Beatles, you will love this album.  The songs are very good, and they don't get boring.  They are all good, but it's hard to get very excited about a single song on an album.  I will definitely buy this album again.
Sentiment: Positive

(All reviews are in the order they appeared)

###
Amazon review: I have no idea what to say, except that it is a great album.  This is one of my favorites.  The only thing to watch out for is that the last song on the album is a duet between John and Paul.  I have heard this song played by all the other Beatles, and I didn't recognize the voice of John and Paul at all.  Anyway, it's good for the Beatles fans that like the Beatles, and I can't wait to play this album again.  It's a must have.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had to get this album because it was one of the first I purchased, and I love it.  The cover is great, and the CD itself is nice.  The songs are all good, but I think the title track is the best.  I also think the album could have been shorter.  I think the CD could have been cut to 7 songs instead of 8.  All in all, I really like this album, and I will buy it again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I got this because it was on my wish list, and I liked it.  I thought the first one was good, but this one is better.  The songs are very good, and I enjoy them.  I like the songs, but the only thing that is missing is one song that the Beatles didn't write (which is very unusual).  The songs are not very long, and I think the songs could have been played in a different order.  It's a great album, and I am gonna buy it again.
Sentiment: Positive

I like Laren because of her voice. I like her sound. I like her lyrics.              But what I don't like is the way she writes the songs. For example, I don't like songs like "You" or "You Belong to Me."               And "It's You" is just okay. I just don't like it.             -

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I don't think this song is all that great, personally.  I think it would have been better to have the same opening chorus as "Some Good Years".  The song's lyrics are really sad, and it's also a little boring.  The melody is fairly good, I guess.

Amazon review: The band playing "I've Got the World on a String" in the opening of this movie was one of those songs you could hear the entire movie with just one song.  A little background in the history:  The first time this song was ever played in a movie was in the 1937 movie The Wizard of Oz.  It was used to warn Dorothy that her life is in danger.  She is now the queen of Oz.  The original movie version was an instrumental with no vocals, that was then later re-recorded with the vocals.  I remember seeing the movie in the theater and hearing the movie sound like the song was playing.  I was very impressed.

Amazon review: I can't get over how great this song sounds.  The bass, drums, and guitar are great together.  The lyrics are great, but if you want to hear the song without the lyrics, skip to the last two minutes.  I always listen to the whole song first, so I guess the lyrics are there to explain the song.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

The cd didn't have all the songs that were listed on the back of the cd, but it did have about 4 songs that were really good though.  The most interesting thing about this cd was that it is a really good cd for those people who want to hear something different.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition.  I like downloading the.mp3's from Amazon - the process is easy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Most songs were lousy; she sings better by herself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: An album that I downloaded for a friend's birthday, but wasn't disappointed in.  I'm a fan of her music and have always admired her work.  The only thing that keeps me from putting this one on my list is her lyrics.  It is very typical of pop music, and although I enjoy it, it is one of the reasons I have never been able to appreciate her work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is very repetitive.  I've listened to it a few times and I'm not happy with it.  I'm not a fan of repetitive songs, but she does a good job at it.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album and listened to it as I was driving.  It was a good album.  I wanted to keep it but decided against it.  I enjoyed the album, but my favorite song was "If Only".  The other songs were good but I didn't like them all.  The song itself is okay, but it just didn't fit with all the other songs on the album.  The lyrics of the songs were average.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my second time downloading this album.  I was not disappointed with the first time.  The only songs that were a let down were "If Only" and "I Don't Wanna Take it All Away".  I still like this album, but I don't like it as much as I like her first album.  I'm not sure what happened with her second album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I downloaded this album yesterday for a friend who has never had a cd player.  I don't know what I was expecting when I downloaded this album.  The album is okay, but it is just not very original.  It has the same music, but it just doesn't stand out from the other tracks.  The lyrics are decent, but I don't think they are very interesting.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
