Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: In the beginning of the first chapter, the narrator describes what things looked like before they were ruined. It is a moving story. It is tragic. It talks about the people before the time of the flood. It is a touching account of a family of a man, his wife and his daughter. It makes you question the reasons as to why so many people died. I feel like it is a story of hope and forgiveness. I am thankful that the author wrote this book. The story is so moving, I feel the author had to go through so much pain. I love this book. It is a very well written book. I am glad that the author wrote this book.

Amazon review: Good for a rainy day, or if you are looking for a good, non-threatening book that might help someone.

Amazon review: This book was the first one I read a while back about a woman who was in a coma. At the time I didn't understand what it was all about, but I am glad that I did. This book is a story of a woman who was in a coma for two years, and the author wrote a book about her life. At the time I didn't understand what was going on. I was just taking in the story and enjoying it. This book takes you on a journey where you will see why she was in a coma, and why she still wasn't talking, and how she ended up with a baby. This book is very interesting and I thought it was very inspiring.

Amazon review: It's the story of a man who was raised in the same house as his father for nearly all his life. He was raised to believe that his father is a bad man. But as he gets older, he begins to see his father differently. The story is about a man who is trying to understand his father, and the choices he has made in his life. I think that you will learn a lot about where you are coming from, and what you are thinking about.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

I'm a fan of Slipknot, and I would've bought it but it was sold out in the mall. I know they tour once a year, but I was a little disappointed. I just don't need another one of those albums. It's like when you order a pizza but it's late and you order the wrong thing, etc. Now it's like that with Slipknot. They're not a band that you should be spending your money on. I did order a cd of the "Duality" and it was a very good album, but I was looking for a Slipknot album and they didn't have it. I am glad that I didn't buy it, but I think I would've been disappointed if I didn't buy the Slipknot album.

I don't understand why people are like this. People have their opinion of a band, and they can't be satisfied. If people can't be satisfied with the band, then they don't deserve to be a band. This band has the most talent and most members. I still love the music of this band, and I am so glad that they are still going strong. I don't think that this band is going to be remembered for the next 10 years. They did what they did, and they did well. I would have bought this album, but it was sold out at the mall.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

I know this is a stupid question, but do we really need to know where the lyrics of this song come from?  Why is this such an important song to know the lyrics to?  I guess we all need to know that.  I'm not sure why we need to know the lyrics to a song that has one of the stupidest lyrics ever.  What's the point in knowing what the lyrics sound like?  It doesn't matter if the song is "Gonna leave it all behind"  It doesn't matter if the song is "I can't live without you"  It doesn't matter if the song is "I love you so much"  It doesn't matter if the song is "It's almost over"  If you don't know the lyrics to a song, you are stupid.  I'm sorry, but it seems like I'm the only person who likes this song.  It's like the only song I know.  It's the only song I can't stop listening to.  I guess I just can't get over the fact that it's a song that I hate.  I can't even talk about this song without getting upset and crying.  I'm just not going to comment on it.

Amazon review: This is a very good sounding horn that I could play around with as my main horn in my high school band, and I would like this to be one of the standard horn instruments I play to accompany my band. The sound is bright, rich and warm, but a little on the thin side. I am very happy to own this horn, except that it is not the horn I got in the 90's. I have a lot of horns from the 90's that I don't have the money to buy again, but I would like to get this one.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Prince since his days with The Revolution.  He had a way of taking the lyrics of a song and making it more personal and meaningful.  This was a very good CD and will be one that I use for the rest of my life.  The original version of "Cream" is very good and was one of his best.  "If I Was Your Girlfriend" is a very good song and is one that I listen to on a regular basis.  "Halo" is a very good song and one of my favorites.  I listened to it over and over again for a year and it still gets me every time and it never gets old.  This CD is a must have.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have the original album, which I own, and have used it several times.  I now own the re-issue of this album which came in a special sleeve that is not available anywhere else.  The sleeve is very nice and the cover art is very well done.  I can't wait to listen to this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The original album is fantastic.  I have used it on several occasions and it has been a favorite album of mine.  The re-issue is very nice and has the original artwork and liner notes.  I bought this album around Christmas time and the music I was listening to was not what I would have expected from a re-issue.  The sound quality is very good and the lyrics are better.  This has been one of my favorite albums from the past.  I have listened to the other versions of this album and they are all superior in quality to the original.  This is a very good album.

Amazon review: Prince was one of the first pop music icons to use synthesizers in a way that was not only beautiful, but also unique.  There are many other artists who have incorporated synthesizers in their songs, but he was the first to use it to enhance the sound.  The original release of this album is very good.

Amazon review: I have heard the album before, but when I got the CD today, I was unable to get it to play.  It is a very good album.  I have been in the music business for over 20 years and have used many different types of music CD's, and this is by far the best I have used so far.  I have no idea what happened to the CD's that I have had in my possession for years.  They all had scratches on them, but I could still hear the music.  When I got this CD, I was told the recording was excellent, but when I played the music back, it was scratched.  I have not had a CD of this quality and the music is excellent.  I would like to hear it on the radio.  I have heard the album before, but when I got the CD today and tried to listen to it, the CD would not play.  It is a very good album, and I would like to hear it on the radio.

Amazon review: I've been a Prince fan for a long time.  He was always one of the first artists that I heard.  I first heard The Revolution in the late 70's.  Over the years, I have used this album and it always has been my favorite.  I have also used the Prince II album, which many say is the best album Prince ever made.  I have also used the Platinum Edition, which has more songs than the regular edition.  This album has been my favorite since the original release.  It is very well put together, the sound quality is amazing and the lyrics are very good.  I have been collecting Prince albums since the late 70's and this is the best one I have ever used.

I have listened to all of the songs and I agree with the other reviewer it is worth it to buy this album but it is not worth the money.

I have to say that I am not entirely satisfied with my purchase. It is a good song and I am glad I purchased the album. However, the song "In the End" is missing from the CD. I was able to locate it for you but it is a little slow for my tastes. I also was unable to locate "We'll Meet Again" which is also missing. This is a good CD. I'm sorry that I didn't purchase the CD sooner and I hope you will consider getting them corrected.

Good CD, but some of the songs need to be added to the CD. I loved the CD, but I feel that some songs should be added, I will buy again.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I bought this product for my daughter who was about to start taking piano lessons.  The CD is very nice, the only thing that bothers me is that the recording quality is low, but this is a CD that I will buy again.  I will purchase another of the product's in the future.

Amazon review: I bought the product for my son and daughter.  The CD is good, but I think the quality is low.  I am not sure if that is the actual reason or not, but I would like to say that the packaging is nice and the recording quality is good.  The music and the voice of the artist are very good.  I would give it a four out of five rating.  I would recommend the product to other parents of young children.  I would also recommend parents buy another one of the products.  This is a good product for children to listen to.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: I have yet to find any of the other covers that are on this CD. I purchased this CD, just to get access to the cover of "This Land Is Your Land" which I have been wanting to get for a while. The lyrics are excellent and the song is a great version of the song.
