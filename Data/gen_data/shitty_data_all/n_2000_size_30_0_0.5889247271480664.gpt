Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

Amazon review: I was pretty disappointed with this album. I was expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work I'd been seeing on her videos. It just wasn't there for me. I will still play it but it won't be one of my favorites. My advice would be get a new producer.

Amazon review:  This is a nice song.  It has a nice beat and is a mellow rock song. I liked the lyrics and thought the melody was nice.  The song was a little long for me.  It was a nice song.  There was a little bit of an instrumental jam at the end.  I would buy this song just for that.

However, I do wish Floyd would have just left the lyrics to the song alone, cause I really don't understand how anyone could not like this album.

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I did not like this CD.  I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review:  I thought the music was very nice and the lyrics were good, so I bought this album.  I thought it was a great album and thought it would be a nice addition to my collection.  However, I have to say there are some songs that I could not understand and thought the song was not sung correctly.  For example, "If you wanna be a star, do you have to be a loser?"  is very catchy.  The lyrics to "I don't want to be a star, but I would rather be a loser" are very clear.  "I don't wanna be a star, I would rather be a loser"  is a bit confusing.  "I don't wanna be a star, but I could be a loser"  is very funny.  "I don't wanna be a star, I would rather live with a loser"  is not very funny.  "I don't wanna be a star, but I don't wanna be a loser"  is also not very funny.  So, I would like to see a better performance of this song, if possible.

Amazon review: I was a bit concerned when I saw that the CD was being sold for $2.99, but I figured, hey it's only music so why not - it's $2.99.  I thought this CD was a good buy, and when I got it, I played it several times and liked it a lot.  I thought it was a nice little album that might not be worth it, but if I was in the market for a new album, I would buy this one.  I think it is a good album that would make a nice addition to any collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The most famous song on this CD is "Scentless Apprentice" which I have never heard anywhere else aside from this CD, and I have been listening to this CD for a long time.  I enjoy the song, but I have to say, it is not as good as it was back in the 70's.  The music is very nice, but it is not the same as back in the 70's.  The song is very nice, but the music is a bit on the thin side.  The lyrics are great, but the music is very thin.  I think this one is a better buy than other CDs on the market.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: While the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to Dylan's Judas moment, I still recommend this wonderful series. My baby fell asleep within 20 minutes of first firing it up, and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for The Pixies to share with me in the future. The Stones one is good too.  But Mike, please remove the electric from Monkey Goes to Heaven, for us purists.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a great album, not just for the music but for the way it was put together.  It is a combination of different styles, including many I never would have thought to put on an album.  And not all of the songs are the usual favorites, either.  But for every song that I could have been looking forward to hearing, there was one or two I did not like and thought they had no place in the album.  So it is a great album and a great mix of styles.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I can't believe that the album didn't hit a whole lot harder and faster.  And I can't believe that they were able to get such a great sound with the technology that they had.

Amazon review:  This album is good, but I don't think that it is that great.  The first two songs on it are very good, but the rest is not.  That is the best way I can describe it, and the reason why I am not as impressed as I was before I heard the album.

Amazon review: Her music is horrible and she supports, endorses, and sleeps with Lilo Brancato, a cop killer.

Amazon review:  This review is for a book by a man named Dan Enchautegui.  I have already read the book and found it to be a good read, but the music was so bad  I had to buy it so I could listen to it.  I am surprised that you can buy a book that has so much positive and this one so bad that you have to buy it.  The author even goes so far as to say "I am an advocate for peace" and yet he is a staunch opponent of the cop killer Lilo Brancato.  He is a racist, a bigot, and a misogynist.  He is the worst of all of them  but the music is so bad that I had to buy it so I could listen to it.

If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

It's got some great songs, but the ones that stand out to me are "Hey Bulldog" and "I'm the Greatest", both with great lyrics.  The other songs are just okay.  There is a difference between good music and great music.  This album is very good music.  It's very hard to find great Beatles music.  They have been so overplayed for so long, that most people don't know what they have missed

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country.

No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: The vast majority of this CD are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice. Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Try any of the others you find here instead.  In fact this is so badly misrepresented by Amazon by using the wrong reviews I'm going to ask for my money back.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review:  "You're My Soul" is a very good tune to help you get to sleep.  However, even with the help of this song, it's hard to fall asleep - and even harder to stay asleep.  As the song fades out, you may start to drift in and out of consciousness while thinking, "I'll be damned - I have to go to work tomorrow."  The song also contains the lyrics "I'm not a child, I'm an old man."  This is a very nice idea, but you have to wonder if it was ever used in actuality, or just in the lyrics to make the song more interesting and interesting.  As you may have guessed, I gave this CD only a 1 rating for this reason.  This CD is a big hit with the "Wisdom of the West" crowd, but I guess they're not the ones to decide what's right and wrong.

"You're My Soul" - Jimmy Buffett & Keith Richards

This is a great rockin' song about a man who is so good at singing that he has all the women in the world in his life.  This is a song I can watch the movie of with my grandkids.  It's a good tune.  Go buy it.  But don't just listen to it - sing it too.

Amazon review: I can't say I agree with your 1 star rating of this CD.  I think it's a fine CD.  I give it a 3 star rating just because of the price.  But it's a good CD.  I wouldn't even buy it unless I had to, because I'm afraid that even with the price tag, there would be no way I could afford it.  I think a 3 star rating would be more appropriate, though.

"You're My Soul" - Jimmy Buffett & Keith Richards (Sally)

Another song about a man who is a very good at singing, and the woman who is a very good at singing for him.  And he has her in his life.  When he sings this song, I want to hear the women sing it too.  I hope that song never gets played on the TV series "The Singing Detective."

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: I have seen them 5 times over the last three years and they always put on a great show. This is my favorite of the bunch. I think this is the best version of the song. It is very melodic and I think the band (which is great) is the key to why it is so great. I have seen them all over the world. They bring a lot of energy to the stage.

Amazon review: "The Music Man" was one of the first albums I bought on vinyl when I was a teenager. I had never heard of Barry Altschul, and I was a bit leary of him, but I was also curious to see what he actually sounded like. It was like discovering a new planet. The album is a tribute to the music of the 60's. It is truly a beautiful album.

Amazon review: If you like the music of the 60's, then you will enjoy this album. Although I'm not a big fan of the group, this is one of the few recordings that I actually like. The vocals are great, and the music is very good. The original score is great, and the songs are very catchy.

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating.

Amazon review:  This album is a real mixed bag.  I love the album concept of bringing together the two former members of the hip hop group Outkast and putting them together again. The album is full of catchy songs that have really great hooks but the production is off. The songs are lacking the smoothness that we are used to from the group. Their chemistry is still there, but they have lost their soul and soulful production.  The other songs are good, but they lack the energy that we are used to from the group.

How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.  I have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above afflictions is listen to "Eye Of The Tiger". This song will cure any mental ailment. They you should have it pumping through the streets of Alaska during the dark parts of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review:  Nothing but praise here - as this is the best song of the year!

It is a great message of encouragement, because it reminds us that we can all do anything we set our mind to.  And it is a great song to be in your life because it is infectious.

I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

This is a very good piece. It has a nice sound, but there are certain times when the chords would change a little, and even play with the keys a little, but overall it has a very good sound.
