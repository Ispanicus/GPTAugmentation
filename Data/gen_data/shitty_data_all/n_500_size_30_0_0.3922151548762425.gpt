Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I've played the song a few times, trying to figure out what it is. It takes me back to the old days when I was 16: the only place to go was to go to a live concert. This was our very own "Cake Sale". The band was the Rude Boyz. The song was called "This is The Night". I don't think the song is about buying a cake, so I don't really know what it is about. I hope it is not about the same as the "Sweet 16" song.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

I wish he would sing like this more often.

Amazon review: The only thing I don't like about this CD is that it is a little short.  I like that it's not really a solo record; it's more of a duet album.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Hi,

I have a problem with my ipod. I have tried everything I can think of. I have tried pluging it in and out to see if it was loose in the slot. What happens is that it comes on but then I can no longer hear it. I have tried turning it in and out as well as turning it up and down and also turning it off and on. It will only play for about 2 minutes and then it goes to silence. It will not let me play music on it. It will not even power on. I have taken off the headphones from it. I can also hear it but it will not let the music out. I have tried using the headphone jack and it still does not work. The headphones work fine when I put them on. It is an old ipod. It is blue and it has a red light on it. I have tried it with and without the cable. I have tried it with and without the headphones. I have tried it on and off. It will not even power on. I have tried it on a plane to try and see if it was loose. I have tried it in the car on and off. Nothing has worked. I have tried it at work and on my lunch break. Still nothing. I have tried plugging it into the computer. It still will not work. I have tried plugging it into the wall. Nothing. I have tried it at night and on. Nothing. I have tried turning it on and off every time. Nothing. I have tried using it for a few minutes and then turning it off. It still will not work. I have tried turning it on and off. It will not power on. I have tried plugging it in and out as well as turning it on and off. It will only play for about 2 minutes and then it goes to "silence" and then goes to silence.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I was expecting some new material with the title track, but all I get is a cover of Aimee Mann's "Mama's Child." I suppose this was the only way for the label to go with such an unpopular song, since they didn't have any original songs on the new album.

Amazon review: This was a compilation of songs the band had recorded throughout their career, the same format as the "Best Of" series.

And I think I'm in love with you.
And I just want to feel your arms around me.

I wanna make love with you in the dark.
I wanna hold you tight

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count).

Amazon review: I've been listening to this DVD over and over, but I still have not gotten a chance to watch the movie. There is so much information on this DVD - and I'm not talking about the songs. The information goes on for so long that I don't know what I am supposed to do with this information. So far, it's been a waste of money.

Amazon review: I think this is the most interesting of the three albums released by the Mayles Brothers. It is a very creative album with lots of interesting musical instruments, a mixture of folk and blues, and blues in a completely different way than most blues albums. I have listened to the CD almost constantly since it was released. I think this album is a true gem.

Amazon review: This is by far the most interesting of the three albums released by the Mayles Brothers. I had never considered "The Mayles Brothers" when I bought the first album, but I think I'll keep this one in my collection. The music is very good and the subject matter is very interesting. On the whole this is a very good album.

Amazon review: I was not a fan of Nirvana when I first heard them, but I've been listening to them since 1989 and have even played in a Nirvana cover band. I can tell you that they are very good musicians and the music is good, but I just don't think I would have the same level of respect if I saw the music that they have written themselves.

Amazon review: I saw this film on a TV in the theatre and it was quite different from what I was expecting. I was expecting a lot of "hair and make up" and "sexy" scenes, but instead I got a documentary with interviews from people who were there and from the people who were there with them. I really liked it.

Amazon review: This interview did not seem to be very focused on the making of the album "Nevermind" because it is very focused on the making of the movie. There are good interviews with the people who worked on the movie (Mark Mothersbaugh, Jonathan Demme, and others) but I feel that Mr. Demme left a lot out, which is not unusual. I thought that his answers were too long and too one sided. There are some good pictures in the documentary, but they do not really show the essence of the movie. The camera work is not as good as it should be.

Amazon review: I've heard several different versions of this song that I have not listened to enough to decide which is the best. I think that this is the most interesting, and the one that has the most variety. It has a good beat, a good melody, and it is written in a very good manner

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: This is the first album by Korn that I've heard since I joined "the Korn tribe."  It made no sense.  This is a compilation of random songs, mostly from Korn's old album, and it has some good songs and a couple of bad ones.  Still, for someone who has followed the band since the release of Born of Osiris, it's not a bad album.  The problem is, after the first few tracks, I don't know, man.  I don't understand it.  It's not like I expected anything other than "Born of Osiris" but it sounds like it.  It sounds like the bad Korn songs that I've heard before.  In fact, everything sounds like shit on this album, and not in a good way.  I don't know if it's the songwriter, the producer, the band members, or all of them working together.  I don't know, man, I just don't know.  It's not like I have to buy the album to figure out the issue.  Maybe someone else will figure it out, but I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying it for $5, and I'm not buying it because it is a compilation of songs from the most recent album.  I'm buying it because I love Korn, and I love it when Korn songs sound like this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I guess I can give this album a 5 star rating now.  I think I might have bought a bunch of Korn albums in the past, and this one is different from the rest.  I really like the songs, and I think that the songs on this album are among the best that I've heard in a long time.  I really like the lyrics, and I like not having to be in the band to like a song.  I think that this will be a permanent classic.  It's a nice change for me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just want to say that I've had this album for about a week now and I think I finally found it.  I bought it mainly because I heard "Contagious" and I thought "Wow, that's pretty.  I've been waiting for a Korn album that sounded like that.  That's the only reason I bought it.  The rest of the album is good but it didn't do it for me.  I also like the "Contagious" song a lot.  I was so happy when I heard it first and then I listened to it more and more and then I thought "Wait, that's stupid."  It's stupid.  I don't understand why they decided to put that stupid song on the album.

Amazon review: It's Korn!  The only album I've been on since my first listening to Korn.  It's been a long time since I've heard anything that sounds like this.

It was not to be though as this band is a big disappointment on this album.  They sound like they sound like crap.  I was really disappointed in this album, but I guess I'll stick to listening to classic Korn songs instead.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I was really hoping that this album would be different.  I mean, I was really hoping that they would be able to make a great album.  However, it seems more like a compilation of songs that were pulled from a previous album than one that is their own.  I can't imagine what I did wrong to not like this album.  I mean, I'm not going to buy stuff on purpose that I don't like, but I have to admit that this one was really rough for me.  This one is really lacking in originality, and I really wanted it to sound different.  However, I guess it

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Hello,
First of all, I must apologize for not getting the original review for sale for almost two months. I'm moving in a couple of weeks and had to sell my old CDs. It's all good now. By the way, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, for the great feedback and the great review.
I want to thank you for the opportunity to become a reviewer for Amazon. I think it's the best way to tell your friends about this amazing site.
I'm a fan of the band and also have a huge collection of their albums. I was very, very disappointed when I heard that they are not releasing new music anymore. It's really sad for me, because I've been a fan for so many years. I love the band, and I love their music. I have this album on vinyl, and I like to listen to it on vinyl as well. It's in perfect sound quality condition. I also just love the album's artwork, it's just awesome. All the songs are just as good as they are

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of music, you are more than likely going to love B.o.B's new album, which is called "My Life II".  We all know him as the rapper, which he is, but he is also a singer.  He also makes amazing music that has everyone from the media to the general public loving it.  It's like an album that is constantly changing, and growing.  This is what people are all about. This is what a rapper is supposed to do.  I was not a fan of the song "The World [Makes Me Feel]", which I felt was out of place.  I will give B.o.B credit though.  He put the music in his album, and made it sound good.

Now I have to listen to this disc, because I know I will like it.  I have never been so excited to listen to music.  I have never been so excited to listen to anything in my whole life.  I love her voice, but I will admit I do not like her music.  This is not about me liking music, this is about me liking the music I like.  I am in love with the song "No More".  I am in love with the music, I am in love with the singer, I am in love with the lyrics, I am in love with the song.  I am in love with the record, and I am in love with the album.  I could not put the disc on my stereo, because I would never buy it.  I would never even look at it.  But, I have to.  I have to listen to it.

If you just put the songs in the order they were written, it would make more sense.  But then, it would be pointless because people would just buy it and not listen to the songs.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The first album from this guy.  The lyrics are great and the music is great.  It's only a matter of time before his music starts getting mainstream attention.  The songs are good, but not great.

Amazon review: The album is awesome.  The only problem I had was the song "Just A Little Help".  It sounds like it would be perfect for a hip-hop/rap song, but it sounds like it was written and recorded by a country boy.  It's not a bad song, but it's nowhere near as good as the rest of the album.  The only way to get this album is buying it on digital download.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I don't know how I like it, but it's my first CD I've ever bought that I was so pleased with that I bought it again the next day.  I love it.  I've got the CD and LP (which I gave to my girlfriend as a gift).  I'm a little sad that the record company that made the album doesn't have the rights to make more CD's.  I'm going to buy the next one as soon as I can.

Amazon review: I've been looking for a band that I like, but the only ones that come to mind are the Ramones and the Talking Heads.  This band's music is very different from the other two, but it's really good, too.  The song "Love Is A Four Letter Word" is a very popular song on the radio, and is a good place to start.  I've heard it sung by other people, and it's a good song to sing along with.

Jim,
I can't think of any reason why this song would not belong on your site. I mean, after all, it's a popular hit. I can't think of anything to dislike about it except the fact that it's a ballad.
Anyhow, I suppose you could charge me $29.99, but I think that would be a bit much since I haven't even looked at the song, but it won't be the last time you hear it.

I think the best thing about this album is that it really has not been released yet. I would probably still buy this album when it is released. It is a great album.

I know a lot of people aren't fans of the band and I respect that, I do however feel that the band hasn't been doing as much as they should. I feel a lot of the songs on the album are very "simple" and I think the band needs to release more albums so that the fans can get to enjoy the full album. If they put out another album that can stand on its own, I am sure it will be a great album. I don't know if the band will ever release another album to be honest and I don't know if the band will ever get back to being a "big" band. But, I still love this band and I am very glad I found them.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the Beatles. I think the most talented band is Led Zeppelin. Their sound comes from pure genius.  I don't want to hear "Strawberry Fields Forever!" and "Stairway to Heaven!"  I'll go so far as to say that the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are the only bands that have a way with words that have never been equaled.  I'm a HUGE fan of the Beatles because they have the most unique sound and lyrics. They are one of the few bands that have consistently gone through a stylistic evolution.   I do not understand what is so great about the Beatles. I understand that they are great musicians, but they are not great writers.  The Beatles were like a child with a toy, and they kept on playing with it.  When they were done with their toy, they dumped it (with all the music still in it) in the closet and kept playing with it until someone started the cleanup.   What a waste.  When are people going to stop recycling.  This is a waste of time. The Beatles were the greatest band in the world.

Amazon review: The Beatles, especially Paul McCartney, had a very unique sound. This song is about how he wanted things to be, but he could not have them.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: What a lazy production from Pink Floyd as it's supposed last album. Very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a little disappointed with this record. I don't think it's a bad record per se, it's just not a great record. The tracks are all good, the production is good, and the lyrics are all good. Still, it's a little disappointing that the band didn't take a more intelligent approach to the album instead of just releasing a record with little to no thought put into the production or lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These guys made some great records in the 90s, but I just can't get into any of their new material, it sounds like they are trying to recapture the sound of the 90s, which I guess is a good thing in a way, but it also sounds like the band has become bored with making the same kind of music, and decided to rehash the same formula that they did 10 years ago. They should have at least attempted to write a new song or two, but instead they only seem to be trying to please everyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good band, but I'm not sure I can get behind a song called 'Lose My Mind' being used as the theme song to a new show. It's catchy, but it doesn't really make any sense.

Amazon review: This is the only album from this band I've heard, so I can't really tell you if it's a success or a failure. I do know that it's a great album. There are some great songs on this album, and they sounded great live.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is the only one of the group's I've heard that has really stuck with me. Lyrically, the band is very similar to their earlier releases. They have a great sound and a great groove. I like how it's a little more of a rock/metal album and not a jazz album. The saxophone is a nice addition, but they still sound very much like they are blues artists.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great album. You can really hear the band develop and refine their sound, and they are able to do it in a way that is very listenable, while still sounding like it is one of the most well-produced albums in their catalog.

I have heard this album and I think it's a great album, but for me I want to hear more of this band. The only negative I have to say about the album is that they don't really try to be great anymore, and the music is too much of the same thing.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

The lyrics are good, the melodies are good, the production is good, and it's not too hard to understand. The only complaint I have with this album is that it's not very long. I bought it for the music, and I'm not disappointed. The music is good, and the lyrics are good...but the album could be longer.

Amazon review: I bought this in order to find a suitable replacement for "The Art of Seduction" by David Gilmour. I've listened to it a few times, and the only thing that really keeps it from being my favorite is the constant repetition of "I want you, I want you, I want you", or "I want you, I want you, I want you". But, that's not to say that I don't like it, the music is good, and I'm glad I bought it, and will buy it again.

It's a good album I would recommend to anybody.

###
Amazon review: It's good, but I want a little more variety, I only bought it last year, and I like it, but there's nothing special about it, it's just typical new-wave pop with little variety in the music...but then again, that's what I like. The music is good, and the lyrics are good, and the music is good, and the lyrics are good.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: There are 4 tracks I can list as favorites; "Pleasure Kills" and "Hate Me Now".  The former has a very heavy "Korn" sound while the latter is a Korn-esque "Hardcore Alternative" sound to it.
