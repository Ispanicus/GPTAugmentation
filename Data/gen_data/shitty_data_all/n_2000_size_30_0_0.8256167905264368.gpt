Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: This is the music from the opening scene of the movie, Layer Cake, wherein Daniel Craig plays a fascinating, vulnerable role as a middle man for a "recreational medication" group in the UK.  Interesting concept for a movie, and the music grabs your attention, also.

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.

Amazon review: This disc contains the songs from the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series of albums, which are published by WR Records (Vol. 1-10).  Although it is an interesting concept for a movie, the songs are very generic, and nothing about the music grabs you.  If you are a fan of the  How-the-West-Was-Swung series, you do not  necessarily need this disc.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review: This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music? I'm serious.  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

Amazon review: George Carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects. He was creative and every time I listened to his other shows, I laughed so hard I had to stop the recording before I choked. His unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made George Carlin stand out from others in his field.  This album is not creative nor funny. It's just hateful. Mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops, fireman and snitches are, as well as fart and enema jokes.

Amazon review: This is the album of the year. I have always been a fan of the Grateful Dead. I have been listening to them for more than 30 years.  I was not sure about the name "Dead Or Alive" until I heard the song "The Other One" by Jello Biafra and it became clear that it was a cover of a live song. I am a fan of all the Dead and the band's music has always been a huge part of my life.  This album is full of songs from the entire career of the Grateful Dead. I have always been a fan of the Grateful Dead and I will always be a fan of the Grateful Dead.

It's a great album, but I'm not sure what the story is.

Amazon review: I've been watching the TV series "Criminal Minds" and every episode I was a little scared.  I didn't know what to expect, so I wasn't prepared for the way things would go.  The episode "Murder in the Second Degree" introduced me to the concept of a killer who is completely out of control and can only be stopped by a team that is together and knows exactly who the killer is.  I didn't know what to expect, so I wasn't exactly surprised to learn that he was there when I got home from work and that I would know him for the rest of my life.  I knew that he had a history of violent behavior and I knew that he would be a violent killer until he met me, but I didn't know that he would be that violent.

Cale's music is one of my favorites. This is a nice, laid back recording that I'd put in my collection. Cale had a unique sound, and the lyrics are well-crafted.

This album is an impressive collection of Cale's work. It's a little short, but that's due to the fact that Cale released several other albums in between, so he could release this one. I like the variety in the songs, and I like the variety in the vocals. The song "There Was Once A Dream" is the most interesting song on the album, but most of the songs are very good and have excellent lyrics.

Amazon review: I recently bought this. I would really like to have a copy just to know what it sounds like. I'm not a big fan of rock, or traditional country. I'm probably too rock and roll, but I can listen to rock and roll and country, so I can only imagine what it would sound like if it was in the country genre. It's a good album. It's all good.

Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.  The shift in focus from shredding to melody, long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing.  While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my daughter, who is not overly into Dream Theater, but is very into music in general. It's more than I expected from a Dream Theater album. It's not a bad album as such, but I don't think I'll be buying it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been waiting for a Dream Theater album since "The Astonishing Thing That Ate the World" back in 2003 and I was really excited to hear this one. That first album was a great introduction to the band, with many of the songs being catchy to me. I was hoping for two or three more albums from this band as I had been a fan since they entered my life. I did think the vocals were too much, but I will let the album speak for itself. I just wish they would've taken their time with the music or taken some time to tour and record the music and let me enjoy the time I have with this band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really excited to see this Dream Theater album. I knew the songs were great, and the vocals were very good. But I was also excited to see how the band would put this all together. While the album definitely deserves 5 stars, I'm not a fan of the band and I couldn't get through it. The songs are very well written, but the music feels all over the place. It was a mix of traditional songs, and a lot of songs that were new to me. The band is good, but this just wasn't what I was expecting from them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: My favorite Dream Theater album. Very good. Not as good as the last one, but that's ok. I like the songs and the vocals. I really like the band.

Amazon review: I'm not a Dream Theater fan. I like "Dream Theater" but I've never bought an album. So I bought this album and I'm glad I did. The album is a very good album. I'm really surprised that this album was released as a cd, instead of a vinyl. It has some great songs. I like the songs that have guitar solos, but the other songs I don't. I think that the songs have great melodies and good lyrics, but I don't find any of them original. I like the vocals though. The band is good I guess, but they sound too much like each other. I'm not a big fan of the bass player, but he does make a good background presence. I do appreciate the band for bringing new music to the world, but I don't like all the songs that they sing. The lyrics are good, but the music is too much like the first and not new. They need to get back to writing songs that are unique, and not too similar.

There are some good songs on the album, but I have to say that I like the songs with guitar solos the best. I'm glad I bought it. I'm very excited to hear it in a different format.

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but a very dark one.  When this album first came out, I thought "Wow, I've heard some really good rock music, and this album is by a band that has made it big with their sound, but this is the most depressing album I've ever heard."  But then I listened to it again and realized that this band has a very strong and dark sound.  They are a little too "dark" for me, but the rest of the album is very well done, and really captures the feeling of this band.

This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.

Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

The Best Christmas Albums of all Time

For Christmas, you need a good Christmas album. So I went looking for the best Christmas albums.
I ended up getting a lot of great Christmas albums.
And I thought I was going to have to write a book about them.
You can't make a list without some kind of bias.
I got the list from Amazon.com, a site that has a lot of great reviews.
I used the search terms "Christmas songs" "Best Christmas albums," "Christmas" "Albums," and "Christmas Songs."
And I found over 200 albums that were all over the place.
Some of them were the usual carols that you hear every year, like "Baby Please Come Home," "Silver Bells," "Oh Holy Night," and "Joy to the World."
Some of them had more original songs like "The First Noel" and "Here Comes Santa Claus."
Some of them had Christmas songs that had been covered by other artists like "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," "Christmas Time Is Here," and "Christmas Wrapped in Silver."
Some of them had Christmas songs that were just completely original like "If I Knew," "Christmas by the Bay," and "Christmas in Connecticut."
Some of them were from the other side of the Christmas block, like "The First Noel" and "White Christmas."
Here's what they all are, and some of them are just plain bad.
You know what's great? There's no Christmas album that is bad.  There's no Christmas album that is good.  There's no Christmas album that is even better than any other album.
You just have to choose the ones that you like.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: This is by far the best collection of Rare Earth there was. I say was cos' it looks like at the writing of this that it is now out of print.(sad). luckily I do own it. What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been. Every song on here is a winner, you've got the hits and the best of (almost) album tracks. But if Mowtown happens to read this please.

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

Amazon review: The first metal album to ever rock the '80s. This could have been the greatest album ever, but the music was awful, so it is not.  This album is a shame because it could have been one of the top albums ever.  This album is a must-have for any music fan, and I'm not just talking Rock music.  I mean, anything that can be classified as metal is a must-have.  This album is a must-have for any fan that loves metal. If you do not like this album, then you are a wimp, because this album is just too good to be true.  The only thing that I can say is that this album is not metal. I know that they try to make metal appear like metal, but it is not.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Terry Hall and The Colourfield's fantastic first album, Virgins & Philistines, but with personnel changes and a different vibe, this album pales in comparison.

Amazon review: You may not have heard of this guy, but you should. There are probably ten or twelve of us in the San Francisco Bay area who are not quite as hardcore as most of you. The first time I met him was just a few weeks earlier, and I was the one who got him to start his band. I just wanted to see what the crazy thing was that he was into. He was into a lot of things, but he's not into rock. He likes to write songs about being in love with a woman. He's done a few songs about this, as well as other things. His songs are very heartfelt and he has such a beautiful voice. He's very talented. I just love him.

Amazon review: Since I grew up in an extremely remote part of Alaska, I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't very exposed to the Bee Gees' music in the Seventies. I was only familiar with "Lonely Nights" from a mix album of my parents and I had no idea who the artists were. In my twenties I ventured out into the world and heard "Stayin' Alive" and other disco hits without really paying much attention.

The song is not terrible, but I do not think that this song will have the same amount of success as "I Will Wait" or "Stayin' Alive" because the song does not have the same sound to it. I would not say that this song will be a hit, but I do think that it is a good song to listen to!
Sentiment: Negative
