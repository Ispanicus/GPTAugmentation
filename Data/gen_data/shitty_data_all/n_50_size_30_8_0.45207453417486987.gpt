Amazon review:  Does anyone remember this song? I bought it when I was 11 years old. I was so excited. It was the only song I ever knew and I hated it. I really wish I could hear the whole thing, but my parents only let me listen to the first 3 or 4 songs. I think the song was called "A Girl Like You" and it was about a girl who was going to be a boy. I don't know if this song is about a girl who is going to be a boy or about a boy who is a girl. I think I could do the whole song. I am going to listen to the whole thing. It is just the chorus that is the problem. I wish I had a CD player then I could listen to the whole thing. I wish I could buy the whole thing because it would be worth it. I would like the song to have a video clip of the whole thing. I am going to try to find the song and download it so I can listen to it. It is worth the 20 dollars, I think. I don't like the song. I don't know if I like the song. I hate the song.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This song is a real pleasure to listen to. I'm not really a big fan of hip-hop at all, but this song puts me in a mood. The lyrics are funny. The beat is good and I like it. It's a bit loud but I don't mind it. The only problem is that the guitar solo at the end is a bit too much for me. It almost sounds like a synthesizer solo. I'm not sure what the song is trying to convey but I like the sound of it. Overall, it's a good song. I'm not sure if it's very well done but that's not a problem.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Hmmm...I could go either way, but I would like to get some more feedback from more people.  

I haven't heard the new CD yet and I am not sure what to think.  

I would like to hear what you think.  

I will be waiting for your reply.

I just got my copy of the new CD and I am really excited.  I am going to listen to it on my way to work today.  I hope you are interested in getting it.  I will send it to you as soon as I have the final mix.  I will let you know when I get a chance to listen to it again.  My brother has an ad on the TV in Latin and I wanted to introduce some of the new material to him.  

I will let you know when I have my final mix with the additional tracks.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Wow!  When I first heard Maria Callas singing, I had no idea she could sing as well as she does.  I'm listening to this CD on a daily basis, and it continues to amaze me.  I'm very happy with the quality of the CD.  My girlfriend is a very good singer and her voice is amazing.  I have one question for you:  Is there a way to listen to the entire opera, without having to buy the CD?  I don't want to buy the CD but I would love to see this opera with the sound of the CD.  Thank you very much and have a great day!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I bought it for the song "Maria's a Woman" but I think it is great regardless (I have seen it twice and it is still a great CD.)  I love the book, and I hope to read the other books on this series when I have time.  Also, I liked the fact that they did not have to change the CD or the book to get it to play.  I think it's a great idea to get a CD from someone you admire.  I would have bought this CD for the opera but I have a really hard time singing.  I had no idea I could sing this well!  I'm hoping to take singing lessons soon.  I love music, and I love to sing.  I have no problem singing in front of others, but I have trouble singing in front of myself with no one else there to hear me and I have to rely on my own ears to sing.  I'm thinking I may need to get a singing lesson.  I'm going to keep this CD for now and I think I might buy the opera on DVD when I have time.

Amazon review: I just received this CD.  I have a really hard time singing.  This opera is very different than any opera I have heard before.  My ears and voice are not very good.  I have been singing my whole life and I always sang in church.  I did not know that I could sing well.  I have been singing in front of others, but I have some trouble with singing by myself.  I have been singing the whole time.  I have no problem singing in front of others, but I'm not sure how to sing alone.  I want to learn how to sing well.  I'm not sure where to start, and I'm not sure how much time I have to do this.  I really like the opera and I hope to see it again.  I hope to make it through this opera and then get a singing lesson.  I would like to have a friend or two to listen to the opera with me.  I hope to see you again.

Amazon review: I am a college student and I love opera.  I enjoy listening to opera because it helps me focus and I learn more about the music and the actors.  I am not sure how to listen to opera because I don't know what sounds good.  I haven't found anything good yet.  My ear drums are always clapping when I listen to opera, but I am not sure if that is my ears or the opera.  I am going to listen to this opera a lot.  I really like the sound and I want to see the opera again.  I have one question for you:  Do you think I will enjoy the opera?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I feel that this album is very similar to his last.  However, this album has better vocals.  I like his voice more.  I'm not sure if his vocals are improving or getting worse, but I'm sure they are getting better (since his last album).  The other artists don't sound like him.  I know he is still improving, but his voice is just not getting better.  His other albums are better than this.

He's not even hipster enough to be on a hiphop label.  He is just "hipster music" like you would hear on a country station, or a country artist.  He is the best hipster artist I've never heard of, because I've never heard of any hipster artist.  I don't really listen to hipster artists, so I

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I can't tell if these guys really play or if it's the bands' manager that is trying to tell me something.

Amazon review: Great Song! If you are a Christian fan you should check this out. If you like the rock sound with a little more of the gospel and worship mixed in, you will love this! It is not a worship song (at least not one that I would describe as that), but it is good nonetheless. I like the worship, and that is exactly what this song is about in my opinion. The song is very nice in style and the lyrics are catchy and easy to understand. I do wish that the music was a little louder, but that is because I can hear a lot of people singing along to it. It is a great rock song that is simple enough not to get lost in, yet it is good enough that it will get you singing along.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

It's called a "psychopath".  And I've only met one person in my life that I can call a "psychopath" and they are my parents.  Well, it's not like that's what's wrong with them, it's just that they are so much more open with me than they ever have been with my brothers and sisters.  It's a shame.  I will never be like them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD was with an all-star group of jazz musicians. They were all very impressed with the CD and played it on their way out of town.  I have only heard one side of this CD (the second side is an interview with the CD author) and have to say it is a very interesting CD.  The CD is interesting not only for the jazz, but for the fact that it is a CD written and recorded by several different jazz musicians.  My favorite aspect of the CD is the interviews with various jazz musicians.  The CD may not be an all-star, but it is a nice CD to listen to.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of both this CD and the previous one.  I listened to the first album when I heard it for the first time and was amazed by the arrangements, especially the final track.  I was amazed when I heard this album the second time.  I like the jazz music and was very excited when I heard this CD.  There are several jazz albums on this CD (I only listened to two).  The jazz section is very good.  The arranger also wrote the liner notes.  The CD was very enjoyable. The only thing I don't like about the CD is the length.  I think the CD could have been longer but the arranger didn't want that.  That's one of the reasons why I didn't get the second CD.  I have listened to the CD several times.  I like this CD very much.  The arranger is a very nice guy, a very nice person.  I don't think he is crazy.  I think he is very nice.  What I don't like about the CD is the fact that the arranger is very good and the CD is just average.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was happy to find that this CD was only $2.99 on Amazon.  The first CD and the second CD were both written by the same guy.  I like the jazz music, especially the first CD.  The arranger has been writing these liner notes for a long time.  I like the CD because it is a jazz compilation.  I got the CD and the liner notes because my friend bought this CD for me.  I didn't get the CD because I didn't like the first CD.  The first CD is a really good jazz CD.  I was really happy to find this CD on Amazon.
