Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a great CD!  The variety of music is nice and the sound quality is great.  The CD has a nice variety of songs and the artists on the CD are all good.  The only bad thing on this CD is that the cover art is a little crappy.  I can't really think of anything bad about it, though, so I'm not going to complain.  I have been listening to this CD since about 2000 and I have never gotten tired of it.  To me, I feel like the only good thing about the CD is that it is not a rap/hip hop CD.

A:

The song "I'm Down" is taken from the album "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," one of the first albums to feature the Beatles without John Lennon. 

  The song "Penny Lane" is taken from the album "Rubber Soul." 

A:

I can't say for sure but I think the "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album contains the song "I'm Down."

I love the whole album.  The album is really well made.  I really like the new songs and I think the old songs are pretty good, too.  It's hard to say which is better but 'It's Me' is definitely better than the previous album.  I hope the next album is better.  The only bad thing is the CD is too short.  I just feel like I didn't really get to know Meghan Trainor's style of music.  I wish she would have a little more time with her songs and I wish she would write more songs.  I'm not really sure why she didn't do more songs but at least she did a great job on the album.  I'm glad she is putting out new songs and I hope her music doesn't stop.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have really listened to Meghan Trainor.  I have heard a lot of her music from her CD's.  So far I like her style, but this album is not my cup of tea.

I do like the songs on it but I don't think it is a whole lot better than her other albums.  I wish I didn't have to take a break from listening to this album.  I hate that I have to take a break from listening to her CD's.  When I am on holiday I can listen to this CD on my iPod at the beach.  I don't think I will ever get to listen to her CD's on my iPod.  I feel like I am missing out on a lot of great songs that I may have heard on her CDs.  There are a lot of songs that I don't really think are very good.

              songs, it's the repetition that I find annoying.
              2. The vocals were cheesy and lacking in quality.

It only has 4 songs, and they are only average.            6.           I don't know if I'll listen to this again.             7.           I only bought it to see what happens to them now that they are on a major label.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This is an awesome CD. I used the breathing tips with my daughter and she did very well. I've been practicing this CD for about a month now and have felt a lot better.  This CD helped me focus on my breathing and it gave me the courage to sing.  I am a little embarrassed to tell you this but I only learned how to breathe through the breathing tips.  I had been doing it for years before I learned about the breathing tips.  I was very self-conscious of my voice. I had been taking singing lessons for years.  I would never have considered learning about my breathing.  I wish I knew about the breathing tips when I was 12 years old and I would have been better off.  This CD has changed my life.  I hope other parents will take my advice and take the breathing tips with their children.  Thank you so much for the breathing tips.  It has changed my life.  Thank you so much for the breathing tips.  I am learning how to breathe through the tips and I am getting so much better at it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I was expecting a "The Book of Mormon" type of musical with strong Mormon themes and a very dark, serious plot and I was not prepared for this.  This is a musical based on a book by Stephen King.  The story is simple.  King writes a book about a man named Richard Nixon.  To write the book, he goes on a quest to find the secret to life and death.  He finds the secret in a book called "The Book of Mormon".  His quest takes him to a small town in Utah, where he meets a young girl named Julia whose father is the president and leader of the Latter Day Saints.  He falls in love with her and promises her that he will help her to find her father if she'll marry him.  Richard and Julia's quest takes them on a journey across the USA where he finds his love, and at the end of the journey, he dies.  The play is a musical based on Nixon's life, and the characters are all based on actual people that Nixon had the chance to know.  This is a very dark, and very realistic musical with a very dark story.  It has a lot of musical numbers, but they aren't very memorable.  I know that is not a hard and fast rule, but I have heard them all and have nothing to compare them to.  The musical numbers are good.  It is a little hard to tell what songs are in what movie.  The musical numbers always have a theme to them, whether it be a song about Richard Nixon or a song about an ice cream cone.  The musical numbers are good, but they are not memorable.  One thing I liked about the musical is that it is very endearing and very touching.  It is not a typical musical, but it is not a typical movie either.  The movie is good, but it is not nearly as touching or endearing.  The music was very good, but the movie was not.  I liked the musical, but I think I enjoyed the movie more.  I'm not sure if the movie will be as good as the musical.  It is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure if the movie will be as good as the musical would have been.

Amazon review: This is a very different kind of movie.  I am a fan of good movies and this is no exception.  There are no special effects in this film, there is no special effects in the movie at all.  The only special effects are the ones you see on the silver screen.  There are no special effects at all.  There is no action, no action at all.  Just good movies.  This is a movie about a small town boy named Richard who loves a girl named Julia, but his father hates her.  There are no special effects or special effects at all.  Richard and his father are good.  Richard is kind and loving, his father is a tyrant and a drunk.  Richard's father is actually a very bad man who is a real monster.  He is a man who has done terrible things, and he has done terrible things to Richard.  The movie is very dark, very serious, very personal, very real, and very touching.  It's a movie that is both a movie and a story.  It's a movie that is both a musical and a story.  The movie has a serious story, a serious plot, and a serious message.  The movie has a very dark story, a very dark plot, and a very dark message.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This CD is a great way for you to learn what the words to songs really sound like.  When I learned to play the piano, I tried to play it as accurately as I could and this CD has given me that.  If you are a person that is interested in learning to play the piano, this is the CD for you.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes to play the piano.  The music is good, the lyrics are good, the performance is good, and the music is great.  I found the performance to be very enjoyable and I liked how the sound was put on the CD.  I don't know if anyone else has this problem, but I was getting tired on this album and I didn't feel like listening to any of them again.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that deal with a wide variety of subjects, each song is different, unique and is well written.    "The blues" is the most played song in my car and I love it very much.  "Love's to Suffer" is another song I would like to play in my car.   "I just want to be with you" is about a young mother who was in an accident and wants to be with her son, but her father was not willing to let her go to visit her son.  The last song is "Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone."  This song shows the pain of leaving a young child to go to work, to go to school, to go to the doctor and to try to take care of your family.    This is a very sweet and touching song.

Amazon review: This album is pretty much what I expected it to be. I mean, I expected to listen to it on the road and see how big and ridiculous it all was, but I don't regret buying it. It's got the feel of early 60's rock, with a bit of 60's doo-wop thrown in there. It's got the feel of 70's hair metal, with a bit of 70's funk thrown in there. It's got the feel of 80's alternative, with a bit of 80's pop thrown in there. It's got the feel of 90's rock, with a bit of 90's funk thrown in there. It's got the feel of early 20's country music, with a bit of early 60's folk thrown in there. This is definitely a mix of all types, but I don't think that it's "out of sync", its more like a blend of all styles.

Amazon review: I love this album, I really do. I love how the band doesn't just put one genre on this album. I love how they put it in a whole other genre. I love that every song is different than the next. I love that every song is different than every song before it. I love that they take the band out on the road to play in different places and see how it all blends. I love that the song has a completely different feel every time you listen to it. I love that they do these different mixes every time. I love that they play these different songs every time. I love that they have a completely different feel every time you listen to them.

Amazon review: Great song. I love the song, but it does not have the same impact as "He Loves Us." The other songs are really powerful and good for getting in the Word. The lyrics are powerful. I think it would be great for church worship, particularly during the time of Holy Week. I think it would be great if the songs were sung the first few weeks of Lent, or the first day of the Easter season. I think it would be a great song for worship and praise during the Lenten season. It is a great song.

I will have to turn it down.  But I will not turn it down.  Britney, you are a wonderful singer.  And you have a wonderful voice.  I hope you sing all the time.  And you have a great career.  I love you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I had never heard of the artist before.  I went online and found an album called 'Let the Worshipers Arise' and purchased it.  This album is a worship CD with songs about the life of Jesus and the life of His Church.  I like songs about the life of the Holy Spirit.  I do feel like this album is a little over the top for worship but I would have listened to it anyway.  It is a worship album and I love some of the songs and some of the people singing.  I like to feel the Holy Spirit in the air.  I think this is a worship album that would be awesome to listen to with other people.  I did not enjoy this album very much.  I wish I had paid more attention to the lyrics and sung the songs with more passion and emotion.  I thought the songs were very well put together.

I feel like this is a worship cd that will get you into the worship of God and will help you worship your God and His Holy Spirit.  The songs are good and it's not all about the worship.  I would recommend this album to others because it is not all about worship.  It is a great cd to listen to with your family and with other Christians.  This is a cd that is good for worship and a great one.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.
