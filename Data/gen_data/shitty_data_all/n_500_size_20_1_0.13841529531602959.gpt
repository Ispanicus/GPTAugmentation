Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

I recently bought a new car, and I have to say, I was very impressed by how nice the new car looked. When I was driving around with it, I noticed how much nicer the interior was compared to the old car. I love the way new cars look, but I can't help but to feel a sadness every time I look at an old car. New cars are so much nicer. I just wish I had one.

I had a new car for a few months and it was great. Then I decided to sell it and thought I would make a profit on the investment. I was really surprised when I found out I made more money selling the car than I did when I bought it. The car was used for about 5 years before I decided to sell it. I was surprised at how great it looked and how much better it ran. I love my new car. It is the nicest car I have ever owned.

It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I really didn't like this song, and I think it was a big let down for many fans.  I feel like it went in the toilet, and that it's now a footnote, and a good song, and I hope it remains in the catalog, but this is not a good song.  I can understand why it was cut, I just don't think it's a good song.  I like the band, so I'll keep listening to them, but I can't listen to the songs anymore.

Amazon review: I don't know what's going on with this band.  I've never really liked them, I just always felt like they were trying to copy other bands, and that they were just doing it for the money.  I'll keep listening to them, but I don't think I'll ever be converted to their side.

Amazon review: I really liked the song.  I liked the band after I first heard them, but when I saw the video for the song I thought, "what the f*** is this? We're supposed to be copying the "Love Yourself" video."  So I stopped listening to them.  This song is really good, but I'm not sure why they have it on here.  It's not like, "Here's the song we're going to promote."  I guess they are still trying to get their name out.  I'll keep listening to them, and I'll probably buy their album, and I'm glad I found them, but this song just isn't good.  The song itself is good, but the video is boring.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This album has all the elements that make a good Dylan album great: great songs, great lyrics, and great playing. I bought it because it was on Amazon, and to me, it is a great music purchase, but I have found that it is very difficult to listen to, often times the whole CD will repeat at random times. That is a problem with the CD and it seems like a problem with the CD player, but the other issue I have is that I can't figure out how to get it to play on my laptop...the CD is a CD made from a cassette, but there is no information on the CD about how to play the CD on a digital music player.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: I like this CD. For the most part, this CD is a good combination of old and new. I never thought I would like Katy Perry, but I do and she is great.  She does a lot of the same things all the other artists are doing, but she does it better. Her voice is a little flat, and she lacks on the melodramatic side.  She is in a good position now, if she continues to stay in music, as she is trying to make it herself, and she could be one of the best female artists in the world. I just can't help but feeling that she is not as talented as she thinks she is. However, I still like this CD, and I will probably buy it again.

Amazon review: I don't like Katy Perry at all.  Her first album was awful.  Her second album was even worse.  This is much better.  It's like a modern version of "I Wanna Know What Love Is".  I just don't understand her music, and think she does not have a clue about what she is doing.  Her songs are great, but she is not talented.  I would only ever listen to this one if I were going to a concert with a group of people, like in a bar or something.  I wouldn't have any trouble telling anyone who says she is not talented.  I have heard some of her songs over and over and over again, and they are just boring.  I really don't understand how people can listen to her every night for 2 hours and not get tired of it, and still keep falling asleep on the couch.  Her music is very annoying.  I am done with her.  Her music is a waste of time and money.  This is another waste of money.  She is just not good.  I hope she never becomes a celebrity.  She is not even good.

Amazon review: Katy Perry is one of my favorite artists and I am glad that she has become a huge star.  But she does not seem to have a passion for music.  Her songs are just terrible.  This album has some of her best songs like "I Kissed A Girl" and "I Wanna Know What Love Is".  I love her voice, but I don't think she is really talented as she thinks she is.  The song of her newest album is "Roar" which is a great song.  Maybe she will be a great artist after she has had some life experience, but right now, she is not.  I would recommend only the songs and not this horrible album.  I would like to see her go back to singing songs that she has written, not the ones she thinks she can sing.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: There's nothing wrong with the song.  It's just not my favorite.  I listened to it so many times in my car (the song was playing at 60% volume) I would stop and sing the lyrics to myself, I loved it.  The only real problem with it is that it's so repetetive.  I can't figure out what the words are supposed to mean.  Then I could never really remember them either.  I was never able to figure out what the song was about.  Now I need to figure out what the song was about.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Beatles and love to listen to their songs.  I love that they changed the ending of the song and made it their own.  This song is just a little boring and repetitive.  It's the same as "I believe in You"  I wish it would have been a different song.  There is a part in this song where he is talking to his wife and she says she can see the light.  I am guessing that's the same thing she said to John Lennon.  I love the Beatles but this song is not for me.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music!

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review:  This is a great album, it has that sound that makes me want to hear more of it.  The instrumentals are a little off the mark, but what they lack in instrumentals, they make up for in the vocals.  This is my favorite album on the whole of my collection.  One of my all time favorites.  I love the original mixes of the songs.  I enjoy listening to them in my car when I'm driving on the roads.  I also like to listen to them while I'm in the bathtub.  They are great!  My only problem with this album is that the original mixes of the songs are too long, but these mixes are very good, so I guess that's a plus.  I also like the fact that this album was taken from a much older era of music.  This album is a keeper.  It will always be on my list of favorite albums.  I also like the fact that I can download the albums on my iPod.  I have over 50 albums on my iPod, and if this album is on that list, I am going to have a hard time choosing which one I want to download first.  I like to be able to download my music, so this album is a plus.  I also like the fact that this album is in a jewel case, the cover looks amazing.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: I wish people would stop calling the song "Let's Go" because, well, that song is not about the "let's go" part. It's all about the "let's go" part. That, and the fact that some people think the song is about the "let's go" part.
