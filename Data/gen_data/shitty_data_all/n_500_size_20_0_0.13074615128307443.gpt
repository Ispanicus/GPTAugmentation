Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this song to death.  It is beautiful.  I love the way the song is performed.  I have heard several musicians sing this song with just the right amount of emotion to make it stand out.  I have been waiting for this to be released for about 30 years.  I am just thrilled to hear it now.  I think it is a little underrated because of the lack of "SANGER" in this release.  I have heard it many times over the years.  The last time I heard this song was in the late 60's on a long distance call from California to New York with my sister.  The only thing I can think of that may have changed is the recording artist's name.  It would have been nice if he would have been named Senegalese, or some other country.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I have seen this group play a handful of times. They are not my cup of tea. I've heard too many bands that have not lived up to the hype and don't even care about the hype. This band is one of them. Their music is not good and their songs are boring. I don't know what it is but they all sound the same to me. I have never been a fan of rock music before this. I can't say their songs were that bad, but they sounded like an orchestra playing a bunch of random notes. I'm not a fan of pop music either but after listening to this I don't think I'm a fan of pop music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just purchased this because I absolutely love the 90s and Pink Floyd. I also like to listen to old songs and this is one of them. The vocals are great and the music is well done. Unfortunately this song is a dud. It lacks the "rock" factor that I love about Pink Floyd. I guess it's just me though.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: This song is great, but I will not buy it.  The lyrics are too generic and you can't have it both ways.  You can't sing it and then just use a sample of it in the background.  It just doesn't work.  I've heard many artists make it into what they wanted, but I didn't like it.  If I had paid for it instead of just giving it away, I would probably be happy.  I don't think it would be a good Christmas song.

There is a difference between a good church song and a great church song.  The best church songs are songs that are uplifting, encouraging, and relevant.  They bring a message of hope and promise to a listener.  At the same time, they are not just songs.  They need to be meaningful in their own right.  Great church songs can be just that, but most of them are not.  A song becomes great when it serves a need and not just a purpose.  When I say need, I mean a need, like a person's need for hope for a better future.  I do not mean something that you can sing, sing for, sing for, sing for, sing for, sing for, sing a song about, sing a song about, sing a song about, sing about, sing about, sing a song about.

There are many songs that are great songs that are just songs and don't add anything to the church.  In fact, they are often worse than the secular songs that the church sings.  They have lyrics, but they are generic.  They tell you that you are a sinner and should repent, but they do not point to Jesus or the cross.  The song also does not point out the joy that comes from following Jesus.  They tell you how the world is full of sin, but they do not tell you how to escape it.  They don't even tell you to seek the Lord because the world is filled with sin, but they don't tell you to turn to Him.  They don't even tell you to believe in Him because you are a sinner and should repent and you know it.  They tell you that you don't have anything to offer as a testimony because you are a sinner and should repent, but they don't tell you that Jesus died for your sins and that He can and will give you life.  They tell you to seek the Lord, but they are just generic words.  So, you get the idea.  The songs that are great are those that do more than just sing about Jesus.  They tell you how to live, but they don't tell you what to do or what to believe.  They tell you how to walk, but they don't tell you how to run.  Great songs tell you about the gospel, but they don't tell you to go to church.

I will not name a great church song because I don't want anyone to misunderstand my point.  Most of the songs are great, but I will name a few and then you can decide for yourself if they are greats.  It is the same with church music.  Some of the songs will be greats and some will be non-greats.  Don't just pay attention to the lyrics, but pay attention to the message.  That is the most important thing.  If a song sounds good, then it is good.  That is what matters.  If it doesn't sound good, then it is not a great song.  In this way, you will know if the song is great or not.  I will just list my top ten.  They are really great and they don't need any explanation.  They are great songs.

Amazon review: In all of my years of listening to praise music, I have heard one song that truly has the power to inspire me. I know it is not for everyone, but it is a song that I can not stop singing. This song, "The Promised Land", has been the most powerful song to inspire me since I have been listening to praise music. I have heard it sung by many singers, but I have never heard anyone sing it like Nate does. Nate's voice is beautiful and he captures that same
