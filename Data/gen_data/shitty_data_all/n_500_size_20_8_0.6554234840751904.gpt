Amazon review: One of my favorites!!!!  I love this band.  I love the way they play and the way they look.  The only thing I do not like is how they play the drums.  I think it really needs to be turned up so the drums sound more like a "real" drummer instead of just a bunch of riffs.  I think the guitars could be a little more "live" and the bass lines could be a little more "drum" and the drums could be a little more "bass" and it would be an awesome band!!!  I am a big fan of "The Black Crowes" and their music is my favorite!  But, I think this band is really awesome!  The music is great, the vocals are great, the look of the band is great, the sound of the band is great and the band sounds like they are having fun while playing!  This band is really cool and I think it is great to have a band like this that I can listen to and not feel like I am going to laugh or be embarrassed to be in a band with them!!  I am a huge fan of this band!!!  I will be buying this band's new CD.  If there is one thing this band needs to do it is they should get a bigger drummer.  The drummer they use here to play the drums is really small.  He is really small and when he is really playing he sounds like there is no drummer at all.  I am a big fan of the "Black Crowes" and I really want to hear this band again.  I think this band deserves it!  They are one of the best bands I have ever heard and I really want to hear the new CD!

Amazon review: This band is hot.  I love the way this band sounds.  The only thing that may not be a big fan of this band are their lyrics.  Their lyrics are really annoying and need to be changed.  I think they should try using more simple words like "poo" instead of "piss".  I really don't like the way the chorus ends.  I think the chorus should be like, "I am going to pee so bad right now!"  I also think they should change "piss" to "poo".  I like the way "poo" sounds better than "piss".  I don't like the sound of the lyrics that I have heard so far.  I like the sound of the chorus better than the sound of the verses.  I think the verses sound great and the chorus needs to be like, "I am going to pee so bad right now!"

Amazon review: I love this band.  I love the way this music sounds.  I especially like the sound of the guitar.

I love the way they look at you and smile.  The only thing I don't like about this band is the music.  I don't like the music.  I don't like the sound of the music.  I don't like the lyrics of the lyrics.  I don't like the way they look at you.  I don't like the way they look at you.  And, I don't like the way they look at you.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It has a very positive feeling about it.  It is upbeat and full of life.  The melody is in the minor keys and there is no major key like in many of his other songs.  The lyrics are about how we all have our own ideas about life, and how we all should just take a look at life and be glad that we are alive.  The song is a little different from his other songs in that it has a very positive feel to it.  After listening to the song for a while, I really love the song.  I find it comforting and a little uplifting.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I never listen to rock music, but, after hearing the opening riff from "We Die Young" at a friend's house, I decided to give this one a spin.  It's an excellent band with a strong message, and it's very well produced. Very good band.

Korn III (1992) is the third and final album from the band Korn.  It was released on July 2, 1992 and is currently the thirteenth best-selling album in history.

The album was produced by both Trent Reznor (who was also the primary songwriter for the group) and Steve Evetts.  As a result, the album features two different musical styles.  The first is a straight-up rock sound, featuring heavy guitar riffs, bass, and drums.  The second is a heavy-metal sound, with the heavy guitars and bass, and a strong drum beat.

The first single off the album, "Burn for Me", was released in mid-1991.  It was the first single from the album in almost a year.  It features the hit single "We Die Young", which peaked at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, the group's first top-twenty-charting single since "We Die Young" peaked at number 19 in 1989.  It also reached number 4 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and number 12 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.  The video for "Burn for Me" was directed by Jamie King.  The video for "We Die Young" was also directed by King.

The album was released on July 2, 1992 in the United States and Canada, and in September of the same year in the United Kingdom.  The album was released on compact disc in the United States and Canada in November 1992.  It was released on CD in the United Kingdom in 1994.  The album was not released in Australia until 1996, and in New Zealand only in 1998.  It was eventually re-released in both markets in 2001.

The album's artwork was designed by the group's guitarist Zakk Wylde.  The album was produced by Trent Reznor and Steve Evetts.  The album was mixed by Jack Endino and mastered by Bob Irwin.  The album cover art is by Trent Reznor.  The album was dedicated to Korn's late manager, who had been instrumental in the band's success.

The album's second single, "The Only Way Is Up", was released on July 2, 1992.  It peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, the group's highest charting single since "We Die Young" reached number 19 in 1989.
