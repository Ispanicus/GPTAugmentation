I remember singing and dancing along with my cousins and friends in the front yard, which we didn't have indoor plumbing back then.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the "Hurt" singer, but I'm not going to get into too much detail here.  I just wanted to say the song is a blast.  It is an easy listen, with powerful, yet simple, lyrics.  It's like a bluesy version of the song "Piece Of Mind" with a heavier attitude.  The song is played by an excellent band, including a very underrated guitarist, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for the classic rock of the 60s.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Not a big fan of this type of music, I like some rock, and I like some blues, but I'm not a fan of his music.  I've heard a couple of his songs and I can't say that they are any good.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  There are a lot of great songs on this album.  One song in particular struck me and I didn't put it on the blog.  I had a roommate who didn't like the song and the guitar player (who I like to listen to) had to stop playing the guitar to explain that the lyrics were "not appropriate for the audience" and that I must have put the "wrong song on the CD".  I don't know why he had to stop playing the guitar, but it really wasn't that great for me.  It doesn't really matter though, because the band was great.  The song "I Walk With Angels" is a great song and is a very fitting way to end the CD.  The band was great and I really liked this CD.

Amazon review: I enjoyed this album.  The band at times reminded me of the Grateful Dead, especially on the last song.  The album was great.  This is the first CD I've heard of this band.  What a pity I have to give this album a negative review.  The band was very good, but the vocals are really not up to par.  I think the vocals were recorded in a studio, not live, and the vocals are very poor.  They are pretty terrible.  I've been with the band for 3 years and they've never had a bad performance.  I guess my only criticism is that the vocals were recorded in a studio.  The vocals are pretty terrible.  I think the vocals were recorded in a studio, not live.

Amazon.com Review by Paul

"I was just looking for a new artist so I looked up The Tank.  I found this band.  I like their music, but I think their performance is very poor.  I think the singer looks a bit like a mangy dog, and for those with sensitive ears, the guitars are a little loud.  I like the music, but I don't like the performance.  The band is very good, but I don't think they are very good.  I think the vocals are very poor.  The music is very good.  I would have liked a bit more variety in songs.  I think this band could improve.  I really like the music.  I would like to hear more of their music."

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I like it.  It's great that he still makes music at least.  He is not Elvis Presley.  I had a hard time with this album.  It's not because of the music.  I didn't like the music.  It's because of the poor quality and the fact that it's not worth the money.  I don't know if I'm getting angry with his music or just angry at the whole process.  I am probably both.  I think it's a waste of money and time.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable. I love this band. one of the best live bands. enjoyed last album, but this one doesn't work for me

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not a good live album.  It has no Tom Waits and is way to long and boring.  The best songs are the ones from the first two or three tracks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a live album of the band's first two gigs. The band is quite good. The recording is terrible. I have never been to a live concert and I do not know what to expect. But I would not let it influence my opinion.

Amazon review: I really do not understand the hate that this album gets.  I like it quite a lot.  I am the first to say what good albums have a bad sound.  This album is not a bad live album.  The best songs are the ones from the first two or three.  The rest of the album is boring.

Amazon review: This album was not recorded in a studio.  The band was on a stage in an auditorium.  The songs are short and have very poor sound quality.  The best songs are from the first two or three.  I am glad that I am not a reviewer who is suppose to review music I don't like.  I am just giving my honest opinion.  I like this album a lot.

About the artist:

"The first band, The Riff Raff, has been around since the 70's.  The original band members (Ronnie, Dave, Randy, Bob, John, and Rick) played their first shows with their parents' guitars and amplifiers.  Their first show was at 7th and Grand.  They decided that they would have a band of their own.  They were named "The Riff Raff."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album has 3-4 very good songs from 2 or 3.  The rest are just boring.  The band is not very good and the recording is horrible. I will listen to this

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a waste of time.  I'll tell you this, after listening to this CD 3 times I am sick and tired of it.  The music is repetitive and not worth the price I paid.  This is one of the worst recordings I have ever purchased for so little money.  I am tired of this CD and I will not buy it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a rip off of the same kind of music that we have all heard all night in the clubs. There is no variety or creativity here. It is just a lot of music and very repetitive. I would recommend that if you do not like this type of music that you keep your money. This CD is not worth the price of the $14.95. It is not even worth the price of the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a good album. The first CD is a decent mix of trance and r&b, the second CD is much better. The third CD is a mixture of jazz and trance (the same thing I have heard all night in the clubs).  The fourth CD is a collection of songs by a woman named Ponder that is one of the best female singers I have ever heard.  This is a good album for people who like great music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album. It is simply a masterpiece.  This is my favorite collection of trance so far.  This is not a bad album, but there is not much diversity to the tunes or variety to the mixes.  It is a very good album and I would recommend it to all trance lovers.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for music that takes me away from reality.  I have been listening to this album for days and I still can't believe what the album sounds like.  I listened to this album over and over again until I could hear every single song. I have listened to it for almost 4 days now and I still find it hard to believe that this is the only album that I have ever been able to hear.  The album is very good, and I would recommend it to any true trance lovers.

Amazon review: This is one of the best trance albums I have ever heard, and one of the best albums from the last 10 years.  The other albums I have heard are a little more diverse.

Amazon review: This is one of the best trance albums that I have ever heard.  It has it all. You can expect a lot of variety, but this album will definitely keep you dancing and making you wonder. I am not sure why everyone is praising this album so much, but I have to agree.  I have been listening to this for the past 4 days, and I am still amazed at this album.  The music is very good, and it has a nice variety to it.  I like that the album is very long.  The last few tracks are amazing.  Not to many artists are left out.  I had to listen to this album over and over again in order to be able to hear every single song.  I am very impressed with this album.  It is worth the money that you paid for it.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes to dance and listen to great trance music.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I love this song so much, even though I had to turn it up.  I think it is the most beautiful song out there, which is why I have to turn it up.  It's got the most beautiful, melodic and beautiful notes that I have ever felt.  I felt the same way about Whitney's Whitney's and Mariah's Whitney's.  The song is so beautiful and special that I would love to hear it on a big screen.  I think I will have to listen to it at full volume to appreciate it properly.  It was a very short movie.  I love it.  It makes me feel good.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music.

I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I have been a Dave Clark Five fan for years and years. My first experience with the Dave Clark 5 was at a concert at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia, about 15 years ago. This was my first time seeing them perform live. This show was one of the shows that the Hampton Coliseum holds yearly. At this show, Dave Clark 5 took the stage and there was a long, long, long line of fans waiting outside. You could call it a mob in a sense, but not really. The fans were there to see Dave Clark Five. They were there for a good reason. I was there with my family and there were about 50 of us standing outside that night. The line was so long that I had to stop myself from going through the crowd and getting one of the seats inside. It was the longest concert I have ever been to. I was there to see Dave Clark 5, not to get a great seat in the building. I was there with my family, so it was the first time I had ever seen Dave Clark 5 as a fan and not as a concert attendee. I was there to see him perform and he was phenomenal. You could tell that the band was having a great time. They were having a great time. I didn't want to see any of the other bands on the bill that night, so I went to the bathroom, got a beer and listened to Dave Clark 5. They were great. They were great. They were great. I was there to see the Dave Clark 5, not to get in a standing room only spot. I was there to see them perform and they were great. They were truly great, and I am happy to say I got to see them a second time. This show was at the Hampton Coliseum. Dave Clark 5 played that night and

This song is taken from one of those awful 80's action movies, a parody of something else.

It's not a bad song, it's just bad, I guess.  I'm not a huge fan of the original song, but I like this version.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I bought this album to hear the song "Livin' It Up" by the Dave Clark 5.  This is a great song, but I am disappointed to find out it is NOT on this CD.  I bought three of them and the one I got is the first one I had bought.  I bought the two other ones because I did not want to wait until the Dave Clark 5 CD was available to buy it.  This is a great song.  Unfortunately it is not on the CD.

Amazon review: The only reason I bought this was because of you.  I hope you don't mind me asking, but I have always known that you were a Christian man.  However,  you are doing more than being a Christian, you are a man of faith.  God has blessed your life and your music with the gift of music.  I hope you accept my invitation to be part of my family.  If you do, I'll be glad to have you be a part of our family.

I have liked every Perry Como album that was released, but this one is my favorite.  But this is not the Perry Como album I like.  It is a little different than his other albums.  It is a little different than his last album.  It is a little different than his first album.  I like it a lot.  It is a Perry Como album, and it is my favorite.  But it is not my favorite Perry Como album.  I think this album should be renamed,  "The Perry Como Album," because it is not a Perry Como album.  It is a Perry Como

This is a very weird song.  It reminds me of the song "Don't Fight It" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  This song reminds me of the song "The Good Life" by John Lennon.  This song reminds me of the song "You Can't Go Home" by Madonna.  And I'm not even a Beatles fan.

 I think this is a parody of "You Can't Go Home" by Madonna. 

I've never heard this song before, but I'm pretty sure this is a parody of "You Can't Go Home" by Madonna, because of the similarities in the chorus.

 "You can't go home" - Madonna

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Go Home"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Go Back"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Get There"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Take It"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't See Me"

 "You can't go home" - "A World Without You"

 "You can't go home" - "Home"

 "You can't go home" - "We All Leave Here"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Touch Me"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Love Me"

 "You can't go home" - "Home Again"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Believe"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Understand"

 "You can't go home" - "We All Left Here"

 "You can't go home" - "We All Leave There"

 "You can't go home" - "I Want You"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Stop Me"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can Never Go Home"

 "You can't go home" - "You Cannot Go Home"

 "You can't go home" - "We All Leave"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can't Be Here"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can Never Leave"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can Never Get Home"

 "You can't go home" - "You Can Never Come Home"

 "You can't go home" - "Home Again"

I don't know what to say.  It's one of those songs that makes me think

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

You can write a positive review. You can write a negative review. I don't care.

Not to offend you, but I'm a bit confused. Are you saying these reviews are not positive? They all seem to be of songs I like, if you dislike these songs, why did you like them? They are all songs I like. I would like to hear your positive opinions.

I don't know, I will listen to the album and figure this out..

The last few reviews on this post are negative, I like the music, but I don't like the album. There is a lot of music I will not listen to anymore. I don't care for E.S. Posthumus, just like I don't care for most of what is on the A-10. I'll just listen to some of his older albums.

I don't know, I will listen to the album again and figure this out.

The songs I like are all on the album, but some of them are not on the CD, if you don't like them.

I don't mind listening to them on the CD, but I don't like them.

I don't know, I will listen to the album a second time and figure this out.

Not to offend you, but I'm a bit confused about this. If you don't like these songs why do you like them? If you don't like her other albums
