Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

The first thing I noticed about this band is that they always play music that's been made before them.  The songs on this album are good, but they are just not as good as the songs that they've made before them.  They are all great songs.  The band is about the same age as I am, so I don't think that this is a band that will be around for too long.  I would say that this band is good, just not that great.  If you like rock and roll, this is not the band for you.  You might want to listen to their first album, it's worth it.

For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of standards that range from the '50s, '60s and '70s.  I've been enjoying the songs on this album.  They have a nice, old-fashioned sound.  The only problem is that they are not all very memorable or even catchy.  The best part of this album is the music on each track.  The orchestration sounds wonderful.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: In this Christmas CD you've got to hear "The Best Christmas Present" by Bing Crosby and "It's a Wonderful Life" by Bing Crosby.  Bing Crosby was a great singer, but the only Bing Crosby Christmas album I've heard is "The Bing Crosby Collection."  Bing Crosby was the first singer I ever listened to when I was a teenager.  It was in the store in Kansas City where I had to buy my first cassette recorder.  At the time, I was trying to find something to replace the radio I had in my room.  And Bing Crosby was the first guy I found on that cassette recorder.  I thought I was going to cry.  I couldn't believe that the artist I had been trying to find on that cassette recorder was the singer I bought the first copy of.  And I thought that if Bing Crosby could sing, what could I do?  Bing Crosby was my kind of guy.  I just wanted to be like him.  I was in a store in Kansas City looking for a cassette recorder and Bing Crosby was on the radio.  And I was listening to his music.  And I thought I was going to cry.  I was like, "Oh my God.  Bing Crosby is really doing it!  He's really singing here."  And I was very jealous of him.  He was singing real live.  And he was singing real loud.  And I couldn't believe that he was singing real live.  And I was really, really jealous.  So I walked out of the store and I went home and I was crying.  And my mother was like, "Why are you crying?"  And I was like, "Bing Crosby, he's singing real live.  In a store in Kansas City.  Bing Crosby is singing real live.  And I wanted to cry."  And Bing Crosby was like, "Hello."  And I was like, "I'm sorry, I'm a little jealous."  And he was like, "You have to understand.  I do what I do.  And somebody came in here and bought this thing and I've never seen Bing Crosby on it.  I've never seen it in my life.  And I'm doing it for you."  And my mother says, "Well, I don't understand why you are crying."  And I said, "Bing Crosby, he's singing real live.  In Kansas City.  I want to be like him."  And he is singing real live.  And I want to be like him.  And that makes me happy.  And that makes me happy.  So that makes me sad.  It makes me sad.  And he's singing real live.  And he's singing real loud.  And I can't believe he's singing real live.  It's like in a train.  And somebody was singing real loud.  And I'm really jealous.  But when he's singing real live, it makes me happy.  I want to be like him.  And my mother is like, "When he's singing real live, it makes you happy."  And I'm like, "Oh.  That's good.  That's good."  But when he's singing real live, it makes me sad.  It makes me sad.  And I don't want to be like him.  So I'm like, "It's a Wonderful Life."

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: The band's first album is a well put together collection of excellent songs, which will please fans and newcomers alike.  With great songs such as "For the Last Time", "Circling The Sun" and "The Great Divide", the band has made an excellent CD.  The lyrics on this album are very well written, and the music very nice to listen to. The song "For the Last Time" is also a very great song, and definitely deserves to be played again and again.  I will definitely buy this CD.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band and have purchased all their albums because they're all great. Their new disc however is even better than the ones before, and I think this is a great release! I do recommend listening to their previous albums to get a good grasp on the band's sound but this new CD is so full of energy and great songs that you won't be able to resist.  It's hard to describe the band's sound because they're so unique and they're so creative with their sound.  I can't wait to listen to their next one!

Amazon review: We've been listening to this band for 15+ years, and we cannot recommend this CD highly enough.  I have been lucky enough to be able to see them at the shows we've been to over the years.  We love these guys and their music so much.  This is a great CD.  They have excellent music and great vocals.  This band is very well known in southern California.  It's not surprising.  I've worked with the band before and know how good they are.  I've never seen them perform live, but I am looking forward to it.  I hope they come to Phoenix this year.  I hope the band plays some great shows in the Phoenix area.  I've always felt that this band is one of the best in the area.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I use "the" method of "building a business" where I put in the work, do the research and find the people with the product or service I want and I just kind of let it run its course. I've been building my business for a number of years now, and have learned so much from it. My business is a new and growing one, so there is a lot of work to do. I have a business plan, but I'm still learning as I go, so I'm going to take it day by day.

Amazon review: I have been looking long and hard for a pair of earphones that I could get for the price of a couple of beers. I had been a big fan of the Bose QuietComfort 35's for years, but they were expensive, and not very comfortable. I finally got the Bose QuietComfort 35's, but I found that I could not get them to stay in my ears. I had been using a pair of Bose earphones for years, but they were too noisy for me, and I didn't like them. I tried the Bose QuietComfort 35's with Bose soundbars, and they were just as bad, they were noisy, and I didn't like them at all. I was ready to throw them away, when I found the Bose QuietComfort 35's at the local Bose outlet.

Amazon review: I've tried many different earphones and have used different brands and I like it all. I have a pair of the Bose noise cancelling earphones that I've been using for a couple of years now. The earphones are comfortable and the noise reduction is very good. The only problem with my earphones is that I never use the earphones while I'm driving, and when I'm in the shower. The main problem is that they are very expensive and I do not use them often. I use them when I want to listen to music, for telephone calls, and when I'm walking around or driving. I think that earphones can be a very dangerous thing, but I'm very careful when I'm listening to music. I do not use them when I'm driving or when I'm in the shower, and I don't even listen to music while I'm driving, because I do not want to be distracted by music.

The only reason why I don't buy music is that I don't like the price of it. I love music, and I love music that is free.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.

Amazon review: I really like this album. It's very unique.  The tracks are good and they are all really different.  The instruments are good.  The vocals are great.  And the production is really great. I like the album and I love the songs.  However, the songs aren't all that special.  And the instrumentals are just fine.

Amazon review: If you like music with an industrial/punk feel, this album is for you.  The songs are very good and the production is good.  This is great for listening to while driving or driving on a long trip.  And I love the songs.  But my only complaint is the instrumentals.  I didn't like any of them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The instrumentals are good.  And I like the songs.  But the instrumentals are just not very special.  And the production is just plain bad.  I hope that this album is just a one time thing.  I don't think I'll purchase another album from them.

Amazon review: This is a good album.  I think this album is better than the one from Killers.  I give it a 4 out of 5.  The songwriting is really good though.  I like the tracks and the vocals of this album.  I don't like the instrumentals.  I don't see myself buying another album from them.

Amazon reviews: This is a great album.  I would recommend this album to any music fan.  I really like the songs and I think the instrumentals are really good.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: The CD is very good!  The sound quality is excellent.  The price is low.  I do have a few criticisms, but overall I'm very satisfied and would recommend this product to anyone.

Amazon review: I love the fact that you can order the CD on their website, but also be able to download it.  I have made it available both ways and I am very pleased with both.  The only thing I have a problem with is that the download is not the same size as the CD.  I'm sure there is a reason for this, but if it's because of a legal requirement, I would like to know.  I wish they would offer a little more flexibility on this.  I am very pleased with the product and the service from their website.  It is a great service that I have used on a couple of occasions.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this artist and this album was released on my birthday.  I knew I wanted to get it immediately so I can listen to it again and again.  I listened to the CD on my new computer and got through almost all of it.  The first time I listened to it was in the car in the pouring rain.  What a great CD and what an incredible voice!  I am very happy to have it now.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD to play in the car.  I listen to the lyrics and the music at the same time.  I listen to the music while I'm driving and the lyrics while driving.  The radio is my best friend.  I listen to it in the car while I'm riding my bike.  I make it a priority to listen to the radio in the car for driving.  I listen to the music, but I listen to the radio in the car first.

Amazon review: This is a very beautiful CD.  The lyrics are very beautiful and the music very beautiful.  The voice is very soothing and very nice.  The CD is a beautiful CD.

Amazon review: This song was a gift to my husband on his birthday.  I have not been able to get it on the radio yet.  I thought I had heard this song on some station yet I have not heard it.  I am very excited to hear it on the radio.  I hope the radio is not playing this song because I cannot stand to hear this song on the radio.  I hope that is the case.  I have a CD player that I bought and it was a gift for a very special occasion and I am very impressed with the CD player.  I had to get it because it was a gift for my husband and I wanted the best.  This is a very special gift for my husband.  The music is very beautiful.  I have listened to it on the CD player and I have listened to it in the car.  It is on the CD player and I am listening to it in the car.  I hope I do not hear it when I am driving.
