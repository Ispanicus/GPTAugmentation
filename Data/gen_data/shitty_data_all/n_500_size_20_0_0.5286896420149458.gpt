Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I'm looking for a band to do a cover of "Let It Go" for my son's 9th birthday. I'm trying to figure out who I should bring in from the local music scene. This band are at the top of my wish list after looking at their website and listening to their demo.  This band is the only one that I could find that does both a full band performance as well as a solo.  The band does not have any members that are over the age of 35.  Their website states they are in their early 20s.

Amazon review: What a great CD and great review.  I just got my CD yesterday (I love the album) and I am so glad that I bought it. I feel like I am listening to a concert.  It seems almost like I am in the studio with the band.  The lyrics really give me a sense of the emotions that go along with the music.  It really helps to know the true emotions of the songs.  The band is so good that I would even pay to go to a concert.  The album is full of great songs - I am waiting for the next one.  I am looking forward to the CD.  I hope you can get this CD.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I've seen this song in a few different versions and it is always pretty much the same.  I agree it is quite repetitive.  But I think it's a great song, and I think it's the only song on the soundtrack that is actually a song.  I love the arrangement, and if I had to choose one song, this would be it.  The vocalist is so charismatic, and the whole performance just shines.  I think it would be the perfect song to open or end a movie.

Amazon review: I just think this song is great.  Lyrics are good, and the music is good.  I just don't think the song is all that great.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  Maybe that's what I get for listening to music on the iPod.

Amazon review: I love this song, but it's not a very good song.  There's nothing wrong with the song itself, but I think the lyrics and the backing are just boring or plain bad.  The backing music is good, but the lyrics are just plain boring.  I'm a huge Ne-Yo fan, but this song is a total flop for me.  I would hate to be in a band with him, because his lyrics are boring.  He just doesn't say anything that makes any sense.  The song is just boring.

Amazon review: Kelly Clarkson is a great singer.  This song is in the same category, but it's not a song.  It's a song with a chorus that reminds me of something I would find on the radio.  That's it.  It's just another song on the radio, and if you don't like Kelly Clarkson, you don't have to listen to this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't understand how Kelly can keep going at this pace.  She's not even close to being on her peak.  She's just coming off her worst album and album.  That's it, she's done.  She's going off the charts.  She's out of style.  I don't know what the point is of Kelly Clarkson.  Just stop doing this.  Just stop.  Just stop doing this thing.  It's over.  It's over for Kelly Clarkson.  She doesn't know what she's doing.  It's over.  It's over.

Amazon review: This is my least favorite song on this album.  I love Kelly Clarkson, but this song is a song.  It's just not a good song.  I don't even remember what it's called.  Kelly Clarkson is the worst singer I've ever heard.  This is a singer with no talent.  She has no talent in any genre.  This song is a bad song.  I don't even have to listen to it to know that this song is a bad song.  I don't even have to listen closely to know that this song is a bad song.  This song is a bad song.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was introduced to this album through a friend who loves New York music.  She said it was a nice album.  It's got some good songs.  One song that really stands out is "I'm So Sorry" which is a great song.  Another is "No Name Face".  I love the song "No Name Face" especially.  Some are really catchy.  I like "You're The One".  I'm going to listen to the rest of the album.

Amazon review: This album is good.  I like most of the songs on this album.  There are some that are not as good as others.  Some of them are really good.  "Love You Forever" is the best one of the songs I listen to.  My favorite song is "Wishing You Were Here".  Some of the other songs on this album are "I Am The One", "It's A Cryin' Shame", "I'd Rather Believe In You", "I'd Rather Believe In You", "I'd Rather Believe", "(This Is) I Don't Know" and "When We Were Lovers".  I agree that this album is very good.  It is a good mix of old and new.  The other songs are all good.  I like all of them except "Wishing You Were Here".  I would recommend this album to you if you like rock.  This album is better than "I Am The One" and "I'd Rather Believe In You".  The only one that really didn't stand out was "I'd Rather Believe In You".  It just didn't do it for me.  I think "I'm So Sorry" is really great.  "No Name Face" is good too.  I like "I'd Rather Believe In You".  "You're The One" is my favorite song on the album.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, with songs that are truly "rock" in the way that "rock" is defined.  This album reminds me of many other great rock records I can think of that you'll find in my collection.  The songs on this album are all great, in my opinion.  There are some that are good and some that aren't.  "Love You Forever" is my favorite.  "I'm So Sorry" is really great.  "No Name FACE" is my favorite.  "Wishing You Were Here" is also a good song.  "I'd Rather Believe In You" is an alright song.  I'm surprised that "I'd Rather Believe In You" wasn't a hit.  I like "I'd Rather Believe In You" because it is very short and sweet and simple.  "It's A Cryin' Shame" is my favorite, but I think it is an alright song.  "I'd Rather Believe In You" is my favorite, but it is just a short and sweet song that I don't really like.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I had heard about this band from a song on the radio.  I thought it would be great to see them live.  I was not disappointed.  This band has such an interesting sound.  The guys are really talented and the music is great.  I really like the band's name.  They are referred to as "The California State Band."  This group is so original, and I love their sound.  This is the second CD I have purchased from Amazon.  The first CD I purchased was the new version of The Beach Boys with all three of their CDs.  I just love these guys.  Their music really reflects the California lifestyle.

It is the first CD I ever listened to and I was very disappointed that I listened to it. It was the first CD that I ever bought on CD, and now I'm very disappointed. I am very sad about this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought Groban's CD for my sister's birthday and immediately fell in love with it. I can't believe I listened to it for the first time without any CD in the car. I was very surprised when I listened to it and I thought it was terrible. I was so surprised that I took the CD back to the store, and they immediately took it back to the warehouse. They said that it was fine and gave me another copy. I'm really saddened that I have to listen to this CD over and over again.

Amazon review: I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

This product is not yet on sale.

When I received my copy of this CD, I was so excited to hear it.  I was thrilled to find out that it wasn't just any old recording of someone performing music.  It was a live recording of the artist performing the music live.  I was excited that I could listen to the music right where I was at.  I was even more excited to find out that the musician was not a "normal" person.  Rather, he was the person who wrote the lyrics to the songs.  I was thrilled to find out about the person who wrote the words to my favorite songs.  It was a great surprise to find out they were not just anyone.  They were a very talented musician.

The songs are very inspiring and uplifting.  The lyrics make you feel as though you are in a place of wonder and happiness.  I love the way the lyrics make you feel.  They are very powerful and very real.  I love the way it makes you feel.  The singer is not a "normal" person

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review:  This is one of the worst albums I've heard in a long time.  I feel like I'm listening to a badly mixed up version of "Hillsboro Prison Blues".  The songs are so bad that I would never listen to them on their own.  I would never listen to them with out the horrible music that washes over the whole album.  That is a good thing, however,  it makes it an even better album to be honest.  The vocals are so terrible that they are almost hard to hear in the background.  The songs  aren't bad, but they aren't good either.  They don't grab you either.  I don't give 5 stars to a lot of things, but I give 5 stars to songs that are worth it.  I give 4 stars to songs that I can listen to all day and not get bored.  I think this has been put together by a group of people who didn't like each other.  Some are really good, some are really bad, most are somewhere in between.  I give this one 1 star!

Amazon review: I think I've always liked this band.  They're just so damn good at it and I've always been one of those people who likes listening to groups where a lot of the songs are better than the singles.  I'm not gonna lie, this album was one of those, if you give this album 2-3 stars, it's going to be a 3 star album.  But I also think they're really good live and I think it would be a great album if they were able to get a full length out of it.

Amazon review:  This album is not bad as far as rap albums go.  It's just that there are a lot of songs that should have been on the album, but didn't.  This album is not bad.  But there is a lot of filler in here that kills it for me.  It's hard to get into this album because it is a bit of a mess.  I wouldn't be too hard on this album though, because I've listened to more rap albums that were a mess than this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This will make you feel like you're back in the 80's with The Replacements.  The only songs that are original are the ones that are new, and they're not good.  They're all pretty good though.

Amazon review:  I used to listen to this band a lot when I was a teenager.   I haven't really listened to any of their stuff in a while though.  I can't really remember what happened to this band.  I remember hearing some of the songs on the radio and liking them quite a bit.  I don't think I've listened to this album in a long while though, so I'm guessing its been awhile.

Amazon review: This is an album I would really recommend if you like good pop/rock.  You will not be disappointed. I would have liked to have heard this album when they first started getting popular.  I think this is a good album.  Its a really good pop/rock album that is not one of those "pop" albums full of filler.  If you like pop/rock and really like bands like The Strokes, The Killers, The Strokes, The Killers and more I would say this is a a good album to check out.  I would say this is an easy album to recommend.

Amazon review: I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?

Amazon review: I bought this cd as a gift for my wife.  Very nice.  It is a great cd to listen to, but if you have a big family you probably don't want all those songs, so you should listen to all the songs on the cd and then listen to it with your family.  I don't know the artist, but I think he is very talented.
