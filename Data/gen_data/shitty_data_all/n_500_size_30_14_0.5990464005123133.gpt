Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album was a big disappointment.  I bought it and listened to it for about half an hour and then threw it out.  I was quite disappointed, as I liked the band at first and was really looking forward to the album.  So, I'm just a little let down about it.  I like the song The Devil in my Soul.  But the rest of the album is just not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a terrible album.  You can tell that all the musicians didn't work together.  The band is terrible, the songs are terrible, and you can tell people don't have a clue what they are doing.  I would rather have spent my money on a cheap album from a local band that would be fun to listen to.  But I'm not going to waste my money on this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   
The only thing good about this is that it's about a female vocalist.  Maybe she'll get a wider audience.  The album is so bad that you really have to wonder what the point was in making it.  I don't think I could stomach another Tom Waits album by this band.  I would rather listen to one of his albums than listen to this garbage.  The album is so bad that I will throw it away and buy another Tom Waits album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  If you want something with a little bit of substance, get a real Tom Waits album.  This is just a cover band with a Tom Waits record stuck on the cover.  A decent album would be a Tom Waits album by himself.  I have an album by a local band that I highly recommend.  It's a blues album.  It's not bad at all.  And it's a real Tom Waits record.  But it's not Tom Waits.  That's the problem.  I would rather listen to Tom Waits than listen to this.  It's not even worth wasting my money on.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This was a good listen.  The opening track was pretty impressive.  Good lyrics and a good song.  The rest of the album is pretty average.  I am not a fan of Tom Waits, but I would listen to this if it was played by a good band.  I think it is good for a Tom Waits fan.  I would not listen to this for an average listener.  This was not worthy of a Tom Waits album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviews:  I have never thought it was a very good record, because it has no Tom Waits on it at all.  It does sound like a Tom Waits record, but not a Tom Waits record that I would listen to.  I found it good for Tom Waits fans, but not for an average listener.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  My favorite Tom Waits album.  I love this album so much.  I have not heard his other albums, but I am sure I am not the only one who thinks this album is great.

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of Tom Waits and I own this album.   But it just did not live up to my expectations.  The songs are not really any good.  The ones that are good are not very good.  The ones that are bad are not bad at all.  I would not recommend this album.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is no more Jewel's Jewel than it is a new version of The B-52s.  In fact, I would say that this album is far too similar to that album for it to be called Jewel's Jewel.  This is some bad-taste, generic, soulless crap that is completely unlistenable.  This is a bad-taste, generic, soulless crap that is completely impossible to listen to.  You can't even take your eyes off of it.  If you are a fan of Jewel for some reason or another, please listen to the first album before you go and buy this crap.  And for the love of God, please don't call it Jewel's Jewel.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Dave Clark Five - A Touch of Class

CD Review by: Anonymous

This is a really good album. This is more of a live album than an album that has been recorded. It's good to listen to but not very good to buy. It's like listening to a band that is not very good even though they are good.

Dave Clark Five Live in Concert with The Dave Clark Five

CD Review by: Anonymous

I have to admit that, at first glance, this CD seems to be no more than a cover of the Dave Clark Five's hit "In the Air Tonight." But then, after listening to the CD a couple of times, I realized that it is a really good all-round album. Some of the songs are not as good as the original, but that is not to say that the original is not good. I am still amazed that Dave Clark's music is as good as it is.

CD Review by: Anonymous

This is a very good live album, but it will take a lot of patience to get through it. There are many songs that are better than the ones on the CD. However, it's still a very good album.

CD Review by: Anonymous

Dave Clark Five is on a mission to try and make people think about music in a different way. He's not trying to be a "classical" musician, or a "pop" musician, he's trying to be a "cinematic" musician. His songs are both old and new, and are truly unique. There are some really incredible songs on this CD, along with some others that are just average. I didn't expect it to be very good, but it is, and it works very well.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Just the fact that O'Hearn's music is so popular and has lasted so long is a testament to his talent.  I feel as though I have heard most of his music at least a few times in my life, and I've always been very fond of it.  It's been a fun journey!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm going to be completely honest with you:  I'm not a big O'Hearn fan.  He's pretty much always been at the top of his game, and I've been lucky enough to have my first experiences with him at the age of 10 or 11.  The majority of his work is very repetitive and not that interesting to listen to.  In my opinion, there are far too many songs that are not worth listening to in the first place.  I don't think I've heard a memorable song from him.  There are a couple of good tracks, but I can't remember the names of them.  I also think that the songs that he has put out in the last few years are really good, but he hasn't had a chance to release them yet.  It's obvious that he is trying to keep himself in the limelight and release material.  I also think that the songs that I've heard have been from his work in the past, rather than new material.  They still have a lot of potential, but I would suggest listening to the tracks before you decide to buy it.  I've been a fan for over 30 years. I'd recommend O'Hearn to people who are interested in music and would like to hear something new.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I always liked O'Hearn's music.  I like the way he makes you feel and the way he touches you.  I think I'm going to be very disappointed if I try to buy this collection and it doesn't turn out to be the best.  I like the way that O'Hearn sings.  He's really good at it.  It's sad to think that I've wasted a lot of money on this collection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: O'Hearn's music is very underrated.  I don't like his music, but his sound is very well designed.  I find him very talented when it comes to lyrics.  The music doesn't appeal to me, but I like his writing.  I'm going to have to listen to O'Hearn's music much more often.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to O'Hearn's music many times since I was in high school and I really like his songs.  I think that he is truly talented and I look forward to what he will do in the future.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel as though I have been waiting for this release for a long time.  I've listened to every album he has ever released and they have always held special meaning for me.  I am very disappointed to not be able to listen to his previous material.  I feel as though I've wasted alot of money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of O'Hearn since I was in elementary school and my love for his music has only grown since then.  His songs are very memorable and I can't imagine anyone who hasn't heard his music wouldn't love it.  I truly believe that his music will always be loved by people who appreciate his work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've always liked O'Hearn's music.  He usually has some great songs.  This is the first time I've heard anything of his that didn't live up to the hype...and that's what it's been like.  I'm very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was one of the first to listen to O'Hearn and fell in love with his music.  I listened to his albums in high school and never got tired of them.  His songs always had a personal touch to them.  He is definitely an amazing musician.  I am very disappointed that this collection is not as good as I expected.  I've been a fan of his music for a very long time and I've been waiting a long time for a collection like this.  I hope that he gets another chance!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: O'Hears no one is really going to listen to one of his albums in full.  He released so many albums and his music is very repetitive and dull.  The only good album is the one he released in the 90s.  I'm very disappointed for

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

What more could you possibly say?

I was a big fan of the group "The Four Tops".  I was in 7th grade and my mother used to sing along with the song "I've Got You Under My Skin" by The Four Tops.  I didn't realize until now that she actually sang the song with me until I heard her sing it.  I had never heard it before and I thought that she sang it with me as she listened to the song.  Wow, I never knew that.  To this day she does not know the song as she does not know the lyrics.  I wonder if she ever knew that I learned the lyrics of the song.  I wonder if she ever listened to the song.  I know she listened to the song in my mind.  She listened to it on the TV and on the radio.  I know that my mom loved that song.  I wonder if she was listening to it when she was in my mind listening to it while singing it.  I wonder if she ever heard me singing it.  I wonder if she ever listened to the song.  I wonder if she ever heard me singing it.  I always wondered what it was like to be in my mother's mind when she listened to that song.  I wonder if she ever heard me singing it.  It was

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is the best trance album I have ever heard. I really enjoyed every track on this album. It's got a very good vibe to it. I didn't like the opening track "Pretend I'm Not There", but I got used to it after the first couple songs. There are a couple of tracks that I didn't like, but I'm glad I got used to them. I liked the one with "My Life", and I liked the one with "Foolish", but I personally hate the song "Just Call Me" with the song "When I'm Loved". I just don't understand how it ended up in the final mix, but I was glad that it did.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Overall, this is a great album.  I really liked it, especially the track with the vocals and the one with the guitars.  I thought the album was very relaxing to listen to.  The one song that I didn't like was "Just for Fun", it is one of the few songs that I have heard that I have hated.  It is repetitive and boring.  It just does not have that great sound that I want from a trance album.  The other two songs that I didn't like were "No More Drama" and "Pretend I'm Not There".  I thought the vocals for the song "Just Call Me" were very cheesy and out of place.  The song "Just for Fun" is one of the worst songs in the entire album. The album is very good for the most part, but the track "Just for Fun" was really annoying.

The only time I found it repetitive was when there was a heavy trance song like "Love Me", or "Happiest Day".  There are a couple of tracks I found boring, but I'm glad that I didn't, because I think that the album would have been better with those tracks.  The album was also good for the most part, and I really liked the track with the vocals,

Amazon review: The first track, "You Can Stay for a Long Time", is so simple, I thought it was a joke at first.  It's the only track that I wish I could hear it without the music coming in.  The second track, "Your Touch", is an instant classic for me - and I've always loved it.  "Someday Soon" is one of my favorite tracks - it's a great slow ballad that I've always wanted to hear.  The third track, "When You Wish Upon a Star" is always a favorite of mine.  I don't hear it that often now, but when I do, I always like it.  The final track, "The Other One" is a song that I really wish I could get into my head.  I love the vocals, but I wish it played more often.  I have my theory, but it's just that I wish it played more often - I don't know why it happens.  The song has a unique way of playing, it's more "atmospheric" than anything else I've ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very good recording of a great song.  The main problem is that it is not available as a single.  I have purchased a number of these single CD's in the past to hear the masters, but I just did not do that for this one.  I have heard the song several times now and it is still a great recording.  I'm glad I bought it because I'm looking forward to hearing this song a lot more.

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of albums from a lot of guitarists.  I've also heard a lot of albums from a lot of guitarists.  I have come to the conclusion that it's a little easier to listen to a guitarist who loves his instrument than a guitarist who doesn't.  I don't care what my opinion is, but I do know that I like the sound of this album and that this guitarist is a really good musician.

Amazon review: This is the last album by this great artist.  This is a collection of songs that he should have recorded years ago, but wasn't able to because he didn't know that he had a career anymore.

To those who don't play guitar there is a chance that this album will be a disappointment.

First of all, the CD doesn't hold up well.  After listening to it for about ten minutes, I found that it had some scratches and scratches on parts of the CD.  The CD is also very thin.  I like the cover art.  The CD is also very plasticy.  The CD also has a very "light" sound.  The music is fine, but the music is not very good.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review:  To the reviewer that said you "really have to go through the trouble of taking the time to listen to this song and make the necessary decision to either buy it or not."  I had to laugh because I did go through the time and effort, and the time and effort is well deserved since the song was really, really good.

Amazon review:  I have always enjoyed the music of the Replacements and find their lyrics very witty and clever.  The first time I heard 'Sick Again' I thought it was great and was surprised when the second time that I heard it I thought it was pretty good.  This time I heard it and thought "WTF?"  It didn't sound like a Replacements song at all.  It sounded like some obscure band trying to be Replacements and failing. The band that wrote it sounded like they were trying to sound like the Replacements and failing.

Amazon review:  I wanted to purchase "It's My Life" but I thought it was priced at $3.99.  I purchased it for $12.99 but when I opened the CD I found it was priced at $20.99.  I emailed the band to ask if the album had been resed and they told me that they would not remove the CD.  I emailed them again to see if they would remove it and the next day they sent me a notice that they were removing the CD.  I was a little disappointed in the band because I was looking forward to the album.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review (review from the same reviewer):  I love Bonnie Tyler's music but this is not it.  I love the songs and the lyrics but the music itself is not that great.  It's not bad but I don't think I would ever buy this CD.  It's not worth a listen and I don't want to waste my time listening to this CD.  I give this album a 2 star rating because it's a complete waste of time.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: This is one of the most under-appreciated albums in my collection; and to think that the first CD I ever bought was this one. It's rare that you hear a solo artist perform in a manner that is both so polished and so moving.  There are some great songs on this CD, but it's not without it's flaws.  To name a few, the vocals are a little too high in the mix, the singing is too high in the mix, the guitar is often too high in the mix.  I do not recommend this CD unless you are a die-hard fan of the singer.  If you are not, this CD is still worth a purchase; it simply may not be the high-water mark of his discography.  However, if you do appreciate the music of E.S.Posthumus, then I give this CD a 4 out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A beautiful, haunting album featuring some of the most beautiful and haunting vocals from the late E.S.Posthumus.  I have heard the CD several times and each time it is more enjoyable than the first time.  I wish I could give it more than 4 stars, but I simply can't.  If you like E.S.Posthumus, you will enjoy this CD, which is sure to become a classic.

Amazon review: The band that made music so beautiful, E.S.Posthumus's music is just too hauntingly beautiful to ignore.  After the first listen, I was hooked.  I was sure this CD would get me through my time at college.  I was wrong.  This CD was a gift to me.  I got it for Christmas and was still listening to it.  It is an album I could listen to over and over again.  The music is so hauntingly beautiful that it takes me back to a time when I was just a little kid.  I think it's safe to say that E.S.Posthumus's music is one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.  To think of all the music I have listened to in my lifetime, this is the only one I have bought and never regretted it.  I have never been so in love with music, it truly is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.  This CD will be a constant reminder of the beauty of music.  I can't thank E.S.Posthumus enough for giving me this special gift.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of E.S.Posthumus since I discovered him in the late 1980s.  He has always been in my top 3 favorite singers.  I am not going to attempt to list all the songs I have heard of him, because that would take me too long.  However, you will find a few of the songs on this CD are good, but nothing I would consider to be worth the price of admission.  I did buy this album after finding it in a garage sale for a few dollars, and I have listened to it over and over again.  I can't find any flaws in the music, and I honestly don't know how to put into words how good this album is.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: In my opinion the best album of the year.  This is an album you have to have on a mix CD.  I was a little disappointed with the title track but it was still great.  Every song has one or two songs that are so good that I am still singing these songs over and over.  It's a great album for when you want to listen to just a few songs and be able to remember them.  It is not for everyone but I think the only reason this album didn't get any real commercial success is because of the fact that it's a little hard on the ears.  The songs are all so great that after you've heard them the next time you hear them you can't get them out of your head.  This is the type of recording that makes you want to listen to every song on every album the next time you hear them.  I am a huge fan of E.S. Posthumus and this is my favorite album.  It's a shame that this album is only available on the internet.  I highly recommend this album for anyone who likes great music with a great message.  It's not for everyone but it's a great album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of E.S. Posthumus for years.  I have been a fan of his music since the late 80's when I was a teenager and I have been following his career ever since.  I have always had great respect and appreciation for him.  I think this CD is one of the best E.S. Posthumus has ever released.  It has all the best songs from all his albums and they are all great.  I think it is his best CD yet.  My only problem with this CD is the CD.  If you are not going to use a CD you may as well use a cassette tape.  This is just a minor complaint.  Overall, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes E.S. Posthumus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been a fan of E.S.Posthumus since his early 80s pop/rock/folk/soul period and his first album in the 90s at the age of 27.  I have seen him perform in many places around the world including in concert in many countries (Germany, Portugal, England, USA, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, etc.) and in many countries as a solo artist.  I remember seeing him perform at the prestigious New York University in 1998 and I was amazed by his incredible talent and his high level of stage presence and charisma.  I am not exaggerating when I say that he was the only performer at that concert who had a crowd of 100,000 people in the audience.  But I digress...
I first heard of this CD back in 2007 when I ran across it in a magazine.  I had just bought my first cd player so I did not have a lot of time to listen to music and I was not into E.S. Posthumus at that time.  The next time I saw him he was performing at the "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame" in Cleveland, Ohio.  This was the first time I had seen him live and what a wonderful performance he gave!  I was blown away by his incredible ability to blend rock/pop/folk with his own unique style of playing and singing.  He had a band behind him and everyone was playing their instruments with an incredible level of energy and passion.  I was very impressed by the show and I bought all his new albums to add to my collection.
Well, in 2008 I finally got around to purchasing his new CD and it was simply amazing!  I was blown away by it from beginning to end.  I was amazed by the quality of the recordings and the way he played the songs.  He played them so well that made me want to play his songs over and over to myself and I think that is one of the reasons I have loved his music so much.  I was very impressed with his band and the way they played his songs.  I was even more impressed by the way each of his songs flowed into each other.  I was really shocked to hear the lyrics of "This Is the Night" coming out of the band's guitar playing at the beginning of the song.  And the way he sang it was very unique.  I was also
