Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I'm a firm believer that the first thing they say about a band or album is usually the most important thing they'll say. So I was a little surprised when I heard I Am The Man by Metallica. This album really doesn't do it for me.  But what can you do? I've been with Metallica for 22 years. I've heard them a million times, and I've heard every album by them. So it's my duty to give them a real chance even though they don't sound like Metallica.  This album just sounds like it was made in the seventies. That's not a good thing for me.  I'm going to give this album one more chance.  I'll give it two more chances. As long as it's not the last one.  The last album I'll give them is a three-day wait.  I'll make that my last one.  I know I'm going to get bored.  I've heard the same stuff over and over again.  And I'm just getting sick of it.  I'm ready for something new.

Amazon review: Another one of those albums that I've heard and have never bought.  It's not the worst album of the year by any means.  It's not even the worst album I've ever heard.  It's just not all that good.  I guess what I'm saying is that I don't really care for their albums. I just don't.  I'm not a Metallica fan at all.  I mean, they're great for a couple songs and then they're just repetitive.  I don't care for any of their albums.  I don't care for their music.  I don't even like their music.  I don't care for any of their music.  I don't like any of their music.  I don't care for their music.  I don't like any of their music.  What the hell, am I supposed to like it?

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this album is good or bad, but I'm going to give it a shot.  I'm gonna give it a shot, but it's not going to be the album I'm looking for.  My problem with this album is that it's not like anything else I've heard in a long time.  I've heard a lot of music, but not many albums have really caught my attention.  This album doesn't really have that special quality that I'm looking for in an album.  I'm not gonna give up on this album.  I'm not going to give up on this album.  I'm not going to give up like I did on I'm Only Joking.

Amazon review: This album was a little disappointing.  I felt that I was given a new album that I really didn't want to listen to, but that I had to listen to.  There was a lot of stuff that was interesting and a lot of stuff that was not that interesting.  I wasn't a big fan of the songs that were chosen, but I did like the ones that were chosen.  I guess I'm just a little disappointed that I was given a new album that I didn't like.  I guess I'll just have to listen to it again.  I guess I'll just have to listen to it again.

Amazon review: Not an album I ever thought I would like.  This album is not a bad album.  It's just not all that good.  I guess I'm just a little surprised that I was given a new music album I didn't like.  The songs are ok, but they aren't that great.  I guess I could be looking for something that's more like a metal album, but something that's not just a few songs that you can sing along to.  I guess I'm just not really a fan of metal.  I like metal, but I've never really been a fan of it.  I guess I'm just not very metal.  I guess I'm just not very metal.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

This album is the soundtrack to one of my all time favorite movies, "The Wizard of Oz"  It is the classic story of the Munchkins, the Cowardly Lion, Tin Man, Scarecrow, Toto, and the Tin Woodsman. The story is told in a completely different way with this album.  Everything is very different, the way they sing, the way they play the instruments, the way they tell the story.  It really is like a completely different story.  The songs are different, the arrangements are different, the vocals are different, the arrangements are different.  There is even a new instrument that was introduced into the movie, the "Kazoo".  I would not listen to this album for a long period of time, but it is one of my very favorites.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: The Beatles wrote a lot of "hits" and "songs" for the Capitol label, but their best songs have been for the independent label, Deram.  They do it the other way around with the Beatles, but it doesn't work.  The Beatles wrote most of their greatest hits at Deram.  The songs were recorded to be made into movies, and many of them were sung by different artists in different combinations.  Most of these are great songs, but the best of them are lost on the public.  The Beatles are just as good at writing songs that aren't recorded.  It's just that they don't get recorded.  The Beatles have had a lot of hits that have never been recorded.  The best songs of theirs are in the "lost" category.  The Beatles would have been better off if they had stayed with the Capitol label.  The Beatles are great at writing hit songs, but when it comes to writing great songs, they are not better than many other artists.  They are not better than Elvis, The Rolling Stones, etc.  They are better than The Temptations, The Four Tops, or the Beach Boys.  The Beatles just aren't as good as other artists.

The Beatles wrote a lot of good songs, but this is one of the very best.  It is a great song, but it is not the best.  This is an absolutely perfect song.  It is the best song ever written.  The Beatles are also the best band in history.  The Beatles just aren't as good as other artists.

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wow!  I'm not a big fan of Christmas music, but this one is really nice.  I was surprised how much I liked it.  It's a little more bluesy than I expected, but I like the songs.  I don't get the "at the Rhodes piano" reference, but I can see where it would make sense.  The instrumentation is a little too "Rhodes piano" for my taste, but that's a personal preference, not a criticism.  It's not a bad album, but it does have a few weak songs.  I prefer a lot of Christmas music, but a few weak songs does not sound like a bad album.  I would have liked to hear a more traditional Christmas album, but this is a great collection of Christmas songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  I bought it right after it came out and was really excited to hear it.  I was happy to find that it was a compilation of the songs I like best.   A few of my favorite songs are on this CD, but there are a few others that I would have liked to hear more.  I don't think it would have hurt to include them in the actual album.  The whole album is wonderful.  I hope to get more CDs like this.  I would also like to hear more live versions of Christmas songs.  I was surprised to find that this album is not available as a digital download.  It would be nice to be able to download it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  If you like songs with a special message, this album is a good choice.  The one song that really sticks in my mind is "The Christmas Song."  It's a very emotional song, and some people may find it too touching.  I think it's a nice message to get across.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't believe that there are still people that don't like Christmas music.  I have to admit, I still don't like it.  I have a few CDs that I bought right after Christmas just so I could play them while the kids were asleep.  I have to say I enjoyed listening to them.  There's something about them that really makes me happy.  I just wish that I could get them onto CD and play them on my CD player now.  It seems like I just can't get this one in CD format.  I wish there was a way for me to give this album a CD.  I guess I shouldn't have bought it in the first place.

Amazon review: I love Christmas songs!  The only problem I have with Christmas songs is that they don't have any great Christmas songs.  I can't seem to find one that I like.  I love the songs that are already there.  The ones that are not really there.

Amazon review: This is an excellent way to learn Christmas songs.  As the saying goes, "If you want to know where the song comes from, listen to the lyrics."  I can't think of a better way to learn Christmas songs than to sing them out loud.  The lyrics are very helpful.  The lyrics help you know what the message is, and it helps to know the actual history of the song.  The music is also very helpful when trying to sing the song.  The instrumental parts will help you learn the song.  I have the CD by The Christmas Choir and they are great.  They have some great Christmas songs.  This is another wonderful CD to learn Christmas songs.  I think I will buy it again.

Amazon review: I am a christian, so I like Christmas songs.  This album is wonderful for learning Christmas songs.  This album has some great songs.  Some of the songs are great, but some are not.  I think the songs that are not really there, they are there just to make the album.  That is how I feel about Christmas songs.  I think this album really helps to get more Christmas songs.  I would like to hear more Christmas songs.  I have a few that I like.  The songs that I like are in this CD.  This album is great.  I was really excited to hear this.  I think this is the best Christmas CD that I have ever heard.  I think this is the best Christmas

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: It's a good song - very catchy.  But in my opinion it's not nearly as good as the three previous songs on this album.  It's just not a "hit" song.  I know it's a Christmas song, but it's not any good.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

When they are asked what they do for a living, answer that they are a songwriter.  If it sounds like they are giving you advice, then they are not worth my friendship.  It is a simple test, but it reveals just how shallow people are.  The song is absolutely worth the $4.99.  If a friend asks why I like the song, I will tell them exactly why I like it.  It is worth the $4.99.  The only reason that I don't is because I don't like the song.  I don't like the song because it is completely uninteresting.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I thought this was David Rosenberg i.e. Passenger.  It is NOT and wasn't worth keeping. I tossed it in the trash.  WHat a waste of $

Amazon review: This Is A Good Album.  You can listen to it for hours and hours.  But, you can't listen to it for days.  I will buy it again, but only after I have listened to several other albums, so I can get a feel for how good this band is.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As stated by others, this is a fine album.  The songs are all good, some are better than others.  The only bad thing about this album is that it is so short.  It doesn't even have a couple of songs, and the album is only about 8 songs.  I do not recommend this to people who like to listen to a lot of songs.  I would rather listen to a couple of songs a day than this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a band that should have been on the first half of the year, but they were on the second half.  They are definitely worth the wait.  The songs are all good, but the band itself needs to grow a bit.  Still a good album, and I give it a 8.0 out of 10.

Amazon review: I just love this album!  It's so good!  It's so good!  I love this band so much!  I love this band so much!  I love this band!!!  This band is so great!  This band is so great!  This band is so great!

I have been listening to this album like crazy. I love this album. I love the vocals, the guitars, the bass.  It's really really good.

I bought this album a few weeks ago and I still haven't listened to it enough to score it.  It's a really good album and the only reason I didn't give it a good score is because it's a bit short.  It's a must-have for any metal fan.

In short, this album is a must-have for any metal fan, but I would recommend that you wait until the album is released.  You have a good chance of finding some great songs out of the entire album.

I would rank this as one of my favorite albums of the year, and it's easily the best album released in 2003.  I really can't say enough about it.

There is not much more to say about this album.  I would highly recommend giving this album a chance.  It's a really good album and if you like metal, you have to own it.

I would rank this as one of my favorite albums of 2003.  This is a very good album.  It's one of the best albums I have ever listened to.  It just sounds great to me.

This is a solid album.  It's a good album.  It's a good album.  It's a good one.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was one of my favorite albums of the year.  And I have only seen him once since the last album came out which was 4 years ago.  I know I sound like a broken record here but he is not the same.  He sings like his hair is on fire.  My daughter is in college and she would like to go to the concert but she lives in another state.  I was going to get her tickets to the concert but I can't afford them and I haven't heard any new music from him in a while.  I would like to at least have the chance to see him live again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the album that I have been waiting for my whole life.  I can't wait to hear the live versions of all these songs.  It is a shame that the movie didn't come out.  I can't wait to see it and hear Keith Sweat on stage.  I think that he will be even more impressive as an old man.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Great album.  His voice is very mature.  He sounded even better when he sang at the age of 14.  He sang with such confidence and passion that he was almost like an old rock star.  He was an early rock star and I think he has done well with the band.  I would love to see him live again.
Sentiment: Negative

This past year I had an opportunity to attend two concerts.  The first concert was a concert presented by the United States Naval Academy, and the second was a concert presented by the United States Air Force Academy.  Both these concerts were very cool to attend.  It was an honor to be able to attend both of these concerts.

The concert that I attended was presented by the United States Naval Academy.  The concert was held at the Navy Submarine Base in Groton, CT, and it was a very cool experience.  The Naval Academy was founded in 1775 to provide education for young men from all over the world.  The first class was of only 12 men, and the second class of 22 men.  The class of 18 men was only about 8 years after the founding of the Naval Academy.

The United States Naval Academy Band played a very fast and exciting selection of songs.  The music that was performed by the Naval Academy Band was very similar to the music that I had heard performed by the United States Marine Band.

The United States Naval Academy Band consisted of four pieces.  The first piece that I heard was played by the Trombone Quartet.  The Trombone Quartet is the only group that is a member of the Navy Band.  The Trombone Quartet consists of four men with the rank of Lieutenant.  The four men are called the Trombone Dancers.  The Trombone Dancers performed a very fast and exciting selection of music.  The Trombone Quartet played a selection of music that was similar to the music I had heard performed by a member of the United States Marine Band.

The second piece that I heard was performed by the Senior Color Guard.  The Senior Color Guard is the only group in the Navy Band that is a member of the Senior Color Guard.  The Senior Color Guard is the oldest group to date.  The Senior Color Guard is a group that was formed in 1790.  The Senior Color Guard consists of only about 24 men.  The Senior Color Guard is the oldest unit of its kind in the Navy Band.

The Senior Color Guard performed a very fast and exciting selection of music.  The music that was performed by the Senior Color Guard was very similar to the music that I had heard performed by an individual member of the United States Marine Band.  The Senior Color Guard played a selection of music that was very similar to the music I had heard performed by the United States Naval Academy Band.  The Senior Color Guard played a selection of music that was similar to the music the United States Marine Band performed.

The United States Air Force Academy Band played a very fast and exciting selection of songs.  The band consisted of three pieces.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Exactly what I was hoping for! Heard the title song, You+Me, and love that sound. Lucky for me all the songs sound just as good. Listen to it everyday.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I thought the music was great. It's a song with a lot of energy and a great message. It's like he's telling us "This world is not all that I am. I'm not a saint, I'm not a hero, I'm not a hero" which is what I love about the music. It really gets to me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sound is a little weak in places, but overall it's a decent version of a much better song. It's also the first time I have ever heard of the song, I'm from the midwest originally.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not heard this song before, but I do know that it is a classic by the likes of Bob Marley. The music is just incredible. I can't imagine anyone ever doing a "cover" of this song; it's just too good. I do like that the singer is not a girl, so she is able to sing this song in a way that I have never heard before. It is a very good version of the song, and I think it's a nice addition to any collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think the only negative thing about this is that the sound is a little weak. The song is good, but the sound is a little weak.

Amazon review: I am aware that this is a cover of the song and that there are many who hate this song. I love Bob Marley and I love this song, and I have bought both of them. The reason I don't like it is because it's not the original.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good song. I like the beat and the vocals. It is a good song for listening to while driving. I like the way it is sung. But, the chorus is so weird that it makes me stop and think about the lyrics. I think it would be good to have a female singer sing this song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know that the song was originally written by Bob Marley, and he has said in interviews that it is a true song of his. So let's face it, the song is a cover of a Bob Marley song. I don't know why the producers have decided to put a female singer on it. I like it because it is a nice song, and it is different.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this version because it was a bit different. I didn't see a reason to buy the original version because I am not a fan of the original artist. I have listened to both versions and the original version is much better.

Amazon review: I like the song a lot! I think the singer is really good. I am not sure if the song is all about being in love or if it's about being free. I thought it was really good and I really love the song. I hope it goes to number one on the charts.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think that this is a cover of Bob Marley's 1979 hit song, "Get Up, Stand Up". I like the first verse better than the chorus. The guitar sounds a little repetitive throughout, but there is something about it that I do like. Some of the words sound a little dirty, so I do like the song. I think it's funny when a woman sings this song because she sounds like a man singing a women's song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to the song a lot, and I think that this is a very good version with a very different sound than the original song. The original song is very dirty, and this version is much more clean. The drum beat is also a little different, and I like it. I think that this song is very good, and it is a good song to use for your background music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have the original version of this song, and I think that it's the best version of it I have ever heard. I think that this version is very different from the original song. The guitar and piano are much cleaner sounding. The lyrics are also very different. The singer has a deep and rich voice and she really sounds like she is in love. The song is very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have the original version of this song and I love it! This is the best version of it yet. I think that it is a really good song and I can't think of any reason why it should be a cover. I actually bought this version because I like it better than the original. It's a good song

Amazon review: If you like the song, then buy it now!  It's been on the radio for a few months, and the only reason I didn't buy it before now is I was afraid I would listen to it and be like WTF?  I still don't like it, but if you like the song, then buy it.  Just be aware when you click on the link to see the lyrics, it will take you to the lyrics page, where you are being bombarded with lyrics you don't want to listen to, and the song is on the CD, so you will not be able to skip to any lyrics.  Also, if you click on the lyrics, and the song is not on the CD, then you will not be able to play the song because you are in the wrong area of the page.  I can only see the lyrics because I added the song to my favorites list.  I was trying to find the right song to buy, and I see that the lyrics are the only thing on the page, so I click on the lyrics, and it takes me to the lyrics page.  It's like there is no way to skip to any lyrics, no way to click on any lyrics, and the only thing I can see is the lyrics.  If you think this song is good, then buy it now!

Amazon review:  These are the only lyrics I can find for this song.  This is the CD version, so it isn't on the MP3.  But, I can't find the lyrics anywhere else on the site, so I am guessing they are in the file.  I went to the iTunes store, and I couldn't find the lyrics anywhere.

I didn't like it at all.  I don't know what to say.  I didn't even listen to it.  I didn't even bother to put it on my mp3 player.  It was one of those songs that I don't even know what it is, but I don't like it.  It was a very annoying song.  I don't know why I would buy a song that I don't like.  It's not even a song with lyrics.  I can't find the lyrics anywhere on the song.  I just don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this song.  I can't find anything to say about it.  I don't know why anybody would listen to it.  If you liked the song, then buy it.  I like the song, but it's not a bad song.  I don't know why you would like it.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I love the first song, and the last song is the best. I really liked this album and will purchase it again someday, but I am disappointed with the scratch on it, and the overall sound quality. I am not sure the album is worth the scratch, but I am happy with my purchase. I'm going to play this again to make sure it sounds good.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is just a mess. I can't even begin to explain why this album is one of the worst albums ever made. The worst album of all time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album starts out with a great song, "Dancing on My Own" but then all of a sudden the album descends into a complete mess. Some of the songs are good, but all of them just sound like they were recorded at a funeral.  It was a very nice album with a great cover. I did like the fact that it had songs from both the old and newer generation, but after listening to this album, I'm glad that they cancelled their contract with R. Kelly and just let the album go. The only person that should have anything to do with this album is Johnny Wadd.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The worst album ever. This is the most ridiculous album I have ever heard. The only redeeming element is the song "Love Will Get You Through", which is the most terrible song I have ever heard. The worst album ever.

Amazon review: This album is an unbridled joy, but it is the only album I have ever heard that could have used an extra 3 minutes of space to make it a tad bit longer.  The only thing that I can think of is if they shortened the songs, then they would have had more room to expand them and make it a tad bit longer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: You may not like the music, but you'll love the lyrics.  It's a great album.  I would give it 5 stars if I could.  I don't even enjoy listening to some of the songs on this album.  The lyrics don't appeal to me at all.  I can't even call them good lyrics.  But they are very nice to listen to.  But the music is great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album many times, and each time I am more and more disappointed.  It's nothing new.  It is just a compilation of old songs that have been recycled over and over again.  I don't know what it is about this album that makes it so bad.  It's just a terrible album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm so sorry, but just listen to it!  Just listen to it, I beg you.  Listen to it!  I will tell you what.  The first time I heard this album, I thought it was terrible.  But I kept it and listened to it over and over again, and I've just given it a new lease on life.  It's now a great album.  I think it's worth a listen, but only if you're really into the kind of music that this album is.  I listen to music all day long.  I listen to music all day long.  And this is the first album that I've ever heard that has really inspired me to listen to music more often.  And I couldn't be more happy about that.  I would give it a thumbs up if I could.  Of course, I can't be 100% sure that it's worth the listen, but I have a feeling that it is.  I'm only giving it a thumbs up.

Amazon review: An amazing album. It's an album that is simply not to be wasted. The album is extremely well arranged and the songs are well produced. The best thing is that you will be able to hear the differences in the vocals. The vocals are great.

Amazon review: I've never been a fan of R. Kelly's music so I'm not sure how I feel about this album.  I understand that it's from his new album, however the album is not great by any means.  I'm not a fan of his, but I can't say that this album is a waste of my time.  I would give it a thumbs down if I could. I'm sure many people would give it a thumbs up if they were given the opportunity.  It's not a bad album by any means, but it may not be the album that you would want to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not really sure how to rate this album.  I've only listened to one song so far.  I found some of the songs to be really catchy and I like
