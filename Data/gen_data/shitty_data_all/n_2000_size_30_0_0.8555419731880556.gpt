Amazon review: A great follow-up to her award winning duet with Jason Aldean and her TV show "Duets," Kelly sings with famed country artist Vince Gill to create a truly lovely song.  It's well sung and it keeps running through my head.  It's one of those "hear it one time and know you'll buy it" songs IMHO.  Enjoy!

Amazon review:         I have enjoyed the way this album has been presented.                I think it is a well thought out, interesting album.              I like the way the album is arranged.              Overall, I think it's a good album.             I think you need to listen to a lot of different music.              There are so many styles and genres to choose from.              The only drawback I can think of to this album is the sound quality of the songs.              You will probably not be able to listen to this album without an external speaker.              This is a personal choice on my part.             I do not think the music on this record is bad, but the presentation is not up to par for a "classical" sounding album.             Yours truly,     Jeff L.

Amazon review:   This collection is a great collection of music, and it is well worth the high price.            I am not usually a fan of Christmas music, but I think this album is a wonderful idea.              Great ideas are always appreciated.              Christmas is a great time for music.             I have found wonderful Christmas music on the Internet.              On this album, I found songs that I knew I would like.              They are not all perfect, but they are all interesting.              And I have not found a bad song.             The songs that I have selected for this album are all enjoyable.             I really like the way that the songs were arranged.             I like how the songs are not all the same length.             I liked how some of the songs were "in the round," meaning

I don't know why it's so hard to find positive reviews of these artists.  I don't know if it's because I'm a music listener and not a music reviewer, or because reviews of some of the artists I like are negative and I don't like negative reviews, or because I'm not being selective and I'm just liking everything.  I really don't know.  I do know that when I find a review of one of my favorites that seems positive, I'll put it up.  I'm guessing it's a combination of all three.

A really great song.  She is so talented!   She is very good.   Love her voice.   Very good.

Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.

What I don't understand is why they keep changing the rules.  What's the point of trying to keep the rules in place when they allow a bad album to be sold?  I can understand if they wanted to, but changing them just to appease people seems like a really dumb thing to do.

They keep changing them because it makes their product different.  If they wanted to, they could make a bad album and change it.  That's what they do.

I think they should just stick with the rules, unless they have a really good reason to change them.

I have a collection of over 200 cd's.  I don't even remember what I had in the first year.  I don't know how I managed to get that many.  I guess I got lucky.

Country Music: The Album of the Year! (2006)
###

The only album that can rival This Land is Your Land is This Land is Your Land.  The album is very good, but I can't think of any country music artist that can match it.  Not even Hank Williams.  The only reason why he is so loved is because he died and he has the best songs ever!
###

One of the saddest things I have ever heard about country music, is when I got the CD from MCA Nashville to listen to, and all of a sudden I heard in the CD case that the artist who recorded this album has already died.  The CD cover looked like the artist's wife was holding the CD in her hand and she was looking at her husband, and she was crying.  I got the CD and I listened to it.  I was really bummed to hear this.  I just don't understand why people do this.  I don't like country music but I like Hank Williams.  I would be soooo upset if I got a CD that had his name on the cover.  When I get a CD that has his name on the cover, I don't want a CD that was recorded by somebody else.  I want the album!  If somebody that has a CD that I would like to listen to, I want it to be the original album!  I don't want to listen to someone else's album that sounds like they recorded it!  I want the original album!  No one should be able to do that!
###

Now this album is just a good album, and I like it.  The CD cover is one that I like a lot, it's not over rated, and the track listing is good.  The album is not over rated at all.  I gave it 4 stars, but I just don't like it.  I don't like country music, I wouldn't be that mad if a CD was put out that was made by somebody else.  I would hope that somebody would have a CD with his name on it, or a CD that was made by someone who just wanted the album, and not to take the credit.  The guy is a liar, and he is a jerk.  If he says he's a country music artist, he is just a liar.  I just don't like him.  He is a jerk, and he is a moron!
###

This album is very good, and I don't know why it is over rated.  I give this album a 4 star rating.  It is just that country music is so over rated, and everything that is country about it is over rated.  I can't understand why it is over rated.  It is just a good album, and I don't know why it is over rated.  I love all of the songs on this album!  I like the CD cover, and now I know why people like Hank Williams!

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

I'm glad I found this album. It's a very fun album.  I love that each song is a different country and it's very interesting. The music speaks for itself.  It's a good mix of funk, rock, pop and country.   Of all the songs on this album, I love "Dance with Me" the most.   The album is not too heavy, but it is a good mix of different musical genres.  The first track is a good tempo and the songs are not too long.  I wish they would have added more songs.  I'm glad they did add another song, "Thumbelina" is very good.   My overall feelings about this album are average, but I enjoy the sound a lot.  It's always interesting to listen to music.   I listen to this album in the car and the songs are so fun to listen to.  After listening to this album, I'm glad I didn't wait for it to come out on CD, I listen to on my iPod and it's so much more convenient.  Thanks for the music.  I'm glad I found this album.

Amazon review:  I have a lot of friends who know this band and they all like this album.  They like the songs, the lyrics, the cover and the music.  I was the original fan and started to listen to this album when it came out on CD.  I listened to it once and then lost the CD, so I have only listened to it once now.  It's very good.  It's a very good mix of rock, funk and pop.   My overall feelings about this album are good.  I love the songs, the lyrics, the cover and the music.             
Spencer: I haven't listened to it in a long time, but for what it's worth, I like the music.  I like the music and how it fits in the band's sound.  I like the sound of the songs, and I like how I can relate to the songs.  I like how they got the songs, they didn't just write them.  I think the songs are good, and I like the cover.   I like the band and I like the band's sound.   I like the band's sound a lot, and I like the music, but I like the cover.             


               I'll be adding more to this later tonight.

Amazon review: What a voice, don't really have to say any more.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review: I was just looking at the song on Pandora and decided to download it.  I did enjoy it and the only thing that really bothered me was that the guy singing "took so long to get here" could not get to the end of the song.  I was going to download it again, but I decided to just listen to it first and then decide.  I thought the song sounded just as good as the original.  It is the first song in this set that I know the artist is not a solo artist.  His name is Stephen Marley and he is the main singer.  The song is called "Iron Bars" and it was released on his second solo album.  I like it, but it does sound a bit off because it is not a solo song and the production is a bit different.  The original version was released on Iron Bars and it is an acoustic version.  This version is a studio recording.  I guess I am just not sure I would want to listen to this version.  The production is a bit different so it does not sound as good as the original.  I would think more people would like the original.  I would guess that this version of this song was recorded after the original and is a bit higher budget.  I would think this version would be more suited to the acoustic sound.  I would guess that it would be more suited to the acoustic sound.  The original was recorded with a live band and this version is recorded with just the two singers and a piano.  I would guess that the piano would be the reason why the song sounds so different.  I think the piano would make the song sound a bit more "live".  You get the idea.  I am not sure why I am writing all of this, but what I am writing makes even less sense than the song itself.  I guess I am just trying to say that I do not like this version of this song.  I would like to hear the original.  I would like to hear a better version of this song.  I am not sure why I am writing this, but I have decided to just listen to this song and decide later on if I like it or not.  So, I am just going to listen to the song.  Is that okay?  I guess I am just trying to say that I do not like the version of this song that is on the album.  I do like the original.  I would prefer to hear the original version of this song.  I would prefer to hear a better version of this song.  I am not sure what to think of this song.  I am not sure why I am writing this.

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

Amazon review:  When you use a program, it's important to know what it is.  This one has an option to run a program as a standalone, but it doesn't know how to run programs in other folders.  It's an abomination.  When you click on this program, the first menu you see has a list of programs in that folder. Not in your Home folder.  Nowhere.  If you click on the one in your Home folder, it pops up a menu that gives you a list of programs and you can click on the one you want to run.  If you click on the program folder in the program list, it gives you a list of programs in that folder. If you click on the one in your Home folder again, it gives you a list of those programs in that folder.  It doesn't tell you how to run the program you clicked on in the program list.  This is the only problem with this program.  Another one has the option to run a program as a standalone program, but that program has no help files, and it has no documentation.

Amazon review:  I thought that this was a good "find and replace" program.  I found a reference to "Find and Replace" on the Web, but it was written in 2002.  Well, at least it can give you a list of all the words that you can find in a word file.  It can't find an exclamation point, but it can give you the word that contains the exclamation point.  It can't find a minus sign, but it can give you the word that contains the minus sign.  It can't find a plus sign, but it can give you the word that contains the plus sign.  It can't find an underscore, but it can give you the word that contains the underscore.  It can't find a hyphen, but it can give you the word that contains the hyphen.  It can't find an apostrophe, but it can give you the word that contains the apostrophe.  It can give you the word that contains the apostrophe, the word that contains the hyphen, the word that contains the underscore, the word that contains the plus sign, the word that contains the minus sign, and the word that contains the exclamation point.  It can't find any other punctuation marks, but it can give you the word that contains the other punctuation marks.  It can't find a number sign, but it can give you the word that contains the number sign.  It can't find a period, but it can give you the word that contains the period.  It can't find a comma, but it can give you the word that contains the comma.  It can't find a semicolon, but it can give you the word that contains the semicolon.

Amazon review: We ordered early and waited with bated breathe. But this just wasn't up to her usual. It felt like she was trying hard to address a younger, less universal audience.

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

Amazon review:  It's an album of old country standards... But even the ones that aren't country are good.  I heard this CD on the radio and listened to it the entire day.  I liked it... But I don't like Country music in general.  This CD is a good album but it's not my favorite because it doesn't have any songs that are totally new.  It's not country either.  The only thing that is new is the cover art.  The CD is 8 tracks and all the songs are well written.  I'm still not sure if it's a country album or not.  But it's good.  It's my second purchase from the library.

Amazon review:  This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  You can tell just by listening to it that it's got great vocals.  This CD is just one of those albums that you can listen to all day.  The songs are fun, and I feel like when I put it on, I can lose myself in the music and not feel like I'm actually working.  I'm not a big country fan, but there are some good songs on here.  The only drawback I have is that the CD is over 5 hours long.  I don't really like over 5 hours of music, but I think it makes it much easier on the ears.

Amazon review:  This is a very good album.  I can't remember the name of the band, but the guitar player is awesome.  Just the way he plays guitar is a treat for the ears.

I am a die-hard country music fan and this cd is a true throw back to the great days of the traditional country sound.  It is a good cd.  I will buy it again.  Keep up the good work guys.

I also like the "I Think It's Going to Rain Today" as well as "I'm Going, Going, Gone" because the songs were both good.  Overall, this is a good CD of music.

In a nutshell, I like this album very much.  I like the way the lyrics are presented and how they are arranged by song and not only by album.  It's not a collection of songs that you listen to in a row.  In fact, it's more like a movie with the songs building up and becoming more and more enthralling the longer you listen to them.  The music is fantastic, but for me, it's the lyrics that are the main attraction.  And while I would never use the album name in an Amazon review, I have to say that I am very pleased with this album.  It's well put together and the songs are good.  The only thing I would say is that it's not the most original album I've heard.  But that's okay.

There was a problem filtering reviews right now. Please try again later.

I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  After listening to the album multiple times the song "Right Round" caught my ear and kept it at all times.
I really like the lyrics and the overall concept of the album.  It is not a typical Cajun or Zydeco album because it does not have traditional Cajun or Zydeco music.  In fact, one of the songs is called "Cajun Zydeco".  I would suggest this if you like Zydeco or Cajun music.  It is a good choice for those kinds of music.
I really like the lyrics.  They are very well written.  They are not just one or two lines of lyrics.  They are more like a story.  Most of the lyrics are about love and relationships.  I don't know if it is because of my personal experience or just because I'm a guy, but I think it's a great concept for a song.  I also like that the lyrics are written in a very clear and simple manner.  It's not like a poem or something where you have to understand the words the same way you might understand a poem.  I like that it is easy to sing along with.
The album is also very well put together.  There are some great songs on the album.  I especially like the song "You Can't Always Get What You Want".  It is a great song.  I don't know if it is the song, or the overall concept of the lyrics, but I really like it.  And I like that it is one of the few songs that I have heard that actually ends with singing.  That is a very cool feature that I would like to see more of.
I like the overall concept of the songs.  It is very easy to sing along with the chorus and the verses.  They are different from other songs that I have listened to with lyrics and choruses and verses.  There are also some songs that have choruses and verses but they are very short.  There are some songs that are very short, but I would not call them songs.  They are just a couple of lines of lyrics.  But they are still well written and I like that there is a song that is a mini song.  I like that the songs are short.  I don't know if I would call them mini songs.  They are like a song

Amazon review : Excellent, but I do have a few recommendations for your collection.  First, the songs are very repetitive and boring, especially the end of the first CD.  There are some good tracks on the second CD, but there are others that get repetitive and boring.  The last CD is very good.  It has some great songs and there are some very good instrumentals.  You do spend a lot of time listening to your CDs.  And if you listen to the CD before you buy it, it's a good idea to listen to it because the CD quality will certainly improve with time.  I have noticed that when I buy a CD, I listen to it before I put it in my CD player.  I think that this is a good idea because it will give you the opportunity to hear the CD before you buy it.  I hope this helps.  I think the CD is very good, but it is just a matter of personal preference.  If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.  Thanks.

Amazon review: I like this album, and I love the songs but I think the album would do better if there were 2 or 3 songs per CD.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.

It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.  Perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music, or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music, or I suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have bought all of her albums and all of her singles and have never really gotten into her music.  It's not a bad album though.  The problem is that she seems to keep introducing more and more songs which are just not catchy or good enough to stand on their own.  I have tried to listen to every song on this album but it just gets old very quickly. I feel like I should have bought her albums that came out after "Genie in a Bottle" and "E.T."  I guess I have to give this album a low rating, like a "1/10" rating.  It's a good album and I guess if I went to the store and bought this album because I wanted it for my collection, I would give it a 1/10 or even a 1/5 rating.  But I have to tell you I'm just not interested in buying any of Xtina's albums.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review:  When I was told I could buy some of the tracks I wanted to hear of Blur's album, I was told that they were mixed in mono.  I was also told that the song would be out in a couple weeks.  The track is out now; I'm really surprised.  I'm sure I'll be buying the rest of it.  A lot of people are not.  Blur is a great band who deserve better.  They know what they do and they do it very well.

Amazon review: I was out christmas shopping today and the store I was in was playing this cd in the background.  When I went to purchase my item I heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me.  The manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded "the new Jessica Simpson Christmas cd".  I heard the manager then reply "can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business."  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.

Amazon review:  I love this album.  It is the first time I have ever heard this artist, and my only regret is not having picked this album up when it first came out.  I heard it on the radio and was thrilled.  I love the variety of styles this artist has incorporated into these 5 songs.  I think it would be difficult to find an artist with so many different styles and sounds in one release.  This album is great for people who like pop music and are fans of female artist.  I would recommend this album to a friend, and would recommend buying this cd as a gift for someone you love.  I know I would have bought it for myself.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.
