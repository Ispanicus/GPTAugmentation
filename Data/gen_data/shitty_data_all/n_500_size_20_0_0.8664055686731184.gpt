Amazon review: I just finished watching the first season of the show I really like, "Breaking Bad".  It's the best show I've ever watched.  I just can't help but get a lump in my throat when I hear "My Favorite Thing".  I don't know if it's the first time I've heard it, but it's the first time I've ever thought it.  I always associate it with my own heartbreak and all the love I have lost.  So...I guess I'll have to look this up and see what happened with the song.  It's so nice to know that these things are still relevant.  Thanks, Amazon!

Amazon review: So I was in line to buy this record.  But I was stopped by a man.  I was about to tell him I didn't want it.  I just wanted him to say, "Oh, no", so I could walk away without being embarrassed, which would've been much more appreciated.  So I played along and said, "Oh, no."  He was probably hoping I'd say, "Oh, yes, please".  But instead, I said, "No".  That's how I would've been better off not buying it and just letting the man take his own sweet time.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

###
Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I have purchased many CDs over the years, always with great success. I was pleased with the presentation and the quality of the sound. The only real problem I had was that I did not like the way the CD was presented on the player. The CD was turned to face the player and the track names were not legible. I also had the problem that the CD was not the same size as the CD-RW. This was in no way a quality product. It would not have been worth the money if it were not worth the money.

Amazon review: I have listened to this and found the sound quality to be quite good. I was surprised by the amount of high quality vocals. The background music is also very well done. There are several songs that are very well done. I found the lyrics to be quite good as well. I must say that the tracks are a little inconsistent. I am not sure if this is the fault of the producer or the artist. I will be listening to this album more in the future.

###
Amazon review: This is an excellent cd. I have no problem with the music. I have a problem with the choice of songs. The songs on this cd are good, but there is not one that is outstanding. I would suggest that the producer find a way to balance the songs. I would like to be able to hear 3 or 4 songs that are great. I am a big fan of the Mayle Brothers. They are great musicians and I am a big fan of their music. I was disappointed that they did not choose one song to represent each of the generations. I would have liked to hear a song that represented the 50's, the 60's, the 70's, and the 80's. I really enjoyed the music on this cd. I am not sure why the cd was sent to me, but I would like to think that it is the same cd that I received. I have to give this cd a rating of 7 out of 10.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say, I really enjoy this cd. I have bought several albums by the same artists over the last few years, and they have all been great, but never anything like "The Mayle Brothers Collection." I love the songs and the musicianship. I have to say, I do not know why the producers do not use these songs more often. They are really good, and I would like to see them used more often. If they would only use more songs from the same artist, i would be very happy. I am sure I will like this cd again, but I will not listen to it with the same enthusiasm, since I have heard so many great cd's.

Amazon review: I have a CD of the Mayle Brothers and their music, but I have no intentions of purchasing anything else from them. I think their cd's are very good, but not great. This particular cd is a great cd, with some wonderful songs, but I have to say that I don't much care for the lyrics to a few songs. I love the music, I just don't like the lyrics.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to the band for years, but in the last several years they've become one of my favorites, and I've been listening to them more than I used to.  The songs sound great, and their energy is what I like about them.  The album is well produced, the guitars sound great, and the vocals are strong.  I guess it's the usual: I like what I like, so I'll keep listening.

Amazon review: I have a serious problem with rap: I don't like it, and I don't listen to it, and I don't listen to it when I'm driving or it's late at night.  I don't think it's a good thing for the culture, and while I do like it a lot, I don't like it very much.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of these "new" artists who've never been popular.  Sometimes it seems like the best way to deal with them is to pretend they're not there.  They're really good at pretending, though, so it's hard to take them seriously.  I like the song a lot, and the performance is good, but I've never liked "The Hitz" on that album.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  I'm not surprised that the song was released by the band, though.  I think there are two problems.  First, the song is not really about cars (at least not how I understood it), and second, the song is not really about "New York".  It talks about New York and the problems being in New York, but it's not about New York in the way that the song is about New York.  I'm not sure how well the song will go over in another market, though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's hard for me to write a review of a band that I've only heard one song off of.  I don't think that's a bad thing, as there's only one song I've heard from them, and it's really good.  The rest of the album is good, but I'm not very familiar with their music, so it's hard to say which songs are worth listening to.  I think this album is good, but it is the only album I've heard from them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've had a problem with albums with heavy use of sampled music from other bands.  I don't know if it's just a thing with me, but it seems like it gets really annoying listening to them.  I like this album a lot, and I think it would be good to hear more from the band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to this band since I heard them on the radio in the early '80s.  I think they are one of the best bands of that time period.  I haven't heard a lot of their music, and I've been listening to them since I was in 3rd grade, but I think that's a good thing.  This album is great.  Very good.  They're a band that I always enjoy, and I don't think I'll ever have a problem with them again.

Amazon review: I'm going to start a series that will highlight a band I've listened to for years.  It's a good way to get my thoughts together when I'm writing a review.  I'm not one that can write very long, and I have a hard time writing very short.  But I'm going to try.  I'm going to start with the band that I listen to every day: The Tear Garden.  I first listened to their album, "Haven," in 5th grade, and I'm still listening to it.  I've been a fan of theirs for years, but it's hard to get a good album, so I like their older stuff as much as I can (even though I listen to their new stuff more than I listen to their old stuff).
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I listen to a lot of folk music, ranging from bluegrass to folk rock; but, I only listen to this band, and I have almost all their albums.  Their songs are great, and I love the way they have written songs, making each one unique.  I just wish they had more singles, but, I guess that's what you get when you only have one album.  It's also a beautiful album.  I just wish they would put out an album with a couple of nice songs.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: this is the only album that I would ever buy.  There are a few songs that work, a few songs that don't, and then a couple of tracks that are just plain bad, but overall it's excellent.  John Lennon was a genius, a genius musician, and a man who did more for society than just about anyone, ever.  I know that music can be used in a lot of different ways, but if you are not really into it then it's a waste of your money.  This album is great.  I'm glad that I bought this, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to purchase this album.  The only drawback is that I wish I could have bought it earlier.  John Lennon is one of the greats and I was lucky enough to be able to listen to him while I was growing up.  He taught me so much about life, in such a simple yet profound way.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: a really good album.  My brother was a fan too and he gave me this album.  It was his first and he has liked every album ever since.  I have listened to all of them and I enjoyed them all.  I think it is the only album that I will ever buy.  I don't know why.  I don't like music at all.  I don't like songs with words in them.  I don't like songs with singers.  I don't like music that is not very loud.  I don't like music that is not very repetitive (such as when you listen to the same song over and over).  I don't like music that is not very fast.  I don't like music that is not very loud.  All I want to listen to is the John Lennon songs, like he did on this album.  I'm not very computer savvy so I usually buy music through the internet.  That way I have to buy a CD, and then I have to listen to it, and then I have to listen to it again.  I don't like it that way.  I like it the way I like it.  I like music that is very loud.  I like music that is very repetitive.  I like music that is very fast.  It's just the way I like it.

I'm not sure how to put my review here, as it doesn't really matter.  I don't like music that is not very loud.  Some songs are very loud, but I don't like loud music.

Amazon review: the only reason I ever bought this album was for the cover.  Now, I'm not one of those people who would really care if someone gave me something to listen to, but I do like it when I can just look at the cover and say "Hey, it's John Lennon".  That's it.  The music is okay.  Not great, but okay.  The lyrics are okay.  Not great, but okay.  The subject matter is okay.  Not great, but okay.  The subject matter is the only reason why I bought this album.  I'm not one of those people who would really care if someone gave him something to listen to.  Some people do.  I wouldn't.  I like John Lennon so much that I just wanted to listen to him.  I'm not a John Lennon fanatic.  I don't know why I bought it, but I did.  I like him so much.  I just wanted to hear him.  I guess that's why I bought it.  Anyway, I don't really know why I liked it.  I don't really know what I was looking for in a John Lennon album, but I guess I liked it.  I guess I liked it because it was John Lennon.  That's it.  That's all.  I don't really know why I bought it.  I guess I bought it because of the cover.  I guess that's why I bought it.  That's all.  I don't really know why.

Amazon review: I think that I am a very interesting person, and I love to write about music. I am a huge fan of music, I listen to music all the time, and I am very passionate about certain types of music. I like rock, and I also like country, but I'm a fan of all genres of music. I don't prefer one over the other, I like all of them equally. I don't like pop-rock, I like pop-country, I like pop-rock, and so on. I listen to a lot of music, and I like to share my personal opinion about it. I don't have a problem admitting when I like a certain type of music, but I try to be unbiased, and I try to write about music in a friendly way. I have been writing reviews for about two years now. I have a lot to say about music, so I hope you enjoy reading my reviews.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: The best album of the year
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my brother, who does not share my love for Sousa. I have found that as the years go by, I like the music less and less, but that doesn't mean I don't like it. This is my favorite Sousa album and it is great to listen to in the summertime. It's got a little bit of everything, and as of late, I haven't been listening to more than one song from the album for more than a few hours.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album. I have to say, I've only heard the songs that I knew. I love the songs when they are played by the band, but I don't want to hear them in the same order as they are on the album. So, that's why I have to listen to some that I did not know. I've enjoyed this album, and I wish that it was my favorite Sousa album instead of the one that came out this past week.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: This is a great song for me. The first time I heard it I thought it was a bad song because I thought it was too slow and I didn't like the lyrics (and I'm still not sure how I feel about it). When I heard it again after a few days, I thought it was a great song. Great for singing and the lyrics are great. I love the chorus...but I don't know that it is the best for dancing. But it is very well played by a great band.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for a couple of weeks now. It is a good CD. It is a little hard to listen to on this small CD player, but this is the sound I have been wanting to hear. I like the vocals a lot and I like the background sound a lot.  It is nice to have music that is not the same every time.  I am glad to have this CD.

These are the only three CDs that are available on this label and they are well worth the money.  They are good quality, very well produced and have a good sound, but they are not as good as the other records.  I would recommend these three CDs to anyone who enjoys music.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: This CD is very underrated.  I love the way the song "For Those Who Wait" is sung.  And the song "Hymn" is a nice addition.  I love how the album is done.  I like the "Good Time" CD even more.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it is.  I am a big fan of this band.

Amazon review: I love it!  It's absolutely beautiful!  This is the best album I've ever heard.  The only negative I have is the fact that I'm sure there is a better version of this song.  I would like to point out that I've been a big fan of this band since I first heard "Back in the Day" on a cassette tape.  I was so happy when I found this CD a couple of months ago.  It's so good! The first time I had heard "Back in the Day" was when I was 14 and I heard it on a cassette tape at a friend's house.  I have to admit that I thought it was a big mistake to put a cassette tape in a CD player, but he kept playing it over and over again to get us to listen to it.  I heard the song for the first time on a cassette tape (for the first time ever, in fact) and I was shocked when he played it.  I was 15 at the time, and I was absolutely amazed that I had actually heard this song.  I am a huge fan.  He started playing it again after I got home and I told him how impressed I was.  He was so happy about it, and played it for me over and over again.  He played it for a long time and I was so happy that I had heard it right away. I was so happy that I had found this CD.
