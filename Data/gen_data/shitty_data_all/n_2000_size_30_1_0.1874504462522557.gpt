Amazon review: I have given a few copies of the CD and Guide to family and friends because it brings one closer to the Blessed Mother and in touch with the Lord.  I listen to it driving, working out or when I feel I need to quiet myself. Susan has really done a great job with this and it is worth the purchase.

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.

Amazon review:. but this is a poorly produced CD. Both the computer-enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solos, and the overuse of vibrato in the solos make this a definite disappointment.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Jon Anderson (but I am a big fan of his voice).  I think that, because of his voice, I need to hear something new from him.  This is a very good album, however, and I would recommend it.  Unfortunately, it is not what I was expecting.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It has a very unique sound, which is very different from the usual mainstream pop/rock.  The songs have a sense of humor that I really like.  The production is very good (maybe the best I've heard so far).  I love the fact that this was produced by Jon Anderson, who I think is one of the best singers to come along in a long time.  I would highly recommend this album.

Amazon review: I think that this CD is one of the best of this year.  The vocals are really very good.  The album is beautifully produced, too, and it has great cover art.  I was very surprised to hear that the album was produced by Jon Anderson, after hearing about how great he was when he was a session musician.  I think that he is one of the best singers to come along in a long time, and I think that this album is a great representation of his talents.

Amazon review: I bought this album on a whim.  I was really surprised to hear that it was Jon Anderson producing this album.  I thought it was a bad idea to buy it, but I think that it is a great album.  The album is very well constructed, and it has some of the best vocals in the last year.  I think that it is a great representation of Jon's talent.  The music is a little hard on the ears at first, but after awhile you get used to it.

Amazon review: While, at 99 cents, the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances, buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the Messiah by the Bach Collegium Japan is butchered rather badly:  it is drastically (and clumsily cut).  We get the soprano's recitative "There were shepherds abiding in the field," but not the marvelous aria that follows.  And "His Yoke is Easy, His Burden is Light,"  along with "He Shall Feed his Flock" is also missing.

Every song on one is on the other in the exact order. and I bought both thinking they'd be different.  Really disappointed that I bought the same CD twice with separate TITLES.  Great performer. probably a decent guy.  But let's take one of those off the market!  It makes this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or "sneaky".

I don't know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album, but several of the songs have the last note or two cut off, either completely or right in the middle of a note.  Not a lot of joy there.  I will say that there are some songs on the album that are fine, but getting slammed like that really ruins everything.  I'll probably go through the album again and remove these songs from my device.

I really enjoyed the album, but I don't think it's as good as King Los.  I don't know why he's so popular.  I would have said King Los was amazing and King Los are the greatest reggae artist's ever.  King Los is one of my favorite reggae artist's.  I will say this, King Los is my favorite Rasta's.

Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length.

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre.

I'm going to tell you a story about a girl I know

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson.

We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

The Best of the Best

I'm just going to get off the subject of this entire album and get right into what I think is the best song on the album.

The song that I think is the best is "I'm Still Waiting".

I really enjoyed this song, it's one of my all time favorites, and it has an amazing and unforgettable lyric.

The lyric goes something like "I'm still waiting in the sky, and I can't get up there yet."

This song reminds me of the feeling of waiting for something to happen. Waiting for something to happen is a very powerful and amazing feeling.

The song makes me think of a person who is waiting for something to happen. They are waiting for something to happen. I think that this song describes a relationship very well.

"I feel like I'm in a long lost movie"

The song reminded me of a movie that I have never seen. It makes me think of a movie that I have never seen. I think that this song describes a relationship very well.

The song reminds me of a person who is waiting for something to happen. They are waiting. They are waiting for something to happen. I think that this song is about waiting for something to happen.

The song reminds me of a person who is waiting in the sky, and can't get up there yet. I think that this person is waiting for the time to come, and can't get up there yet.

"I'm still waiting in the sky, and I can't get up yet"

This song reminds me of a person who is waiting, and can't get up there yet. They are all waiting for something to happen. The song makes me think of a person who is waiting in the sky, and can't get there yet. I think that this song describes a person who is waiting for something to happen.

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I did not like this CD.  I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

Amazon review: I can't seem to get into this.  At first I thought it was okay but after a couple of listens I was not satisfied.  The lyrics were good (although a little too simple and too vague), but the singing was atrocious...but then I realize that the vocal performance is the problem.  I have no idea what I'm listening to, but I'm listening to a lot of bands from the 80's like Fleetwood Mac...and this is the first Fleetwood Mac CD that I have listened to, so it's not like I'm a huge fan.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.  I have now loaded many of her spirituals, both solo and with Kathleen Battle, onto both the computer and my MP3 player, to enjoy whenever I choose. Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.

Amazon review: Another solid song from the new Skillet album that showcases their softer side. While this is not nearly the side if Skillet I often listen to, it is good enough in its own right.  Rating: 4

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this CD as I already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it. It arrived soon enough, however when I listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the CD. This is really disappointing. I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it. The songs aren't as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to  have one track list on the CD and another on the CD cover.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: Another good disc that I have been waiting for.  In my opinion this is one of the better releases this year.  It is a great addition to my Dylan collection.  It is a very good mix.  It is not as good as the other releases but it does have some good songs. I wish it was a bit softer but not bad.  I think that is one of the reasons why it is getting more listens than the others.  But it does have some good songs.  Overall I think this is a great release.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a Dylan release.

Amazon review: This is the best Dylan album I have ever heard.  All the songs are great. I love the way it was mixed.  The sound quality is great.  The only bad thing about is the fact that there is no CD cover.  It would have been nice to have the album cover on the CD.  But overall I am very pleased with this release.  It is a must have!  It is the best CD I have ever heard from Dylan.  I have listened to every Dylan release I have ever owned.  I have never listened to anything that has been released since he had been out of the spotlight.  I have been waiting for a Dylan release for over a decade.  The wait has been worth it.  I have been listening to this album over and over again.  So far this is the best CD I have ever heard from him.  I have listened to a lot of different music over the past few years.  I have listened to the new Fleetwood Mac, the new Bruce Springsteen, the new R.E.M, the new Tom Petty, the new Rush and the new Aerosmith.  I have listened to them all!  This is the best CD I have ever heard from Dylan.  The only way I can describe it is it has the sound quality of  the master tape.  It has the sound quality of a master tape with the sound quality of one of his masters.  If I could give this album a perfect rating it would be a 10.  Its a great album.

An amazing album, all the tracks are really really good but the last song does not have any words. I had never heard of this band before this album but I listen to a lot of country music and they sound amazingly like Stryper. I think the guy who made this band is a genius.

I bought this album a few days ago and I must say, this

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas. Is it just me, or do the selections this year seem kind of lousy thus far? I really enjoyed this 25 days of free downloads advent-type "calendar" last year.

I have just finished listening to this album and I have to say that it is quite possibly the most original and enjoyable album I have ever listened to. Not only did I enjoy the album, I also liked it because it has so much variety. There is a great variety of styles and genres of music. I was not aware of many groups that combined these styles and genres. I've heard a lot of music but have only listened to a few groups. The only groups I've heard that do this are the Beatles and Genesis. This album is really cool and I've enjoyed every song. I have yet to be disappointed with the quality of a record. This is the best group I've heard so far this year. I really do love this album. The songs are so different and unique. I don't like to compare but I will say they are way better than anything else.

These guys are amazing. This album is a must have for any fan of classic rock. They are very original too. I think all four of these songs are very good. They are very creative and original. These guys are really good.

This is a very good introduction to Celtic Frost. Some of the songs are good, but I'm not sure if it's a good album or not. It's very good, but it's not a great album. It's very dark and very powerful. It's very dark and very powerful, but it's not a great album. It's very dark and it's very powerful, but it's not a great album.

I didn't like some of the songs, but overall this album still is good.

This is good. My favorite song on the album is "All Your Fault", but I like them all. The album is very dark and very powerful. The song "Revelation" was a little bit disappointing. I don't know if it's because of the vocals, but after listening to it I just thought it sounded like the vocals were the same for the entire song. But I still like it. I like the album a lot.

This is a very good album. This album is awesome. This album is awesome!!!

I have just finished listening to this album and I have to tell you that the vocals are amazing. These guys are really good. They even managed to add a little new twist to the traditional Celtic Frost sound. I don't know, I'm really impressed by this band. I will definitely listen to some other albums.

Amazon review: This is an amazing live album.  The vocals are great.  This is the best Metallica live album I have ever heard.  It reminds me of the concerts of the 80s.  I wish they made a DVD of these concerts.  This album is a must buy for all Metallica fans.

A band known for their raw-throated riffs, their dynamic live performances-and their propensity for the occasional metal-chilead. You've got to hand it to these guys. While they were already a well-known band, they've come a long way since then. They're only recently (in my memory) getting the attention of many metal fans. Their newest album, Master of Puppets, is a great album and I highly recommend it. They're just an awesome live band.

For anyone who's never heard of them, Metallica - if you're a true metal head- is one of the best rock bands and probably one of the best heavy metal bands. They're best known for the "metallica" sound, both the heavy and the clean version, but they also have a couple of other styles. Metallica is the first metal band I ever heard, and I was instantly hooked. The riffs, the songs, they have a lot of fun with. I have seen them in concert about 8 times and I never get tired of their songs. They have the best music I ever heard. I had the chance to see them live once and I was amazed with the amount of energy they have in their shows and that's where the real metal is. I was lucky enough to attend their "The Last Tour", a massive 3 hour long concert held in front of 6,000 people and I was there for it. They played the most amazing "metal" I've ever heard and it was an awesome experience.

I can only speak for my personal opinion, but I think Metallica is awesome. They are a great live band and one of the best metal bands in the world. They're not "one of the best" though. I think they are one of the most underrated metal bands and sometimes I don't even know what their best songs are. I don't think they're a "big" metal band either. I think they're "big" in the sense that they're a "big" live band, but they're not really "big" in the sense of "big". They are a good metal band, but their "big" songs are more like "big" in the sense that they're good melodic songs.

The Master of Puppets is a great album. I'm glad they took some time out of their busy schedule to record it. The album really shows how they've grown as musicians and performers. The production and the mixing is fantastic. The production is top notch and it really shows how Metallica has grown as a band. They're always delivering great shows and they've become a popular live band. It's great to see that they are still as creative and passionate (and passionate about their music) as ever. They're more than just a live band for me and I recommend this album to anyone who likes great metal music.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: Since I grew up in an extremely remote part of Alaska, I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't very exposed to the Bee Gees' music in the Seventies. I was only familiar with "Lonely Nights" from a mix album of my parents and I had no idea who the artists were. In my twenties I ventured out into the world and heard "Stayin' Alive" and other disco hits without really paying much attention. In my thirties I had dinner at my parents' house and afterwards they watched an A&E special concert promoting the Bee Gees album, "This is Where I Came In.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

Never had the chance to see the original lineup, but I've seen a few shows by current members and a few by the original lineup. So far, it appears to me as if they are still playing, but they aren't doing it the same way as they did 30 years ago. So, is it the same band with the same songs? Probably not.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.
