Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I recently found out about this band and was really excited about checking it out, but I never got around to it. I don't know why, I think I was more interested in this band than I was in Revel.  I wasn't disappointed with the album at all, it is as good as I expected.  Not too much material.  If you can't stand the thought of bluegrass then this would be an awesome choice.

Amazon review: I had read lots of reviews on this, but I was not too impressed with the first cd.  And after hearing it, I realized why.  It was too much of the same.  I don't care how good the songs are, they are just not very enjoyable for me.  I wish that they would do a second cd and at least bring in a few new songs to add to the mix.  I would also like to see just a little more diversity on the instrumentation.  It was really hard to get into the music.  I wish that they would make a second cd.  I am glad I found this band, they are going to be something.

Amazon review: I don't think this CD is very good, and I am even a little disappointed with the first cd.  I can't believe that I paid $15 for the cd.

Amazon review: I'm not much a fan of bluegrass or anything else that has to do with bluegrass, but I enjoy this band.  They are very good.  I think it would be great to have them in a bluegrass or country band, but they've got a pretty good sound on their own.  This cd is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to get into country and folk music, and would be a good substitute for a Bluegrass band who doesn't play on the new CD.

Amazon review: This group is not bad, there are some good songs but also a few bad ones.  The cd is very good, and is worth checking out if you are interested in this type of music.

I wouldn't have it on constant rotation in my car if it weren't for another cd that I listen to so I can listen to this cd all the time.  It is a good cd and worth checking out.

I have bought the cd's for my nephew and daughter, and they are a very good buy.  I have also purchased the cd's for my friends, and they are a great purchase.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I have a few different songs that I will share with you. I am new to the internet radio and I have been listening to them for a few weeks. I have to admit that I am a bit of a music snob. I listen to many different styles of music. I like the different styles that are out there. I used to be a singer for a very famous church choir. I know how to sing, but am not very good at it. I have had some musical experience, but not to the degree I would like. I have been singing for 30 years, but I have never met anyone that could sing like I can. I am not a big fan of country music like some of you. I have a couple of favorites. I am a Christian and I have heard several songs that have great meaning. I have enjoyed listening to this album. I have not had the opportunity to sing with the band, but I am sure they are great. I am sure they will be a great team. I love the CD. I have also been listening to my internet radio from time to time. Some of you may have noticed that it is not very loud. I have found that it is a great way to listen to music while doing other things. I have found that the more I listen to more different artists, the more I enjoy it. I am looking forward to using this cd. I know that I will enjoy it. I am only a few CDs away from finishing this album. I have no idea which songs are which. I will have to listen to them all to figure that out. I am looking forward to it. I am sure that all of the songs will have great meaning for the listener. I am looking forward to it. I have been looking forward to my birthday for a long time. I will be going to see the musical. I hope that I can do my best. I hope to be able to meet all of you.

#  The Complete David Bowie

"The Complete David Bowie" is a CD compendium by rock journalist and author Ian MacDonald. The album compiles David Bowie's entire solo career, and is divided into chapters based on the various albums he has released.
This is the first of three volumes to be released in the series, with "The Complete David Bowie" the second. It was released on November 17, 1996.

Amazon review: "From the very first time I heard this album, I could not believe it.  The music is fantastic, the lyrics are great, and Bowie's voice is flawless.  He is an amazing artist.  I have not been able to listen to this album all the way through, as I bought it as a single.  I am looking forward to re-entering the world of Bowie.

Amazon review: "I love The Complete David Bowie.  It contains all of his solo work and it is a very good one.  There is so much quality music here it's hard to pick the top 5 or 6 songs, but I recommend going back and listening to all the albums in the order they were released."

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked this cd.  I listened to it about 1/3 of the way through,  then put it away.  I did like it,  but I will not buy any of their other CDs.  The cd's I have bought from them have always been  well done,  but I have found the cd's from this company to be  really mediocre.  I will not buy their albums. I have only bought two of their cd's,  so I can't say  anything from them about their cd's.

I bought a cd from them but they are just the same cd over and over.  I am done with them cds.  There are other cd's that are better than this.  These cds are worse than the ones I have heard.  I like this cd.  They are worth the money.  I will buy the cd's that I have heard.

Amazon review: The cd's are decent,  the songs are not.  I have listened to the cd's that they have put out but I have never bought a cd from them.  They are a good band,  but not worth the money.  If you want a cd to listen to,  look at their cd's but don't buy one.  I have seen this band play many times at the gym.  I have seen them play at church plays.  I have seen them play at a lot of concerts.  I have seen them at shows at the lake.  I have seen them at the mall.  They have played shows that are worth buying tickets for.  The cd's I have bought  are the same ones over and over.  When it comes to the music,  there are many bands that have a better cd.  I have never heard anything from them.  They are worth listening to.  Some of the best cd's I have ever heard.  The cd's I have heard from them have been better than this one.  They are worth the money.  The cd's are only a dollar and a half at the dollar spot.  This cd is about the life of Jesus and I like it.  I like the songs that are on this cd.  I have heard the songs that are on this cd before.  They are worth the money.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was a little bored and wanted a few new songs to listen to. I really like most of the songs, except I could not get past the first song, "Let the Worshipers Arise." Is anyone else with me, I mean I have to hear this song over and over again. It's just so beautiful, but as soon as I listen to it, I want to turn the music off. I did not expect this album to be so hard to listen to. Maybe I'm just a little picky, and it's just not for me.

Amazon review: This album has a lot of good songs, but I really can't stand the first song, "Let the Worshipers Arise."

Amazon review: This album is awesome, and it is easy to listen to. The CD is almost a full length album in itself. The only reason I couldn't give this album five stars is because the songs seem to be one-sided. I enjoyed myself with the songs that were written for worship, because they were in the main focus of the songs. That's why there is a song called "My God Is a Rock" and another song called "This Is My Name." Both of those songs are about God as a rock and a stone. My favorite song is "Jesus Is My Salvation." There are also some songs that you may not have heard before, but they are not completely new songs. "He Makes Me Feel So Good" and "I Can Hear Him" are both songs that I already knew about, but it was nice to hear them again. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to worship music, but if you are a die hard evangelical Christian, then you probably wouldn't enjoy the songs that are not specifically about songs of salvation.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really don't know why I bought this album. I have just come from a Christian prayer group meeting, and I was surprised at how they talked about this album. It seems to be very much a product of the '90s. I have read everything I could find about it online, and I can't find the good points. I don't like that song on the CD, "In Your Mind," because it sounds very much like the song, "He's Got the Whole World" by Rascal Flatts.

Amazon review: Just when you think you have listened to all of the songs on this album, you will be taken to another site where you have to listen to the song "For the Glory of God."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I have listened to this song over and over again and I still can't figure out how it was finished. The songs on this CD are of a high quality and the vocals are very clear.

There is a little bit of everything on this album, but it is all underwhelming.  The majority of the songs have the same four chord progression and the lyrics are just plain annoying.  The only song I didn't like was "Sugar", but that song is only two minutes long and I can live with that.  The song "Duck Duck Goose" is just plain boring, and I think the song "Honey, Honey, Honey" is the worst song on the album.  All in all, I am not impressed.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say.  He sounds like a robot.  It sounds like I am hearing someone's voice.  The words don't mean anything!  I don't know what to say.  I don't know why he sings like a baby.  I don't like the song at all.  It's very boring.  I think he is just a robot.  He just sings like a computer.

Amazon review "Love at the End of the Day" is a really good song.  I can't believe this guy is on the radio.  He is not good at all.  He is so bad.  He doesn't have a decent voice at all.  He is terrible.  I don't understand how

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Not one of the best, but one of the worst albums that I have ever heard.  There is nothing that stands out about this album and the songs are so overplayed it almost makes it a waste of money,  even though it's only $.99 a piece.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life.  I've never seen a girl or man that can sing worse than this.  I love the guitar and the backing vocals, but the vocals are completely lacking and I won't listen to this song more than once,  even when it's on the radio.

Amazon review: I have heard many of the songs on this album but I have never heard a song like this.  It's so bad its good.  It's like listening to a bad version of The Who.   You know the one where they don't know what to play, but they keep going anyway.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

If you have not listened to their albums, I urge you to start with Toto and only then listen to this.  The songs are excellent, especially the ones about love, the "Love Song" and "I Love You" are so moving that I felt I needed to cry. If you are a fan of these songs, you will love this. If you haven't heard Toto, this is a must have.

Amazon review: It's a simple pop song. It doesn't have great lyrics and the chorus is repeated a few times. The best thing about it is that it's catchy. There are a lot of songs with catchy chorus, but this one is different because you can sing the chorus to it, but it just doesn't work for me.  I like that the song is pop, but it's not the best pop that I have heard.  I don't know why this is a pop song and not a dance song.  I'm going out on a limb by saying, "No one has to dance to this song." It's just a song, but the lyrics are so touching that I think it will get the job done.

Amazon review: I had to listen to this song more than once to make sure I was liking it.  This is one of those songs that you will just love. The song is a mixture of pop/rock, with beautiful harmony vocals that make it a little different from other songs that have this type of singing.  There is nothing else like this on the radio, so I recommend you check this out.  It's also a lot better than the radio version.  The lyrics are great, and the melody and arrangement of the song are amazing.  I would give this a five star rating if I could rating it like a normal song.

I didn't think that it was a terrible song, but I think that it would have been better if the song had a more powerful voice.  It's a good song, but I would not reccomend it.

I did not think he could produce so many instruments live.  I am also disappointed with the "sound quality", the music is very muddy and the vocals are not clear.  I believe that the music on this record is so raw it took a lot of mastering to bring out the true sound.  The instruments sound like they are just laying on the floor.

It's just a silly song.  And there is a lot of "muck" in this record.  I don't think I can even go through the entire album and figure some of the songs out.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Bryan Adams

by Tazewell H.

This is really a great album. Not only is it great song selection it has a lot of really good songs. If you're looking for a cool album not to be missed check it out.

I have been listening to this CD for about a month now and I am still finding new and exciting things to listen to.
This CD is well worth it and I can't wait to listen to the rest of it.

Bryan Adams

by Tazewell H. and Bryan A.

Bryan Adams is one of the most creative and prolific songwriters of the last 50 years. I've listened to his albums since the first one I bought in 1971 and they never fail to surprise me with the creativity, the lyrics, and the melodies on this album. If you're a fan of "American Idol", "The Voice", "Glee", or any of his other musical projects this album is well worth buying for the songs alone but it's the cover by none other than Bryan Adams himself that is truly the best.

Bryan Adams is a very talented artist and this album is an excellent example of his genius. If you're a fan of "American Idol", "The Voice," "Glee", "Dancing With the Stars", "American Idol: The Champions", or any of his other musical projects you will enjoy this album.

by Steven B.

I have been hearing this CD for a long time and yet I didn't really find out about it until my brother sent me one of his CD's for Christmas. I had no idea Bryan Adams was so talented. He writes amazing songs, the lyrics are amazing, and the music is great. He is a real talent. I had no idea that he was so talented until I heard his music.

I love this album. It has everything you could want in a great CD. I love the music. It is fun and energetic. I love the lyrics. I love the variety in the music selections. The only thing that I don't like about the album is that it does not have a CD booklet, that is a small downside for me.

Bryan Adams is a talented artist and author. This album is a great one. I have been listening for a long time and I still find new and exciting things to listen to. I have to give my brother credit for sending me this album for Christmas and I love it. I have to admit that this is my first time hearing this album. It is a great one.

This is a great album. I don't listen to much classical music; most of the time I like to listen to rock and other music genres. This album does not have as many great songs as most of the others I listen to, but it is still a great album.

Bryan Adams has written some of the greatest songs of all time. Not only were the lyrics great but the music is great, too. I've been listening to this album for a while and I've been enjoying it. I've really enjoyed learning about him since I saw

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
