Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I must state that I am not a reviewer for this particular album or any other music item. I am simply someone who loves this type of music, and who often finds it hard to find a CD that is worth buying. And who likes to be surprised by how much of a sucker I can be for a CD that I already know is going to leave me wanting more. And who loves to be able to say, "I told you so" when it comes to the music that I am listening to. Now, I did not like this CD, and I still do not like this CD. I never liked much of Deftones, and I hope that more people do not like this CD. And if Deftones ever does anything like this again, I hope they do not have a song called "I'm Not Going to Rehab."

This is a pretty good rock song but the vocals are almost non-existent. It also is a pretty boring song. There is no originality here. I could listen to this all day. I wish the guitarists would have picked up some harmonies. The lyrics are stupid. They talk about "the time when everything was the same" (which is never actually said in the song) and the main guy thinks he is a bad person for not going to a bar with his friend. He only wants to go because he is bored. The main guy should not have spent so much time on this song. It is a pretty cool song but the vocals are almost non-existent. It also is a very boring song. I wish the guitarists would have picked up some harmonies. So, what do you guys think?

Amazon review: This is my favorite album of the year.  It's just a perfect sound that I haven't heard before.  It's not as much of a journey as the first season of the show, but it has a lot of great tracks.  I'm excited to see what they do next.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I give this album a 5 out of 5 stars. This is the album that I have been looking forward to for the longest time, and I am so glad that I finally got my hands on it. The album is full of really good songs, with a good variety of styles from all eras. I don't know who was more surprised by the album, Rob Zombie or myself. I really didn't expect the album to sound like that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was surprised by how good this album is. I thought I would love it, but it actually is awesome. The production is quite a bit better than on the previous album, and the songs sound better. I'm definitely going to check out another album by Rob Zombie.

Amazon review: This is a great album, and I love the way that the songs are structured. I love the combination of the acoustic and the electric guitar, and the different styles are well-balanced. The tracks range from slow-paced ballads to fast paced rockers, and everything is excellent.

Amazon review: This album is a great listen. I love the variety in styles and the creativity. I really enjoyed the whole album and the songs are just so good. The guitar and the vocals work really well together, and the album is well done. Rob Zombie is a very talented musician, and I can't wait for his next album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the second of two great Rob Zombie albums, and I could listen to them both over and over again. The album is great, but I think the reason that I loved the other album so much was that it was more of a rock album, while this is a really nice blend of different styles.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Rob Zombie has been on the radio for a long time and hasn't failed you yet.  This album is no different.  It's all about the music and the songs that he wrote. I like that he can write on the guitar and also on the piano. It's really a nice sound that fits the songs perfectly.  Every song is on it's own, and there is a lot of variety in the styles of music. This album is worth checking out.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.
