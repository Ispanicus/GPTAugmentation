Amazon review: Im not sure if I like it or not - I finally listened to it by having my car record it to its harddrive and I have the wrong CD it is Jeremy Camp with the following 5 songs:  Trust in You, Enough, Empty Me, I Wait for the Lord and Revive Me.  NOT EVEN THE CHAINSMOKERS. WEIRD.  the CD case and the artwork on the CD are all Chainsmokers: Bouquet.  NONE of the music is Chainsmokers. AGAIN WEIRD!

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre. The others are fairly consistent with BWB's usual work. I'm not sure what intent for that was, but the next album needs to be smooth jazz through and through, not this.

Amazon review: I was eagerly looking forward to this CD after watching Hollie on Britain's Got Talent on YouTube.  When I first played it I thought something had gone wrong with my sound system.  After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

This song reminds me of a book I read years ago called, "How to Live With Your Parents".  It's about a guy who can't even live with his parents.  At the end of the book, the guy says, "I am so not going to live with my parents".  To me, this song is about that.   Sorry, if you were hoping for a good song on this album, you got one instead.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

The mix sounds like an older 78, but I guess that is not surprising because it is from a stereo recording. The mix is not perfect, but it does not sound like stereo on the recording. The album is worth listening to, and I believe that the album would be much better without the overdubs. The songs are all good, but some of the songs are a bit overplayed. This album is good for people who like the 60s and 70s.

If you love great relaxing piano music along the lines of George Winston or Jim Brickman, you are in for a real treat. I have never been disappointed in this artist's offerings.  Listen to the tracks and find out for yourself, what you've been missing. And then get PASSIONS!

Amazon review: Great music obviously, but awful remastering - even worse than the 3CD Chrome Box. Sounds thin and tinny, like it's coming out of a transistor radio. The mighty Chrome deserve better, but they'll never get it as long as they're on Cleopatra.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This sounds like a great CD but I don't know if it's worth the $50 price tag. The sound is beautiful, I've heard it performed at the Philharmonic, but I'd expect a better sound and maybe the CD as a whole would be a little bit better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not a bad recording, but I don't know how I'd listen to it. I would expect a better recording and maybe some more depth to the sound.

###
Amazon review: For my money, I've got to give it credit for how it sounded, but I wouldn't buy this. If you're considering the Passions series, you might as well buy the "Chrome" series. The sound quality is good, the music is good, the remastering is good, and the price is right. I haven't heard a single negative comment.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album several times and was impressed with the quality. I would probably buy this CD again, if only to buy a copy of the remastered CD. It is a fine album, but not as good as the Chrome series. If you like Chrome, this is not going to be a problem.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to the CD of this album; however, I have listened to other music CDs in the Chrome series and I have not been disappointed. The same is true for many of the other CD's in the Chrome series. In conclusion, I would recommend this CD to those who like the Chrome series.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes the Chrome series. I have found the sound quality to be excellent and the music to be good. I would love to see this CD on CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD a couple of years ago. It is a fantastic CD, although it's a 3 CD set. The sound quality is very good, especially in the remastered CD.

The Passions album is as brilliant as the Chrome series CD. Great CD, great album, so much better than the Chrome series.

For me, this CD is the best CD I have ever listened to. I have been listening to George Skaroulis since the late 70's, since I first heard his original Piano Concerto No. 2, and then later on his piano Concerto No. 3.  I finally discovered this CD, and I have been in love with it ever since.

The Passions CD is a 3 CD set. It is an excellent CD, and it is definitely worth the money that you pay for it. I have no complaints about the CD, and it is a great CD, one of the best CD's I have ever heard.

The Passions CD is a great CD, a real gem of the modern piano music. If you really want to listen to this type of music, you will probably like it. But if you are a fan of George Skaroulis, you have already got this CD. It is a very good CD, and I recommend it to everyone.

I have listened to this CD several times and I am totally satisfied with the quality of sound, but I'm not impressed with the CD quality. For example, if you listen to the CD in the car, you will hear the CD quality to be tinny, and it sounds as if it's coming out of a transistor radio. I don't know what the CD was like when they were remastering the original CD, but if it was any better they would have remastered it.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Chrome series, because it is better than the Chrome series CD. It is also a very good CD, and I recommend it to everyone, especially to those who love George Skaroulis.

This CD is a very good CD and I would recommend it to anyone who loves this type of music.

The Passions CD is a very good CD, and I recommend it to everyone.

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

I would have to disagree.  I thought the new stuff was enjoyable, but the older stuff was more fun and memorable.  I was actually surprised and happy with the "Blessing" because I thought it was one of the best songs on the album.  I have to give it 4/5 stars because I thought they had made a real effort.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is pretty much a compilation of the band's first two albums.  I don't think I can say I really liked it.  The songs are well played and there are a few good songs on it, but they are so similar that I don't think I really liked it.  I think the band should have stuck with the first two albums and given us something new.

Amazon review:  I've been listening to the Shinedown album for a little over half an hour now and I'm loving it.  I love the way the singing on this album is so different from the singing in the other albums.  Shinedown has such a unique sound to it that I don't think I've heard anything like it in a band this much!  And I am very surprised that I like it so much.  I have to give it 4/5 stars.  It is definitely a good starting point for the Shinedown fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I can't say I was pleased with this album.  I was excited by hearing about the new album and I was excited to get a new Shinedown album to listen to.

Amazon review:  I like the band's new album, but this "Shinedown" CD album is a disappointment.  If I was a die-hard fan of Shinedown, I would have been disappointed with this album.  As a casual fan of Shinedown, I will probably listen to it one more time and then skip it.  I think this album is a poor start for the Shinedown fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album was not a good start for the fans of the band.  I am not a huge fan of the band but I have to give the album a 2 out of 5 stars (the album was great).  I do not feel the new songs will make up for the albums lack.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This band has a lot of talent but unfortunately, they have been unable to keep up with the times.  Some of their music will be good, but the rest of it will not be good.  There is a lot of talent here but they have been unable to put it together.  They are so good at writing great songs that there is no reason to listen to the rest of the albums.  This band needs to get back to their roots and stop writing boring, lame songs.  This band needs to go back to the drawing board.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I bought this album because I have a love-hate relationship with this band.  I absolutely love their first two albums, but their new album was just boring to me.  The new songs were not exciting and they did not come up with any new and fresh ideas to make their music stand out.  The band needs to get back to basics and start writing good songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is good but I don't think it is enough to keep me interested in these guys.  I need to hear something new.  I have been listening to both of their albums and I have to say that I am disappointed with the new album.  I was hoping that it would be better then the previous two albums and it wasn't.  They need to get back to the basics and write good songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this band and I have been wanting to buy this new album for a long time but I never quite felt the urge to buy it until now.  This album is a step in the right direction for the band and I hope they take it to the next level.  I'm a fan of this band and I hope they keep doing great things.  I hope they keep writing great music.  I hope they keep doing great things.  I hope they keep doing great things.  I hope they continue to write great music.  I hope they continue to write great music.  I hope this album is a turning point for this

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review:  This record is the epitome of mediocrity.  Lou Reed is a gifted musician and this is the album that the world needs.

It's a pretty good album.  The songs are all pretty good.  Some of them are really good.

When I was a kid I had dreams of being a singer, a performer, a singer, a singer, a singer, a singer, a singer, a performer, a singer, a singer, a singer...  I went to the music store after school (which was a 3 mile walk) and asked the guy there if they had any old records I could buy.  He said, "You can buy any record you want, but you'll never find a song like this.  It's a song that no one has ever written.  It's a song that no one has ever sung."  I bought it the next day.  I have not seen it since then.  It's been a very long time.  It was the only piece of music that ever made me feel like I had a place, an identity, a voice, a place in the world.

I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.

Amazon review:   "If you are a Beatles fan you should have heard this album. This was their first studio album (and therefore the first album to use the word studio album in its title). Most of the tracks on this album were written and recorded in the studio. This album was released in September 1965 after their first UK tour in the fall of 1964. The first single was "I Saw Her Standing There". It was a hit and was a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and a number 1 hit on the Cash Box Top 100.
The album was also released in September 1965 with a 2nd single, "I Want to Hold Your Hand". This was a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and a number 3 hit on the Cash Box Top 100."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   After "I Saw Her Standing There" the Beatles went into a creative cul de sac. They were struggling to find a way to make good music. They had the song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" on their first album, but it wasn't a hit. They then made "Please Please Me", which was a hit, and then they made "From Me to You", which didn't do well, but then they made "I am the One" which did well and then they made "Yesterday" which did pretty well and then they made "Nowhere Man" which was really good, but it did not do as well as they had hoped.
Then, they decided to get out of the studio and do live recordings. They had been doing the live recordings for several years, but they decided to do some studio recordings.
"I saw Her Standing There" was a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, but they lost a lot of fans when they realized that the single was not very good. They decided to do a second single. They did another single, and then they did "I Want to Hold Your Hand". This single was a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, a number 2 hit on the Cash Box Top 100, and a number 1 hit on the Adult Contemporary Charts. It sold over 500,000 copies.
"I Want to Hold Your Hand" was a number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, a number 3 hit on the Cash Box Top 100, and a number 12 hit on the R&B charts. It sold over 500,000 copies.
"From me to you" was a number 3 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, a number 2 hit on the Cashbox Top 100, and a number 9 hit on the R&B charts. It sold over 500,000   
copies.
"Yesterday" was a number 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, a number 6 hit on the Cash Box Top 100, and a number 17 hit on the R&B charts. It sold over 500,000
copies.
The Beatles were not pleased with their second single, so they decided to get out of the studio and go to England and play their first live performance. They made a live album, and this is their first live album, but they made a second live album called "The Beatles at the BBC". It was recorded in London, England, at the BBC's Empire Pool on December 31, 1964. This album was released on January 7, 1965, and this album was released on June 7, 1965. It contains the songs "I Am the Walrus", "I Am the Walrus", "I Saw Her Standing There",

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review:  My first impression of this album was that it was very good.  It's not that I didn't like it, but this was one of the last albums that I played on a regular basis.

If you haven't heard it yet, I strongly recommend you give it a try.

I've never heard the album in its entirety, but it's from what I've heard it sounds like it could be a great album.  I wish there was a better sound quality.  I bought this CD so I could listen to it on my car stereo, but I can't listen to it on my car stereo.  I can't even listen to it on my computer.  It's just too bad that it sounds so horrible.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is the perfect balance of the band's past and the future.  It has all the elements of the band's best work, but has not been played on a regular basis for over a decade.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes pop-rock/metal with some pop in it.  It is not the most original thing, but I like that it has the elements of the band's best work and still has enough that makes it enjoyable.  It's definitely worth the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: My first impression of this album was good.  I like a lot of the songs on this album. The first song I listened to was "The Battle of Los Angeles" which is one of the heaviest songs on the album.  I liked how the band did a cover of "The Battle of Los Angeles" and "The Battle of Los Angeles" was extremely heavy. The second song I listened to was "You're the Reason" which is one of the slower songs on the album.  However, I really liked the song and would recommend it anyway.  The third song I listened to was "One in a Million" which features the best vocals on the album.  I was a little confused at first because the vocals were so high.  However, after a few listens, the vocals on that song were much better.  There are a few other slower songs on the album, but I didn't really like the slow songs.  Still, they are decent songs.  The fourth song I listened to was "The Light at the End of the Tunnel" which is a really good song.  The fifth song I listened to was "The Light at the End of the Tunnel".  It is one of the slower songs on the album.  I was not a fan of the song until I got to the bridge, and then I really began to enjoy the song.  The last song I listened to was "The Light at the End of the Tunnel", but I was not a big fan of that song until the last few seconds.  I like this album a lot, but I don't think it's the best album Volbeat has ever made.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this album.  It's a good mix of the band's most recent and classic songs.  It has a lot of energy.  I like how every song has a hook or a catch phrase or a catchy chorus.  There is one song I don't like, "The Light at the End of the Tunnel" because it is very slow.  It's also one of the slower songs on the album.  However, I still like it.  I recommend this album to anyone who likes pop-rock/metal with some of the pop in it.  It's a good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know a lot about Volbeat, but after listening to this album I know that I will be buying this band's albums in the future.  There's a lot of great songs on this album.  The band plays a lot of songs from the 1980s, but they also play a lot of songs from the 1990s and 2000s.  This album is the best they have ever made.

Besides the fact, that the encores are really fun and feature some rare tunes. Hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: I gave this a listen.  A friend of mine knows I'm a big fan of Frank, etc, so he thought I'd like this.  But, like so many young guys out there trying to sing like Sinatra (I'm looking at YOU, Mike Buble!), they fail because they have no heart. Now, technically, Seth is a good singer.  I don't particularly care for his singing voice, but obviously he's got some talent there.  I almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover.  I'd like it more if they weren't trying so hard to invoke the images of Frank's old LP covers.

Amazon review:  I'm not sure what to think of this record.  I don't know anyone who buys anything by this man.  But I can't get enough of his music.  I was impressed by his early stuff, but I think he's gotten a little too crazy for me.  I do find some of his albums interesting, though.

Amazon review: There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.

Please, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM OR ANYTHING ELSE BY THIS ARTIST. I guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do.

Amazon review:  I'm a huge fan of Lemmy and all that he does, but this album really did take the piss out of him. I've seen this guy on stage with other bands, and he is funny and charismatic like he always is, but he is not the funny, witty, talented, creative and charismatic artist that he is on stage. When he is on stage, he can make you laugh, but this album... he really let 'em get past him and he just sounded like he was trying to be one of the band members when he wasn't. I am a huge fan of Motorhead, but this album really did sour me on Lemmy. I'm not a huge fan of the band, and this album is not what I would call a classic Motorhead album, but it is an album that could have been made by them at a time when they were really on their way up to the top and getting really good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is no better way to start off a review of a "best of" album than to write a negative review, but... this is not a "best of" at all. This is a "worst of" album, and it's really awful. I think I'm going to go back to my old review of the albums where I just wrote good things.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first time I saw Lemmy, I was just so amazed by his voice!!! He is the best singer in rock n' roll, and the best guitar player too. I have been listening to Lemmy since he was a boy, and he has always been my favorite vocalist. I first heard him on the song "Bad to the Bone" by Iggy Pop. I was only five years old at the time, and I was blown away by his beautiful voice. I was also very impressed with the way he played on that song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Lemmy, Lemmy is an amazing vocalist, he always does so many different styles of playing, and in my opinion, he is one of the best guitar players of all time. He also has been a true inspiration to me. I am also a huge fan of Motorhead, I have seen Lemmy play with other bands, and I think Lemmy is one of the best guitar players in the world. This album is not the best Motorhead album. Motorhead have always been a great band, they have been doing great for a long time. But when I think of Lemmy on stage, I think of the song "I am legion" by Motorhead, and I just can't believe that I have to say this, but this album is not Motorhead.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it is a good album, and I think it is a good way to start the year. The songs don't really stand out, but that's part of the reason I like it. I think it does start the year off with a bang, and I think Lemmy should be proud of that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album, I do think it has a little bit of greatness to it though. Lemmy never disappoints, and I am a huge fan of Motorhead. I think this album is good, and Lemmy should be proud of that.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.
