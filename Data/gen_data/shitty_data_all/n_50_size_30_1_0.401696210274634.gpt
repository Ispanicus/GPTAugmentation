Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Mumford & Sons - The High Road

Amazon review: A good album, but not a great one.  There is good music in this album, but if you love folk music, you are probably not going to be happy with this album.  This is the first time I have heard songs like "The High Road" and "We Are All Made of Stars" and I like them.  This album is very well made.  The lyrics are good, the music is good, and the vocals are

Click "Add Review" button next to this song or album and I will write a review for you.

I've been watching this video for a while now.  I just watched the first part (in the UK) and then I bought this album for my sisters birthday.  She was thrilled and she was waiting for the next part to come out.  I was listening to it with her all day at her house.  She kept asking me for the second part.  Anyway, I had to buy this album!  The songs are great.  The lyrics are a little difficult to understand but I don't mind that.

I know a lot of people are not into this album because it's mostly songs from other artists.  I can understand that, but I love this album.  I am glad I bought it.  The songs are great.  I like the songs from this album better than the ones from other artists.  I can't wait to listen to the second part of the album.  I can't wait!  I am glad I bought it.  I will buy it again.  I can't wait!  I am glad I bought it!  I am glad I bought it!  I am glad I got it!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I bought "When You're Gone" at first I thought I was going to like the song but I was not very pleased with the results. I am not very good at following the lyrics of songs and I didn't like the video. The song is beautiful and it's a simple song that does not require much thought. I really like the song but I don't think I'll like any other Meghan Trainor songs.

I bought the book to read it, but I don't know anything about it, just that it was written and performed by an unknown singer.

I bought the CD to listen to the song, but again, I don't know anything about it, just had a vague idea that it was from the work.

I received an email from Amazon.com today that I have a new item. Now I'm just waiting for the shipping confirmation.

I have to say, the whole experience has been a complete waste of money and time.

Its just too slow for me.  But this song has a lot of meaning for me. Its about how hard it can be to be a single mother and how you just have to fight on your own and be the best that you can be.  I will be looking at this song more now and I will be looking for the next one to add to my playlist.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is a very interesting album, and I really enjoy the variety of styles that they've attempted. There are some very catchy pop songs like "I'm on the Outside" and "Breakdown in 3/4" that don't follow the typical "rock" formula, and I really like the use of the synthesizer. I think the combination of pop-songs and synth-based songs is a very interesting approach to rock music, and I can't wait to hear their next album.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Tis the Season to be Thankful

I've been thinking about how I can make my Thanksgiving dinner a little bit more special. So I'm going to try to cook my own turkey. I usually buy a half-turkey, half-chicken, but since my freezer is nearly empty, I'm going to make a whole turkey and then freeze the breast

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I just bought Jewel's CD, "The Secret". To me, it's just another CD by some generic-sounding singer-songwriter, in a mediocre production company that has no idea of what they're doing. Jewel's voice is lovely and she's got great songs, but I don't like the song selection. I don't like the lyrics. I don't like the album cover. I don't like the songs. But I bought it because I like Jewel. She's a nice lady and I'll buy anything that I like. But I really don't like this CD. Even though she's a great singer, and her songs are nice, the songs aren't my kind of songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I love this song, and I know the lyrics are not a Christian one, but I do love this song.  The voice of the choir is lovely and the choir's vocalizations are great.                (the choir is not really in charge of the music, but simply the vocalization of the music)  I am hoping to hear more of Libera, and to listen to him in his own arrangement, as I think he deserves a better arrangement than the one he has provided with this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great vocal choir.  The choir is a perfect example of the voice of God's people.  I was just thinking to myself as I read the reviews, that this is one of the best vocal choirs I have heard.  The vocal ranges of these boys were stunning.  The lyrics are not really a Christian one, but it is still very pleasing to me and I am very proud to say that I am a Christian.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The singer, L.G. Jones, is a great bluesman, but the production and arrangements are amateurish and not up to the standards of a serious artist.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of The Kingston Trio since I was about 8 years old and started in on albums in the early 60s.  The Trio has been so influential to me, my parents, and my wife.  This is one of the finest live jazz albums I've ever heard.  The album has been a constant in my room and I am truly grateful for it.  I'm not even talking about the quality of the music, I'm talking about the sound on CD.  What I hear on my records today is not even close.  I've tried to explain this to my wife, but she just can't hear it, even though she is in the room.  I am very thankful for this album on CD.

Amazon review: The KingstonTrio.  The Kingston Trio is a hard rock band with soul.  Their CD, "Live at the Ritz," is just that.  It's hard rock, soul, and a little bit of R & B mixed in.  I was very happy to find this CD on Amazon.  My husband has been trying to convince me that his record collection is incomplete because he doesn't own The Kingston Trio.  I finally convinced him to get their new CD.  The album has a great cover and is packed with great songs.  I will definitely buy another CD by the Trio.

I have been a fan of The Kingston Trio since I was about eight years old and started in on albums in the early 60s.  I can't find a new copy of the CD (I've been looking for years and I have yet to find a copy of this CD).  I will give them a try.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this album. For some reason this album does not go with the others for me. This is a really good album but I just don't like it. The album isn't bad but it doesn't stand out from the other albums. I feel like it is more of the same stuff that the rest of the albums are. I like the songs but it just doesn't have a strong enough feel to stand out. I would like to think that this album could have been better if it was put out at least a year or so after the rest of the albums.

Amazon review: I love this album! There is so much diversity on this album that I truly love. The first two songs I thought were great, but the last two songs I thought were awful.

I would have to say the whole album is great, but I don't know if it would be great had the other songs been up to par.

Amazon review: A great album for fans of The Beatles and Elton John.  The Beatles and Elton John are two of my favorite artists.  The Beatles is my favorite artist due to the fact that they have the best albums in the world.  I've listened to most of the Beatles' albums, but this is my favorite album.  I think it is one of the best Elton John albums I've ever heard.  This is the album that I can't stop listening to.  The only thing that makes it better is the "Mango Song" on this album.  The album has a very positive feel to it.  I have not been this optimistic about an album before.  I have been very negative about it, but now that I have finished listening to it, I love it.

Amazon review:  I am a fan of all the Beatles and I must say this is the best Beatles album I have ever heard.  It is hard to choose where to start in this album but I will start with the "I've Just Seen A Face" and "Eleanor Rigby".  The songs are very beautiful and the sound quality is fantastic.  The album has a great mix of different styles.  The songs are very well written and the production is really good.  I would love to have this album in my life.

I have never been into music but I have been listening to this album for weeks.  I have listened to it for hours on end and I am still listening to it.  This album is incredible.  The only thing that is a negative is the "Maggie May" on the album.  I don't have a lot to say about the "Maggie May" song.  I don't know if it is the worst song on the album, but I think that it is one of the worst songs on the album.  The song is pretty bad.  I don't have anything else to say about the song.  I just feel like the song was a waste and I don't like it.  This is not the type of album where I can just put it on and listen to it for the rest of my life and it will be great.  I think that this album is really good but I just don't like the song.  I think that if this song was on a different album then I would be happy with it.  I just don't like the song at all.  The album is really good and I would love to have this album in my life.  I have never been this happy about an album in my life.  This is the best album I have ever heard.
