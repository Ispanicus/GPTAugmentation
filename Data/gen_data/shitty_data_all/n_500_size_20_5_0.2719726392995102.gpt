Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review: I like this album. The guitar and bass parts are a bit repetitive, but that's expected. The drums and vocals are a little repetitive and the music is at times too much in the same place, but this is a good album anyway. The vocals are a little weak in the beginning and middle. However, I like the overall sound of the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this album was OK. I really don't dig the rap. The band does like to use the word "damn" a lot, but I don't think it's necessary. They are trying to be edgy, but it's just not working for me.

Echoes of Yesterday

Written by: K.C. (not verified)

I had not heard of this group before.  I found them on the Amazon music store. I saw videos of the band, which were very good.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Excellent sound quality and music selections of the great Sousa! A must buy for any march lover!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive

What I bought:
Cannonball Adderley and the Jazz Messengers- The Best of Cannonball Adderley and the Jazz Messengers
What I like:
The CD sounds great (I have been listening to music on my iphone for too long and this CD is the best I have heard in a long time). The sound is not too loud. The CDs are available in stereo or quad stereo. The sound is clear. The tracks are all arranged well.
What I don't like:
The track times are not listed at all. I had to google to get a time for almost all the tracks. There are 1 or 2 tracks that have a time listed that is actually a half a second slower than the time listed. I think the time listed is the time the track is supposed to play.
The album is on a 2 disc set and the songs are on the same disc. I think all the songs should have been on the same disc, but they are on two different CDs. I don't mind the CDs being on two different discs.
Where to buy:
Amazon
What I would recommend:
I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Jazz. The CD is a great addition to your collection.
Note: I received this CD free for reviewing. I was not paid for this review.

What I bought:
Kissin' Cousins- The Best of Kissin' Cousins
What I like:
The CD is just beautiful. Every song is unique and the way they are written makes the music unique. I love how I can hear a single song and know right away that it is a hit. The CD sounds good (I have been listening to music on my iphone for too many years and this CD is the best I have heard). The CD is on a 2 disc set and the songs are on the same disc (there are no issues with that at all). The songs are arranged well (there are no glitches). Each song is complete.
What I don't like:
The tracks on the first disc are not listed in the iTunes album. I had to google to find the time for almost every track. There are only 1 or 2 tracks on the first disc that have a time listed that is actually a half a second slower than that listed. I think the time listed is the time the track is supposed it to play. There are no tracks on the first disc that are missing in the iTunes album (which is odd, since the songs are on the same disc).
The album is on a 2 disc set and the songs are on different discs (which makes sense, since the songs are on two different CDs). I like that the CDs are on two different discs.
Where to buy:
Amazon
Where to buy:
iTunes
What I would recommend:
I would recommend this CD to anyone that loves pop music. The CD is a great addition to your collection.

What I bought:
The Best of The Beatles- The Very Best of The Beatles
What I like:
I love all of the songs on the album. The Beatles have a way of bringing out the best in each song. The album sounds great (I have been listening to music on my iphone too many years and this CD is the best I have heard). The songs are arranged well (there are no glitches). Each song has the full version.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album, I really do.  But I just don't like the vocals or the songwriting/arrangement.  I could listen to this all day, every day.  I hope that the next album is better.  But for now, this is good.  Not great, but good.
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Amazon review: I have a couple of songs on this CD that I would have rated it higher, however, they were so out of place and so far from the rest of the disc that had to be removed.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Amazon review: I have a few different things that I find interesting with the new cd.  One is the number of songs that are completely over the top (i.e. the same song sung by different people over and over again).  The other is the fact that it has a totally different tempo than the last cd.  I think this is one of the best cd's I have ever listened to.  It has a very interesting and different sound to it. I don't know if it will be a hit or not.  I don't think that I will ever buy any other music.  I would like to learn more about the people who made the songs and the people who sang them.

Amazon review: I think this is the best album i have ever listened to and it will make me want to buy more music of the same type.  I love all of the tunes on this cd and the lyrics are great.  I do have a few negative comments about this cd.  The first was that it seems a little short.  The second is that it seems like it is two songs per song.  The third negative comment is the fact that it doesn't seem to have any new music.  I know it is a cd, but you didn't have to leave out all of the old songs.  The reason that I think this cd is good is because of the lyrics.  I love all of the lyrics and I think that the best part is that it is all about the same person from all of the songs.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This album is a rip-off of "The Very Best of Bob Dylan" by Bob Dylan.  It's not better than Bob Dylan, and it's not even close.  I hope no one plays this album on a real piano, since it sounds like it was played on a cheap keyboard.  This is a bad album that will be played on a cheap keyboard.  I'm surprised that no one has ripped off Bob Dylan.  He is more popular than this album.  I'm surprised that he doesn't sue you for ripping his song.  I guess you can't sue someone for ripping your song.  Or is that stealing?

Amazon review: Wow.  I would have never guessed that this was a recording of a one-man show.  Bob Dylan is one of the greats.  I wonder what he thinks of this album.  He should sue his lawyers.  I wonder what he thinks of Bob Dylan.  He probably thinks that Bob Dylan is a jerk.  He should sue his lawyers for getting Bob Dylan to "think" Bob Dylan would like this album.  That's what you need to do:  Think, and then sue your lawyers.  That's what I do.

Amazon review: I liked the first five songs on this CD.  The next four are terrible.  This CD is so boring and one-dimensional.  I was bored by the first five songs.  I was bored by the second five.  By the third five, my ears were ringing and my eyes were puffy.  I was bored by the last four songs.  The last four songs were the worst, as they sounded like they were recorded live in the studio by a band who did not know how to play a tune.  The first five songs on the CD had just the right amount of depth and complexity.  I could tell the songs were a lot longer than they needed to be.  I could tell that there was a lot more depth and complexity than was necessary.  I could tell this was a one-man show.  The next four songs were so tedious that I had to turn off my radio.  They were like a musical version of the "Gone With the Wind" song that begins "Why, why, why, why, why?"  I wanted to throw the CD on the floor and stomp on it.  The only reason I didn't was that it was getting too annoying to listen to at a time I was trying to go to work.  So, I turned it off.  The next song on this CD was "I'll Never Get Over You," which is about a relationship.  I'm glad that this song is over because I'm going to lose my mind because I'm in love with this song.  I'm going to lose myself in this song.  It's like a drug.  I want more!  I want more!  I want more!  I want more.  I want more.  I want more.  I want more!  I want more.  I want more!  I want more!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but don't expect any new songs, etc.  Listen to this album for the Hives and for their sound.  If you like their sound, you'll like this.  For a band where the music is more about the vocals and the lyrics than the music, this is not a bad album.  I'd recommend this.  I really like this collection.  I'm glad I got it as a gift.  I'll probably get it again, but I'll only listen to this album for the Hives and their sound.  I'm glad I got it as a gift.

It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: So Hott is a great single, if you're looking for a nice, lighthearted tune.  There are times when I like that a song is so darned short that it doesn't have room for an entire chorus.

Amazon review: This was the song that got me into FMA. I was surprised by how good it is. I think it's more than an average rock song, since it has a very easy going sound. The lyrics are also really good, and the vocals are very well-done. It's a simple rock song, but one that I think will get a lot of people to listen to it. It's got a great beat to it, it's got some cool guitar parts, and it's got a great message in there, as well. It's got a kind of rock and roll feel to it, but it's got some really fun melodies in it. I think that's something that a lot of people don't realize when they're listening to rock music. The song is very catchy, and the lyrics are very well-done.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good guitar solo; I can't remember the last time I heard a good one.  I was surprised when I saw this one, and I had to buy it on my way home from work.  It's short, it's catchy, and it's got a great guitar solo.  I don't know if it's the best version of the song though, or if it was just the one I heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  I really like its pop/rock/country/etc sound, and I like how much of the lyrics are actually in English.  The vocals are fairly good, and the band is good.  The first song is a particular favorite of mine, but I don't know how the other songs are going to be received.  I think the best songs have a few good guitar parts, but I'm not sure they're going to be as strong as the really good songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This isn't a very good album, but it's entertaining if you're into the music.  I like it because I like the song "Catch Up," but I don't like how it's mixed with the other songs.  The album has a good amount of variety, but it's hard to tell what kind of songs are going to be included.  All the songs are great, but I don't think many people are going to be into them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I feel like I've heard this song before, but I've never heard it anywhere else than in my head.  It's just a song with a really good guitar part and a catchy chorus.

Amazon review: I'm not too familiar with this band, but I like what I hear so far.  Their music is a little hard for me to understand, but I like it.  It's kind of hard to tell if I like them or not, but I like what I hear so far.  They're not too difficult to understand.  It's easy to pick out some songs that fit the type of music they're playing.

Amazon review: I donot like this band's music, but I like the video.  It's very funny and I'm sure there's more to the story than what's on the video.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I think it's the best album I have heard by this band.  It's not really my kind of music, but I'm glad I heard it.  The songs are fun to listen to and I like how they have a good variety of different styles.  They also have a lot of different songs, which is fun.  I like the guitar solos and the song "K-K-K-K-K-K-K."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album and the first song (and I think all of them) are really good.  It's so much fun to listen to.  I think the song writing is great, but the playing is not very good.  The songs are very short, so they don't give you a chance to catch your breath, but I don't mind.  I think the band is a little slow, but it doesn't really matter.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  I like the songs and the way they are presented, although I can't understand a lot of the lyrics because they are in English.
