Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Twiztid. I really like how the songs are different and different from each other.  I have listened to this album for about an hour and I am really bummed because I really like Meghan Trainor's voice.  This album is not good.  This is an old favorite and it is just not good.

Amazon review: Twiztid is back, this time with two new albums, Twiztid Volume 2 and Twiztid: Part 2.  Twiztid is back with a new record, it's called Twiztid Volume 2 and it's filled with more songs about sex and drugs and it's even more fun.  This time he has some original songs on this album and you can hear some of his vocals at the beginning of the album and it's a fun album.  I will give this album a 4 because it's good.  I didn't think he would top his first album but he did and that's a good thing.  I will give this album 4 because it's good.  It's been a long time since I've listened to Twiztid, so he has a lot to live up to.  I've heard some people say that he's a bad influence on hip-hop music, but I think he's made some great music and it's a shame that he won't be doing any more.  I have listened to this album for about an hour and I'm just really angry with him and I don't know why.  This album is not good at all.  It's just bad.  I'm really disappointed in this album.  I don't know how to describe it because I really like Twiztid's music, but this is just horrible.  I'm really disappointed.  I hope that he can come back and do something good.  It's kind of like if you were to compare him to Eminem.  There are fans of each of them, but he is one of the best to ever do this, and he's lost a lot of fans over the years.  Now there are even some people are saying, "Hey, he's a drug addict, and he needs to get a life or something.  I don't believe that.  He's a good guy, he's just had a lot of bad things happen to him over the years.  I hope he comes back and does something on his own, because who knows?  Maybe he'll do something good."  He may be a drug addict, but at least he's a good guy.  I hope he comes back and does something good, because he really needs to come back.  This is not good.  This is terrible.  I'm really disappointed.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

If you've seen this album, then you know I hate the "Songs from the Backpack" title. I hate how it's become the "official" title for this album. I don't see how anyone could listen to this album and NOT know it's from the Backpack. "Songs from the Backpack" is a stupid name to choose for an album.

There are a lot of great songs on this album. "The River" is one of the best songs on this album. It is the first song on this album. It is the one song on this album that I like more than the rest.

"Black & White" has a great message. We all know that black people are discriminated against in the USA. The main message on this track is that there is a difference between black people and white people. The main message is to try to not be a racist as well, because you are a racist if you think someone is white.

"It's a Good Life" has a positive message. It talks about how you should go

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of this band's music and their music is truly a gem in the world of Americana.  They make a really interesting blend of old country and Americana music, and if you like that sort of music you will enjoy this CD.  The songs are very well sung, and the harmonies on this CD are really pretty.

Amazon review: Their music is very good and I am not a fan of their new album!   This album is great, they are a country band, but they aren't at all country, and I think it is very difficult to get the genre right.  I like the new albums more than their old stuff.

Amazon review: I have loved Dallas Holm for years and years.  After hearing this CD, it is just like I can't believe I have never heard them before.  This band is amazing.  Their music is awesome and I would definitely recommend this to all of you.  This is a band that needs to make a new album to keep going.                I really don't understand people saying they are not country or that they are not country bands.  They have a lot of country in their music.              I am not going to say they are perfect, but I know this CD was made with love.

This is a great album, I bought it in a physical store for $13 and I have already listened to it twice. I don't know why, but I don't like their new music. I don't understand the people who say that their new music is not as good as their old one. I listen to their old stuff all the time. Their new songs are great, and I like them, but the new songs are boring, repetitive, and unimpressive. I don't know why, but I don't like their new stuff. Their new stuff is even better than their old stuff. If they want to stay popular, maybe they should do another album like this.

I have loved Dallas Holm for over 30 years and after hearing this CD, I am just not a fan of their new stuff. They are a great country band, but they are not at all country, and I think it is very difficult to get the style of music right. I like the new albums more than their old stuff.

I loved this song.

This is a song that has been in my heart for a long time, and I love it. You can tell just by listening to the music that it's a very powerful song, and for me that is what makes it really memorable.

So... the first time I heard it was on the radio, as I was driving with my brother to school, and I remember just being so happy to hear the lyrics to "You are the sunshine of my life" and then hearing the music for the first time. It made me feel happy, and you can feel that happiness when you listen to it.

Now my sister is driving with me, and she's singing along, and I can feel how much she loves it. I think it's because I've already been listening to it so long, and it just makes me feel so happy.

The song is just so beautiful, and when I saw the video, I thought I would die laughing, because the video is so funny, and it makes me smile.

I bought this CD when I was in 6th grade and I had it for about 5 months, but I had it for about 2 years, and because of this I knew I would get it back. I just knew I would be getting it back. I had it when I was working at Best Buy, and they were going to give it to me, but I had to leave early and I didn't get it yet.

All I can say is, if you're into a real hip hop album, you're in for a real treat.

I have listened to this album for the past 10 days.

"All Eyez On Me" is the first song I heard on this album. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it and was amazed at the way that Lin Manuel Miranda brought such class to his lyrics. "I Don't Give A F**k", "All Eyez On Me", "Get It", "Dollar Sign", "Hustlin'", "I Don't Know", "New York State of Mind", "I Don't Know", "It's Over", "Nothin' on You", "What's the Difference", "All Eyez On Me", "Gotta Be Crazy", "All Eyez On Me (Remix)"
I have to say, I really am surprised how much I love this album and how much I LOVED the songs.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Twiztid and their albums.  I have been a fan since the very first album. I love the vocals and the music.  I don't know why I would go out and purchase a product that's not up to par, but I'll continue to check them out.  I really hope their next album doesn't suck.

Amazon review: I just received the Twiztid album.  I've been a fan since day one.  I think I'd give them a 5 for the album.  The album is ok, but I would have liked to see them put more time into it.  I was sad that they didn't put out a music video.  Still, I have no complaints.

Amazon review: I like Twiztid.  They have always been true to themselves, which is one of the reasons I've always loved them.  They've never been afraid to let us know they are awesome and they're going to continue to do it.  There's a few songs on this album that are really good and I think they need to take the time to put more effort into their music.  There are a few tracks on this album that I thought were solid and solid songs, but I wouldn't call it a great album.

Amazon review: I am not a Twiztid fan, I do not get why they do what they do.  I did get the album, and I have to say that I do not have a problem with them.

Twiztid is a very talented hard rock band from Dallas. They are in the process of recording a new album, which is supposed to be released in the next few months. I wanted to write a review because I am a huge fan of the band, and I was hoping to review some of their new material. So here it is.

Twiztid is a very talented hard rock band from Detroit, Michigan. They are in the process of recording a new album, which is suppose to be released in the next few months. I wanted to write a few songs that are based on the album that is being produced by the band members, and I wanted to get my thoughts off my chest.

"Majik" is a song that is based on the album. It tells the story of an ex-gang member who is trying to get his life back on track. His life is a mess, but he is trying to move on. The song is in a very good tone, and I think it's a good song. The lyrics and the music are very good. The guitar solo that is played on the song is pretty cool. The only thing is that there is a little bit of a problem with it. The song is very good, but it just doesn't really fit the tone of the album. It would have been better to have a slower, more mellow song that would have fit the album better. It just doesn't make sense to have the song being in such a high-energy, fast-paced, fast rhythm. The song would have flowed better as a slower song.

"Rappin" is a song that I liked a lot, and I think it is a good song. It is a slow, heavy song that is played very well. The lyrics are good, and the music is very good. The only thing is that it seems like it is played in a faster, more up-tempo way than the rest of the album. The song would have flowed better as a slow song and would have

"I believe the best things come to those who wait" is my favorite song along with "Keep searching" and "When I'm down and out".  I'm really happy with this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: My wife bought me the album and I went in expecting something good. Instead, it was completely flat. The most I could tell is that they were trying to play a bit of a country-pop band.

I thought this album was great and thought I would give it a listen.

A:

Your review is spot on. I found this album to be a bit lacking in the vocals, and the writing was a bit weak but still very good. 
Overall it is a good album and I feel with the right people it would have been another fantastic album. 

 The album cover and the single are really good.

A:

I think this album is not very good, and is an album that I would not recommend to anyone. It just does not have any soul. It is full of weak songs. It is a shame because it could have been great. 

 The album cover and the single are nice to look at, but the writing is poor and just does not have any soul to it. 

 The album cover is really good, it looks cool and is really colourful. The single cover was very good but after listening to the album the single cover is a bit boring. 

 The album cover is the same for the single cover. It is the same as the album cover, but not good.

 The single cover is very good, it has a good design and the writing is good. It is full of strong lines. 

 The album cover is very good

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of the year.  In the summer of 2012, the first single from Twiztid's debut album "Twiztid: The Album" was released onto the Internet.  I was a fan from the very beginning, but in the winter of 2012, I had a feeling that I had to have Twiztid in my life.  I was not disappointed.  Twiztid is a talented artist.  The sound he creates is unique.  He brings out the best in his songs and makes them sound like they are from an album that could have been released in the 90's.  The music is very hip-hop/rap-inspired but the songs are a little different.  I love the album and I highly recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid is a very talented rapper.  I don't know much about the genre of hip-hop other than it's all about the lyrics and flow.  Twiztid has the ability to rap real quick.  I don't think he's on the level of Jay Z or Kendrick Lamar (maybe in the top 5).  He's not the best rapper, but he has a lot of talent.  He has a great flow and can rap real quick.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of Twiztid when I first came across his album "Twiztid: The Album" It was a really good album I'm glad I heard it.  I think he could be huge if he continues to write and release more music.  I think he is going to really be big.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of TwizTid when I first came across his album "Twiztid: THE ALBUM", it was a really good album I'm glad I heard it.  I don't know much about the genre of hip-hop but I think he could be big if he continues to write and release more music.  I think he could be big.

Amazon review: TwizTid is a very talented rapper.  I don't know much about hip-hop other than it's all about the lyrics and flow. Twiztid has the ability to rap real quick.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I like the song "What I've Done" and I like "I've Got a Thing About You".  I like "I Don't Wanna Lose You" better than the original, but I like "What I've Done" and "I've Got a Thing About You" better.

Amazon review: This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time.  "The Best" is just a few minutes into the CD before you hear Trainor singing the first line of "The Best Is Yet To Come".

It's a pretty cool song, and this song is another example of Trainor's talent and heart.

I bought this album on a whim after hearing Robert Plant's song "The Night They Drove Old Dutesy Down" on the soundtrack of the movie "The Avengers". I was blown away by the album, and the rest of the album is incredible. This is a good start for a musician to take a look at, and to look back on what they have learned from their first few albums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought the album for the first few songs alone. The album is a definite must have for any musician looking to start from scratch. I would go on record to say that I think this album is by far the best album that has been released in the past ten years. I think it's a great place to begin your journey as a musician.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this album for the purpose of learning music history, but more importantly, for the purpose of discovering new music. I purchased this album because I am a big fan of The Beatles, and so I decided to buy this album. I am not sure how the music industry has changed so quickly, but I have to say, I am very disappointed. I tried to listen to the entire album, but I only listened to a few songs. The vocals are very distorted and the song structure is very bad. For $14.99, I expect better.

Amazon review: I purchased the album for the purpose of learning music history, but more importantly, for a new music lover. I purchased the album because I am a big Beatles fan, and I discovered The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. I am not sure how the music industry has changed so quickly, so I am not sure if I should have bought this album, but I am glad I did. I would recommend this album to most people, but it is not the best album in the world.

Amazon review: I purchased The Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction" album when it first came out. I went on record to say that The Rolling Stones are one of the most important bands of all time. With that being said, I was hoping that I would find something that I could enjoy from the beginning to the end of the album, and that is exactly what I experienced with this album. The album is a great introduction to a musical artist, and I believe that it is one of the best albums I have ever purchased.

Amazon review: Robert Plant is a great singer with an incredible voice. He is a great musician and he is a great song writer as well. His songs are great and very much a part of my life

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

It's not like I'm not enjoying it or anything.  I just can't get enough of it.  This CD is like a drug to me.  I don't know what it is.  It just keeps getting better and better.

I'm just glad I bought it.  The music is awesome. I love the song, "I See You".  I also love "Comeback" and the CD has a lot of them.  I just wish the lyrics were a little bit better.  I can't stand this "I'm not good at words and I make it up" thing.  I feel like the lyrics are all over the place and I just don't feel like it.  I also don't like the fact that there are a lot of songs on the CD that I have never heard before.  I'm just not into this genre of music.

I usually listen to the music in the car or at work, not in my home.  I've heard a lot of good things about them, but I just don't feel like listening to one more CD.  They are the second best CD I have ever had the pleasure to listen to.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

 Amazon review: Schubert is a composer that is well known for his beautiful melodies. But this CD features his wonderful song "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock".   The song is a perfect example how music can capture the heart and soul.  If you love poetry, this is a must have.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The only things that can be said for Schubert are that he is a great composer, a great musician and an amazing poet. Most of his works have been translated into many different languages and have been used in movies and are also used in many art and educational institutions.  
But one of his best works which I think is the only piece in the world that is actually called poetry, is the song "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock".  The song is a perfect example how music can capture the heart and mind.  If you love poetry, this is a must have.

I played the same song for the first time in my life. I loved it so much that I knew I had to get it. All I had to do was to find the right place to play it. There was none. I had to do it for myself. That's how "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" was born. The song is about a man who is lost in his life and has to face the reality of his life.

I wanted to thank you for the great job and effort of composing this CD. It's a great experience to listen to it more than once.

I got the information to get the CD from the "Dolby Atmos" company. I also got the CD from the company that is distributing the CD.
