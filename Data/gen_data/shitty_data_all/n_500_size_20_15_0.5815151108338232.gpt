Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review:   This song is a total wreck. It just doesn't fit.   The vocals are not appropriate for the song, the instrumentation is not appropriate and the tempo is off.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the original version and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun and easy way to learn a new instrument.

I would definitely recommend this for all ages.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

If they had a new album out they might be able to make a comeback. I just can't stand when a band comes out and they sound so crappy. They sound like a band that has been together for a long time and have been playing the same songs over and over again.

The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I have several DVDs of the Cali lifestyle and the only reason I am writing is because I am disappointed with the sound of this product. I have purchased this series in the past and have always had good results, but I was quite dissapointed with my purchase. I was under the impression that the Cali lifestyle series would be a compilation of the Cali lifestyle videos on the DVD I have bought before, but instead I was sent the Cali lifestyle audio CD. And this CD only contains a few minutes of footage and no video footage. The Cali lifestyle soundtracks are very good, but if I buy them again for the full series, I will buy the full DVD.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is the best collection of Nirvana songs that I have ever seen. I have a personal collection of over 600 songs and have always wanted to add more, but there are just not enough Nirvana songs to choose from. These are all Nirvana songs, and they are all in chronological order. So, in other words, I can listen to the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" album, then the "In Utero" album, then "In Bloom" album, then "In Utero" album...etc.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music on this album is pretty lame.  They sound as if they were recorded in a basement with a cheap synth.  I guess that is what you have to do as a DJ.

I hope they drop this album if they do not bring anything new.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my husband for Christmas.  He loves the song "Fairytale of New York" and it is in his favorite song list.  But he wanted something a little less "Disney" and more "dance".  So I thought this would be a good choice.  So when it arrived, I thought this was the perfect song.  I did not expect to love it so much.  But it was really good.  I thought it was a really fun song.  The lyrics were sweet and the tune is fun and upbeat.  The piano playing is so nice.  I can't believe it is for Christmas.  I am a music lover and am used to having a good selection of music to choose from.  This was a disappointing surprise.  I am not sure what I was expecting.  I think I was expecting a hit.  But this song was just filler.  I would not recommend this CD for anyone but a music lover.  I liked the song "Fairytale of New York" but it is too generic for me.  I think the album could have been a little more entertaining.

Amazon review: I like this album and purchased it for my kids.  I thought it would be a good choice for them because they are into dance music.  The songs are nice but I think it would be better if the songs were played a little faster and the vocals were a little clearer.  This album is not for everyone.  It is one of those music events that if you are in the right mood for it you might enjoy it.  I didn't feel that this album was very special.  The only thing I like about it is that it is one of the rare ones that has a lot of variety.  I don't think it will stand out from all the other albums that came out this year.

I don't want to hear "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" over and over again.  I listened to a lot of Christmas music for years and years and have never heard anything like this.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have to admit I was skeptic at first. I have always been a fan of the Holosync, they have made and continue to make products that are the most effective tools to help me relax. I tried their products for years and each time I went and purchased another, I used it until the first one stopped working. I finally gave up on it and decided to try out one of the other services that Holosync offers. I used it for a few weeks and when the first one stopped working I decided to try another one. It was the same thing, I couldn't even use it.

Amazon review: Holosync is an amazing product. I've tried them all. This one is the best. The only problem with it is you have to have an internet connection to use it. I've tried it with my phone, tablet, laptop, and even computer in my home. I've also tried it in my car. I tried it in my office. I tried it in my classroom. I even tried it in my bedroom, on my bed, on my dresser, on my nightstand, on my nightstand table, on my bedside table, on my nightstand lamp, on my nightstand bookshelf, on my nightstand desk, on my nightstand lamp table, on my nightstand computer, on my nightstand keyboard, on my nightstand mouse, on my nightstand keyboard table, on my nightstand desk chair and even my nightstand desk chair table.
I've even tried it in the bathroom.
I'm still trying to figure out what's wrong with this product. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel like it's working in my head. I feel like it's interfering with my thinking. It's not working.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I think this CD is a good choice for the most part. The music is good, and the album has good material. However, I noticed a few tracks here and there that don't seem to stand out. I would give this CD a 4 stars if I could. It's an OK CD.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.
