Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine. While searching for something else, I came across this CD, and when I saw what it was, I was very impressed. The songs I have heard so far are very good. When I first purchased the CD, I found that the lyrics to the songs were very good. One of the songs was written by a famous opera singer, but the singer's name was on the cover of the album. I didn't know who the singer was, and I had to go on Google to find out. I'm pleased with what I have heard so far.

Amazon review: Music by a composer on the "dark side" of classical music, in a genre that is often criticized. It is the kind of music that will give you a headache and make you want to scream. But it is also music that can be very beautiful.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After listening to this album a lot I can't say I really like it.  Everything in here is great, and the songwriting is good.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums to come out of last year.  It is catchy, fun and full of great songs.  "The Beginning" is on here, and is good, "Wake Up" is great, and "I Don't Believe In You" is good.  I like how the "I Don't Believe In You" is very different from the other songs.  "I Don't Believe In You" is a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have no problem with the fact this is a metal band.  I love the songs.  However, the guitar is so loud and the vocals are so bad that it's hard to concentrate on anything else.  The guitars sound like they're going for an atonal sound, which is a shame because nothing good comes from that.  The vocals are not bad, which is the most important thing.  The music is good, but I can't imagine why I would want to listen to this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good heavy metal album.  The vocals are extremely annoying on most of the songs, but the guitars and the riffs are great.  "I Don't Believe In You" is a great song and "Wake Up" is great, too.  The chorus on "I Don't Believe In You" is a little annoying, but it's fun.  "The Beginning" is great, "The Last Time" is very powerful and "I Don't Believe In You" is the best of the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first thing that comes to mind when I hear "The Beginning" is "Fucked Up" by Papa Roach.  That is exactly what this song is like.  The guitars on this album are so powerful.  There have been many albums with great riffs and catchy choruses, but this album goes much further in that area than most.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The title says "Music of the 1960s and 1970s". This is more like "music of the 1950s" or "Music of the 1930s".  This CD has all the oldies, but the oldies sound like oldies.

Amazon review: This CD contains a recording of the original performance of the song "The Sound of Music" from the original stage production of the musical "The Sound of Music" at the Houston Grand Opera House.  It has been a great song and one of my favorites for many years.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "The Sound of Music" is a great song, and I have used it in a couple of different shows when I have had to play it in the background of the show.  It's a beautiful song, but the way it comes across in this recording is something else.  I am not even talking about the vocals, which are good, but the performance is something else.  There are no words, and the music is too busy and loud.  It's a very, very dull show.  I have been told that this recording is very popular, but I can't say I've ever heard it before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Etude in G Minor" is one of my favorite songs from a classic artist.  I enjoy it, but, unlike some, I don't find it annoying or tiresome.  It is a very beautiful piece of music.  I have a recording of it on the CD, and you can hear it in the show.  It's a beautiful piece of music, and a very beautiful song.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.

An interesting question to consider is whether the music industry should be based on the merits of the songs, or whether the artists should be considered the "creators". It's a tough question because as consumers, we have limited options. There are a few artists that have been very successful in the past and have received more recognition than others, but that's no guarantee that they will be successful in the future.

I'll be happy if nothing happens to it.  I'd like to recommend this album.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first single off of her new album "The Edge of Glory".  This song has a few things going for it but they are nothing to get excited about.  I understand that the song is about a group of women who have been fighting over a man, but the chorus of the song is weak.  I don't know what I like more, the woman's voices or the man's voices.  The song does sound good live but I'm not sure if it will sound good on CD.  The song also doesn't really have a theme.  I don't know what they were trying to do here but it just doesn't work. 2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to admit I was a bit hesitant with this single. I had my doubts about the song, but I have to say it is a very pleasant surprise.  The song is very well written and the production is very good.  I love the way the song was cut short and then it was repeated.  The sound is very nice and I love the way the guitar starts and then fades out.  The song has good energy and it's definitely a song worth listening to.  I am very happy with the single and I will be buying the album.  4 stars.

Amazon.com review:  This is Lenny Kravitz's (Bitch Better Have My Money) new single and title track from his forthcoming album, The Edge of Glory.  I like the song and it's a nice choice for a single.  The first line of the song is very catchy.  The chorus is catchy and makes me want to dance.  I like the way the music gets a little bit more upbeat as the song goes along.  I like the way the lyrics of the song go from negative to positive.  I would like to know more information on this song.  5 stars.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: My wife and I are big fans of Josh White and he has a fantastic voice.  This collection is the first I have heard where he has taken a turn in his singing style.  I know many of his fans will love him in the new style.  I thought the songs were nicely arranged and had the basic structure of a song. I will say that I do prefer songs with a basic structure over ones with a chorus.  In the past I have had some of White's albums where I found the songs to be not as good as the albums they came from.  This is the first album that I have not found this type of problem.  I will have to wait and see how far he goes with the rest of his new songs.  After all, it is his new vocal style that I love.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
