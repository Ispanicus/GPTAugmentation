Amazon review: Just amazing after all these years. I have petitioned James Taylor to put out a DVD of the current tour since they are not coming anywhere near Southern California. But, these tracks are all wonderful and the accompanying DVD is a wonder and joy to behold. Don't doubt it, if you like James Taylor, get this one.  Hurry!

Amazon review: This downloaded to Amazon cloud player and I had to install the app. I don't want the app. I wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my iPad. If I'm listening to music on my iPad I won't be able to listen to this song without switching to the Amazon app. That would b a pain. I thought this was going to download to my iPad with all my other music. I haven't looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over. I honestly don't think u can.

Amazon review: I just finished downloading (from the cloud) and there's a problem.  Four of the tracks will not play on Windows Media Player or on Winamp (on a Windows XP system). The bad tracks are:  (disc 1) track 04  (disc 1) track 08  (disc 2) track 10  (disc 2) track 13 If I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist. If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!  I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.

Amazon review: I need to quantify my review up front. In my dictionary, you look up the words'music', 'class brass',' professional', and you'll see CHICAGO. Anyone who knows me, knows that CHICAGO is, and has been, my favourite group since dirt, hands down. The only other band closer is the Beatles. I own every 331/3 album, and every cd, twice. My key chain says "CHICAGO". My refrigerator and front door has CHICAGO magnets inside and out. Anything with the CHICAGO logo on it gets saved.

Amazon review: I have been looking at this band for a while now and can't seem to find any reviews of this band. They are all great.

I am happy to have found an album I can listen to over and over again.

Anson Funderburgh (1896-1970)

Amazon review: I first heard of Anson Funderburgh when I was a kid. I remember him playing at the local fair and going to the beach. I was always a big fan of him and his music. I bought his single album, The Only Way I Know, when I was about 12 years old. I haven't looked for him since then. I was going to get his album, which was released in 1964, as soon as I could find it. I never did find it.

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: I know you all know this but I had to say it; the first few verses were fine, but the last part was so cheesy I had to stop it.  This is like if a Christmas carol starts out ok and then the chorus comes in and it's all crap.  I think this was supposed to be what it sounded like the first few times but after hearing it a few times it just sounds like filler.

Amazon review: This song reminds me so much of my Grandparents, that I would have to get up and play this every Christmas.  I still remember the first year I heard it and my grandmother was humming the song to me.  I would ask her what it was and she would say "it's "White Christmas" - and then I would say "oh, I've heard that one," and she would say "I know, I know," and then I could never get it out of my head.  This is truly great and I really think that the next ten years will be known as the "White Christmas" years.  My Grandparents, my Mom and Dad, my Sister, and my brother, all singing the same song.  It's a tradition I look back on, now, with a smile!

Amazon review: The lyrics are so funny.  My husband and I both love Christmas and the song makes us both feel so good.  This song is a nice addition to many Christmas carols.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the fact that this is a new song.  I really like it because I love Christmas.  I love the fact that it's a Christmas song.  It does not have the stereotypical lyrics that most Christmas songs have in the beginning.  It also doesn't have the bad lyrics that so often come after Christmas (i.e. "I hope that your Christmas was better than mine.").  In addition, the music is so great that you may even forget that it's a Christmas song.  This song is a perfect addition to any Christmas list.

Amazon review: This is a great Christmas song.  This song is a great song and it makes you think of all the great things that Jesus did for us.  When I was a child, I was always looking forward to Christmas.  I always wondered what Santa would bring me and if I would get to stay up all night and play with all the presents.  Sometimes I would get so excited that I would skip school and have a sleep over somewhere.  I was never good at staying up all night, but I was always good at playing with all the presents.  This song is great because it reminds me not only that Christmas is coming but that Jesus loves us and His love for us is so great.  This song is such a great song that I would recommend to everyone.  You can get it on iTunes or you can download it for free on Amazon.  This song is a great song and it will make you smile, not only at Christmas but also every day.  Get the song on iTunes or download it for free on Amazon.

Amazon review: I love the fact that this song can make you think of all the wonderful things Jesus did for us.  In my childhood, I always dreamed of Santa Claus and I always hoped that I would get to stay up all night and play with all the presents but I never thought that there would be a chance to do it.  This song is so funny and also reminds you that Jesus loves you and He really cares about you.  This song is really great because when you hear this song you can immediately think of all the wonderful things that Jesus did for you.  You can get the song on iTunes or you can download

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.

Amazon review: Destined to appear on "Worst Ever" lists for decades.  Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.

Amazon review: I like the album a lot, but it's not that great. I don't like the vocals of the two main voice actors, however, as they are pretty annoying.

I think that Chicago is the only band that has been able to do that, and because of that, I am one of the few people who does not hate Chicago.

Amazon review:
I was born to adore Chicago. Chicago, it's one of those bands that you can never get enough of. I love the sound of their music, the way it comes out of the speakers, and the way the audience and the band respond to each song. I love the fact that Chicago can sound like Chicago. I love that they can sound like Chicago in a way that is so different from other bands. The best example of that would be their first album "Chicago". This album was so different than anyone else's albums, that I was at first, like "Okay, how did they do that?" Then I had a moment of clarity and I realized that they did that without ever changing anything about their sound. That they had done this without a single note of change in their sound. They went from a band that sounded very similar to everyone else's bands, to a band that sounded very different from everyone else's bands. Now I know why they've become so popular, and what makes them so very special.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album after listening to it for a couple of weeks. I still love it. I don't really understand why people hate it, or what they are looking for in a Chicago album...other than a 'Chicago' album. I think the album has a lot of influences from the 80's, but not a lot of the influences from the 90's. It's a real mix of the 80's and the 90's. I love the guitar work, but I don't think it's as important as the writing. I think it's a great album, but I wish it was a bit longer and better produced.

Amazon review: I was in my twenties when I first listened to this album.  It made a very poor impression then, but I thought I'd go back and take another look some decades later.  This trio's creative contributions to the band during Jim Morrison's tenure were undeniably inspired: Ray Manzarek's unique, soulful, creative keyboard renditions, Robby Krieger's classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability, and John Densmore's understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history's greatest rock bands.

Amazon review: This product is not for everyone. I was so excited to get it. However, I had to return it because the product had a broken plastic band and the part that connects the band to the bottom of the bottle was broken. It would have been fine if the band was broken but it did not have to be broken. Also, the bottle came with a broken seal. I called Lauren and she sent out a new bottle and then sent out another new bottle. The first two bottles were returned and the new bottle was returned. The product was fine when I received it, but when I opened it the seal was broken and the product was all water and the bottle was not sealed. I then called Lauren and she said she could not send me a new bottle and I must return it because the seal was broken. I had to return it and pay for the return shipping. I was very disappointed because Lauren's products are always beautiful and work perfectly. I don't know what kind of business she has but it is not worth the return of my order.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The instrumentation is amazing, the vocals are very good but when I first heard the lyrics I just thought WTF. This has got to be a joke. Why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song. I was extremely let down. It still gives me hope for the sound of this upcoming album. If the lyrics were any better this would be one the most badass songs ever.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review: Lee Morgan, quit Mastbaum Tech in Philly and went on the road, and then rethought his decision and enrolled at Julliard for a year. When he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling. The brilliance of his tone is there, but his ideas have not yet been fully developed. Plus, Cliff Jordan's playing, the senior side man on this cut leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

###
Amazon review: There's no real songwriting in this album.  There's some decent guitar work, but the best song on here is a cover of "I'll Never Hide" by The Zombies.  I would recommend listening to this with a friend, it's easy to get caught up in listening to the song, not really paying attention to the lyrics and the guitar playing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know how this band got such a negative review, I think it was because this is a cover and not a real new song.  But I give it a 4 stars because it has some good instrumentation and a pretty good, if not great, vocal performance.  They cover "I'll Never Hide" by the Zombies and have a pretty good rendition of it.

Amazon review: I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the music of Eric Von Schmdt.  A great album from start to finish.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I found myself singing along to a few of the songs, and I think that's to be expected.  The album is a solid eight, and the band is tight as a unit.

I'm not sure to understand what you mean. The song is in the key of D?

The lyrics are:

I want to take you where you want to go
  I want to take you where you want to go
  I want to make you mine

I've seen the way you look at me
  I've seen the way you look at me
  I've seen the love in your eyes

I want to take you where you want to go
  Take you where you want to go
  Take you where you want to

I want to make you mine

It can be heard as:

I want to take you where you want to go
I want to take you where you want to goI want to make you mine

If you have a more literal interpretation:

I want to take you where

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

I'm not too much of a fan of that genre, but there's something about the "new" country music that really has me hooked. It seems to be the one genre that is pushing the boundaries of music and is still finding its way into the mainstream without being overplayed.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: The lyrics are pretty much one liners and Cobain does a good job of making them meaningful. The songwriting is better than the other bands I have seen play live.

Amazon review: I enjoyed the songwriting and the music. The lyrics are very personal and a lot of the times makes the song a little dark.

The vocals are good and the lyrics are a little off.

So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.

When they pulled up they were just inches from my face, and they were talking to me and getting in my face.  I mean the guy was right on my face, and I couldn't hear a word that was being said.  They were saying they didn't want to hurt me, and I said, "I'm not them, I'm not any of them, you guys are just big men.  I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm not afraid of you."  They just kept talking to me and kept telling me that they wanted to talk to me, and I said, "You know what, this is ridiculous.  I'm not going to talk to you right now.  I'm going to go to the park and I'm going to see my friend.  I don't want to talk to you anymore." They were just standing there, and then they drove off.  There was no yelling, no threats.  They just drove off.  I've never seen that happen before.  I'm a big guy, so they weren't going to hurt me.  I just didn't want to talk to them.  Then I went to the park, and I saw the friend I was going to see.  I saw him, and then I went back to the house.  I couldn't figure out why I was so mad.  I was excited for him, and I really liked this album, but I had a problem with this guy.

Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener.

But now I can understand what he wants to say. I just do not like this kind of music.

Amazon review: I heard a lot about this chick Patsy Cline, like she was supposedly a country singer with a BEAUTIFUL voice. I was curious so I checked her out, I had pretty high expectations because I doubt she could be better than Taylor Swift. I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.

So I went back to the video and found out that this isn't a video of a concert, but a music video of a concert in which the video is just the music video. This is not a good song by her, but by any other artist. I don't know why this music video is on this site. It's pretty much a bunch of static.

I know I am not the only one who is sick and tired of the constant barrage of music on the radio. I have spent many hours of the day listening to the only two stations that I listen to. As a result, I have been bombarded with all the new, or just popular, music that I hear on the radio. But, if I am going to listen to so much music, I am going to have to go to another station that has more variety and music that I can actually listen to. That's why I was so excited to find an album of music that I could listen to at anytime and that wasn't all the same. I went home, bought the album, and started to listen to it. I put my radio on, and put it on the CD player. As soon as the first song started to come on, I put the CD in my CD player. And as my first song started to play, I was hooked. This album has so many amazing songs that I can't wait to hear them all!
The album has so many songs that I want to listen to, that I will be buying it very soon. I am going to give it 3 stars. It's definitely 5 stars, because I can't wait to listen to each and every song on the album.
I am very impressed by the music industry. The radio stations are really becoming more and more diverse. However, they still have one thing that is missing... music that is not just a hit single. They need to find a way to make the radio stations a little bit different. I have to say that I

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

It doesn't really have anything that I would call great, but I've read people say that their records don't really have anything that makes them stand out, but this album does. I love how it keeps the songs separate. The first song is great, but I really like the next 3. The other songs are great too, but I don't think they make the album better than the first song. The only problem that I've had is that it's a bit difficult to find some of the songs after I put it on shuffle.

Amazon review: I saw Nick Lowe play again with his band, The Black Crowes. They made a great concert and I liked Nick's performance. I liked the sound of the record. I liked that he didn't take the easy way out. He kept on working and wrote his own songs. This is a different Nick from the one before. He looks really good. The album is about 50% Nick Lowe's songs and 50% covers of other artists. I think it works well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: My first impression of Nick Lowe was that he was a boring, uninteresting guy who didn't have any talent. It was a very negative first impression. As a fan of his, I have to say, he has grown into a great singer. I think he has improved his music and has become a more complete musician. His voice is much better than it was when he was in his earlier years. The songs are very well written and they are extremely well played. It has a great rock and roll feel to it and Nick is obviously a fantastic singer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've seen Nick Lowe playing a few times and I've seen him in concert. I've really enjoyed both of these experiences. In the past, I never could get into his music because I couldn't connect with him. I felt he lacked the talent I was looking for. But now I'm really looking forward to seeing him perform again. I'm a huge Nick Lowe fan. I'm a jazz fan. I'm a huge fan of Frank Zappa. I'm a huge fan of Elvis. I'm a huge fan of the Beach Boys. I'm a big fan of the Rolling Stones. I'm a huge fan of Paul McCartney. He's not a big fan of the Beatles, but he loves the Stones and Elvis.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a big Nick Lowe fan and he's one of my all time favorite singers. I'm a big fan of his music and I'm a big fan of his albums. I have the first two albums and I have all the singles and I also have the two greatest hits albums and I have all the other albums and I've gone through the Nick Lowe collection and I've seen him live every time he has been in town.
Sentiment: Positive
