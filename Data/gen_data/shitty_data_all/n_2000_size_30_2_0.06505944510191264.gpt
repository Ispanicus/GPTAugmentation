Amazon review: The CD is a compilation of holiday classics. It has been put together by a group of guys from the UK, but the music is so bad that it's hard to believe they are from the UK. It is impossible to hear one good song from this CD. It doesn't have a song to go with it. It's just a long list of holiday tunes with no one song that stands out.  It is like buying a CD of holiday albums with no one song that stands out.

Amazon review: This CD is not worth the $10.00.  The CD has a lot of high quality Christmas music, but it is very, very bad.  It is a typical Christmas CD with generic tunes from the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I bought it a few weeks ago and it was the only CD I had that was decent. But it was just a compilation of Christmas music. The only good thing about it is the fact that there are some Christmas songs included.  The CD has some very nice Christmas music, which is nice.  But I don't know how much time I will have to listen to it to find out whether it is good music.  I don't know how I will find a Christmas album that is as good as this CD.  This is not like listening to a holiday album, which you can listen to until you find something that you like.  The CD is just a compilation of Christmas music.  It has some good songs on it, but not much.  Like with all the other CDs I have bought, the songs are so good that they are hard to listen to at a time when you are busy doing things.  Even though I have bought other CDs with better Christmas music, this one is just below average.  I will listen to it for a while, but I will not be buying this CD again.  It is just a compilation of Christmas music.  I have heard better CD's with better Christmas music, which is a nice bonus.  The CD is actually not that bad.  Only one song was really good, but the rest were so bad that it had nothing good to me.

The CD is not that bad and only one song was really good, but the rest were so bad that it could have been a Christmas album, but it isn't.  The CD is so bad that I don't know what to call it, a Christmas CD, a Christmas compilation album, or a Christmas CD compilation album.  I would rather listen to a Christmas album with better Christmas lyrics and better music than this CD.  I have heard other CDs with better Christmas music, and this one is a few notches below those CDs.  This CD is so bad that I don't know what to call it, but it is not Christmas music.  The CD is just a compilation of Christmas music.  The only good song on it is the song that starts off the CD.  It is not a good song, but it is a catchy one.  I think it should have been a single CD.  But even when the CD is just a compilation of Christmas music, it is still a good CD.  I am not saying that I like all the songs on the CD, but I think that one song was good enough to make me want to listen to the CD.  I don't know what to say about it, but it is a good CD.

Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous.

Niggy Jones - Black Smoke

I first heard this song on the radio (probably the early 90's). It was the first time I ever heard a song of this caliber, and it was a big hit! I bought the CD and was so disappointed when I saw it was only available for a limited time. I had to buy it as it was almost a piece of crap to have to listen to it over and over again! I knew that niggy will never have a new release so I bought the original and got this album. This is a great album and one of the best albums of the 90s. I highly recommend this album.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of a story I read in a children's Bible. It was a story I had not seen since I was a child. The story was about a Christmas Eve celebration in a poor man's home. The man was not a Christian but he and his wife prayed for a child. They prayed that the Lord would bless them in this new way. The night before Christmas the man heard an angel speaking to him in a dream. The man awoke and realized the angel was talking about his dream which was about a new life. The angel told him that he could not bring himself to tell his wife about it but that he would tell her in the morning. The next morning the man told his wife and she said she believed him. The man went to the store to buy some bread for his family. While he was gone the man's wife told the servant to go to the market. The servant found two coins that she had hidden in the corner of the kitchen, and brought them back to the man. The man's wife thanked the servant and said that she saw the coin. The story goes on to say that the man's wife went shopping that same day. She was the first to buy the bread. She realized she had been deceived by the servant and told him. The servant was so ashamed that he brought the coin to the man. The man was so angry that he threw the coin in the trash can. Then he went to the market to buy more bread. The man told the servant to go to the market and buy another coin. The servant went to the market and came back with two coins. The man's wife was not pleased. She told the servant to go to the market again. The servant went to the market and came back with two coins and asked if he could buy some more bread. The man's wife told him she did not want anymore. This time the servant took the coins into the kitchen and put them in the cupboard. The man's wife went to the market and bought the bread. The man thanked the servant and said he was the first to buy the bread.

This trio's creative contributions to the band during Jim Morrison's tenure were undeniably inspired: Ray Manzarek's unique, soulful, creative keyboard renditions, Robby Krieger's classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability, and John Densmore's understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history's greatest rock bands.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: I thought she was going to cry during the chorus, but then the next chorus starts, and she starts to sing it.  I don't know if it's the song or the singer's voice, but this song is more than a little irritating after the first couple of minutes.  It's pretty bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought it was a good song, but it seems like the song is a little off key.  This song is very easy to sing, yet there are parts that you have to pay attention to.  I can't help but be a little disappointed with this song.  I can't sing it.

Amazon review: I like this song, but it's not very good.  I expected it to be a song that you could sing and enjoy.  I can sing most of her other songs, but this one just doesn't do it for me.  It's a good song.  It's just that I don't really like it.  This song just doesn't do it for me.

Amazon review: The vast majority of this CD are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice. Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous. Overall this promises more than it delivers.

Amazon review: Listening to this CD, all the way through, was neither easy nor enjoyable.  If you like beat-driven "pop" with repetitious lyrical hooks, you might like '0304'.  If you are expecting to be touched by another excellent Jewel collection, prepare to have your heart broken.  This CD truly disappointed everyone I know who has heard it.  It is pure "pop" drivel.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have bought from Amazon and I have to say I was very disappointed. The track that started off with the most promise, "No More (Let Me Hold You) In The Arms Of The Man I Love," was just as uninspired as "The House Of The Rising Sun" and "Lonely People" were. The rest of the album was just a collection of filler that never had the spark to be memorable.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been. Every song on here is a winner, you've got the hits and the best of (almost) album tracks. But if Mowtown happens to read this please.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The songs are great, but the audio quality is so bad that I want my money back.  It it a static-filled, compressed mess and it's pretty hard to listen to.  Whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album.  Waiting for the remaster.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: I'm not quite sure what it is about this album, but I feel like it is something about the songs that is different.  The album is almost like a movie, with some serious music to go along with the serious storyline.  This may be because the music is that good.  The songs are varied, have a good amount of energy and are just a treat to listen to.  I would like to have heard more from the same producers who worked on the album, but I am glad that I got to hear the songs as they were and as they are now.

Amazon review: I've only heard of this album a few times, but it's a great album.  I love the song "My Heart" and I love the song "Wanna Make You Love Me."  "Wanna Make You Love Me" is Jewel's most popular song; this one takes it up a notch.  There is a lot of energy in this song and it really makes you want to dance.  I don't think "My Heart" is the best song on the album, but it is a great song.

Amazon review: This is Jewel's best album and it's got a lot more than the great songs on "Love, Let Me Be Your Fantasy."  "I Can't Wait" is the first song on the album and it is a great song.  It's almost like a ballad, but it's not, but it is a great song and I really like it.  "Love, Let Me Be Your Fantasy" starts off strong and is a great song but it gets old and some of the songs on the album are not worth listening to.  I would've liked to have heard more from the same producers who worked on this album, but I do rate this album with two stars.

Amazon review: This is one of the best Jewel albums.  I love the songs on this album, but I wish there were more songs on this CD.  I do give this album three stars because I feel like there are a lot of filler tracks.  I also give it three stars because there are a lot of good songs on this album.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this CD on the recommendation of my local music store.  The music on this CD is very dark.  I have not had any problems with it, but I did need it sooner than expected.  I like that the CD is in a jewel case, and the label does not have any printing errors.  I have had a CD that had all the printing errors of this CD, and I was very disappointed.  In fact, I think this CD is better than the ones I have been given by the store.  The music is very dark, and there is no "purity" to it.  The music is full of "groaning" undertones, and is extremely intense.  The music is not "rock & roll" like much of TSFH.  I like TSFH, but I think this album is not up to the standard of TSFH.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.

Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

Amazon review: This song is one of my favorites on this album, so I bought it when I heard it.  I downloaded the mp3 from the Internet and it is pretty good.  It's just overproduced and the way it is performed is not very good either.  I like the harmonies in it and it's nice to hear what someone is singing while listening to what's going on in the background.  It's a good mix of piano and singing.  It's just a little overproduced, but it's really easy to listen to.

"All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: This is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performances ever recorded.  The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.  I'm surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy; sounds like it was made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment.  This recording of the same performance is MUCH cleaner: http:/ www.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

When he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling.

Amazon review: Anne Murray is a singer that has to be heard to be believed! Her voice is so amazingly powerful in the songs like "The Girl with the Green Eyes", "Boys and Girls", and "The Long Hard Road". I agree, this was an amazing album from start to finish. I love the fact that she is an artist that has grown from the strength of her music, but I also love that she has such amazing talent that she can write songs like this without being a singer of any real ability. She has a way of putting words to a song that is so beautiful, and she does it so well that it is almost impossible to appreciate her songwriting without listening to the actual music. I've listened to this album several times and I still love it, and I don't intend on getting another one in this genre for a long time to come. I'm looking forward to hearing new material from her in the future!

Amazon review: I think this is her worst song ever. Blah! She is so talented, I can't fathom why she'd write such an incipid song as this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I picked up this cd after listening to some samples.  Very good, I enjoyed most every song, except "Carried by the Wind."  When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before.  I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE.  It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good song but just... well, just not my cup of tea.  I like Farish's version better and I'm afraid that I'm becoming a Farish fan as well, which is not a good thing.  I like the piano and Farish's voice on this one.  But, this song is just a bit too much.  I don't want to go back and listen to it and I really shouldn't have to.  I probably will though.  It's been a while since I've heard this song.  But, if you're a Farish fan, go check this one out.  I think it's good.  Just not for me.  I want to hear other Farish's too, though.  I'm definitely going to listen to this one again.  That said, I like it and I like Farish's voice, so I guess that it's fine.  But, it's just not for me.  And, I don't think that it's very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Farish's voice.  I usually don't like his stuff in general but there is just something about this one that I really like.  I like the piano in this one.  It's just a bit of a different sound from what I usually hear Farish doing.  This is just a little different.  I like it.  It's just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you're going to listen to this song, you might as well just listen to the whole cd, really.  I do like Farish's vocals, but this song just doesn't do anything for me.  I like the other songs on the cd, but this is just a tiny bit of filler.  This is a pretty good song though and it sounds like it's going to be an interesting one.  It sounds a lot like "If I Could Tell You" from Yanni's album.  I like the piano in this one.  I like the vocals and I like Farish's voice.  It's a good song, but it's just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: I just wanted to say that I really like Farish's voice.  I like the piano in this one.  It's just not my cup of tea.  It's a nice, pretty song, though.  I don't know... I just don't really like this song.  It's a bit of a filler.  There's nothing really worth noting here.  It's not an especially great song.  There's nothing really to like about this song.  It's just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: This song was really good.  It was almost like a Farish CD, for lack of a better word.  I heard it and thought, "That's really good."  Then, I listened to it and thought, "That's not that good."  But, it turned out to be a pretty good one, so I listened to it a bunch and thought that it was really good.  And, I liked it a lot.  I liked Farish's voice, and it really is a good song, so I think I'll probably pick up some more Farish stuff.  I like Farish's voice and it's a good song, so I'll probably pick up some more Farish stuff.  I love Farish!  So, that's where I'm going with this review.  :P  :P

Amazon review: Manakin Moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band Waxing Poetics, who were a regional favorite in the Norfolk, Virginia, area.  It's a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind.  Highly recommended.  Wannabe singers, just try to learn the lyrics on this one!

Amazon review: I have also been waiting for this cd for about 3 years now, and now that it is finally out. the anticipation is deffinatly worth it.  I love this cd, it is just as amazing as I had expected. it is awsome. It is good no matter what type of music you usually listen to. It is a combinaiton or hip hop, and metal. it is an awsome combination. It is funny, adn serious. so nomatter wht your mood is you will enjoy it. I think that this cd has just made my month.

Amazon review: This is a great album no doubt. The call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song I have ever heard. fade to black is an absolute classic. maybe missing a little balls though in this one.

Amazon review: I was surprised to hear that this song was released by another artist, but JMC's rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to Christian Kane's power ballad.  I would highly recommend folks go over to Christian's page here on Amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album "House Rules".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song "The Last Man On Earth" is really not for the faint of heart.  This is one of the longest songs I have heard. I don't know what the deal is, it is one of the more aggressive songs on the CD.  I would suggest that anyone who feels strongly about a particular song skip it.

Amazon review:  This is a terrible album.  "The Last Man on Earth" is so boring.  It sounds like a "bad" DM song.  It is like hearing a joke of a song and you are supposed to laugh at it.  "People Are People" is not a good song.  The lyrics don't mean anything.  The song is just a stupid song about how people are all alike.

The songs are really good, and if you do not like them, there is no point in listening to them.  I am not sure why people would be upset with this album, and I am glad I bought it.
