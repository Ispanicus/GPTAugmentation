Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is what we call a "smoke bomb" and you should know what to do with it.  This is just another one of those fake albums...too many people are buying it and not knowing the difference.  I am not buying this one.  I will stick with my favorites.  This is one of them.

Amazon review: I know a lot of people don't like this album but this album is what I had been waiting to hear for a good long time.  In truth it is probably the best album of the year and it is only the second album that I have ever bought myself.  I'm so glad I did.

Amazon review: This album is one of the best rockin' "hip-hop" albums ever.  I was not a fan of the rapper when he was on the mic but I love his flow and beats on "Don't You Worry Bout a Thing".  This album is good for any occasion!

Amazon review: This is what you get when you go and get Jay-Z on your computer.  I wish this would pop up on the radio more often but for some reason they have to play the crap out of the "realest" rap albums.  The beats are good but the lyrics for the most part are not too good.  They are a little repetitive with some good lyrics.  It's a good album but I'm sure in another 10 years I'll forget about it.  But it's still good.

Amazon review: This music is one of the best of the year.  I can't wait to see what the next album is.  I love the song "I got a feeling" more than anything.  I have to say that when I listened to the album I thought it was going to be all over the radio and I wasn't expecting it to be the same as the rest of the music out there.  I loved the song "I got a feeling" more than the rest of the album.  It is one of the best things I have ever heard.  I hope the next album is a lot better than the first...anyone have any idea what the next album is?

Amazon review: Not a bad album, just not my cup of tea.  It is a nice listen to, but I don't like the way she sings.  I would have liked to hear some more of her voice on the album.

Amazon review: This is a great album!  I enjoyed the songs, but really enjoyed the cover art.  I listen to a lot of rap music, but I prefer to listen to artist like Jay Z, Eminem and Nelly.  I'm glad I got this album.  It was worth it.  It is a great album.  I hope the next album is better.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album was a bit disappointing.  As a person who is a big fan of the artist, I felt like I was hearing something that I have never heard before from them.  I would say that there was a bit of a problem with the production of the album.  I guess it was the same problem with the song "I Got a Feeling".  The vocals were really well done.  I was surprised that they didn't try to get another artist

Amazon review: Wow, this is a great album. The first thing this is NOT is the most boring album I have ever heard. I think they are trying to create an album that is so deep into the history of Country, and they are doing a better job than most of what is out there. If this album is released in a year or two, I will be sure to buy it, with the exception of maybe the first few songs. The songs are just very catchy, and the album is very enjoyable.

Amazon review: I had the privilege of working with Bob Johnson and his wife, Ann, as the house manager for the year of 1985.  My duties were a variety of cleaning, cooking, washing, and general maintenance of the home and office.  I was very lucky to meet and work with two fine examples of true musicianship with the ability to sing or play the guitar.  The combination of Johnson and Johnson (Ann) was a wonderful combination of talent in their respective fields.  Bob was a master of harmony and a very good song writer.  Ann Johnson was a great singer and a superb guitarist.  I remember working with them in the home and how Ann Johnson could sing just about any song and Bob would play it like he wrote it.  Bob Johnson had an amazing gift for singing and playing the guitar.  Bob was the one who introduced me to the wonderful musical instrument, the guitar.  I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Bob Johnson and Ann Johnson as a house manager for the year 1985.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I just don't think they have any real new music on this disc.  They are good songs, but I don't think they have any real fresh new songs.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I have no problem with learning the language but if the teacher doesn't speak English, it doesn't really help the student.  I thought that many of the songs were very good, especially the ones on the end of the CD, but they did not really sound like a group of musicians; they sounded like a group of people that were just playing the songs that were on the CD.  I don't really like the sound that the CD makes.  The vocals are fine, however, I don't really like the way the songs sound because they sound like they were recorded by someone that has never heard music before, which is not very good.  I can understand that it's difficult to get the whole melody of a song without the accompaniment.  I don't know what the CD is about, but I don't want to waste my money on it because I don't know what it is.

A friend recommended this CD after listening to it. She said "the song "No One Knows" was the best song I've ever heard." I agree. I liked "The World Is Yours" a lot. It's a very catchy tune and has a nice beat. I think the lyrics were also cool. "We're all still getting older" is a nice line of thinking. I've always liked "What's Up In the Club" but it's just not a song I would sing out loud to a crowd. It was great to listen to, though.

Twiztid is a very unique sound that's been around for a long time. Twiztid is the first female rapper since the 90's. She has a very unique sound and sounds like she comes from another planet. After listening to this album I feel like I don't have to have a male rap to be able to listen to a song like "What's Up In the Club". She doesn't sound like a female rapper and her lyrics were very unique. I always enjoy listening to the female rapper's but Twiztid is definitley on my list.

Twiztid is an amazing artist, I've listened to quite a few of her albums and each one is very different from the other. Twiztid's album What's Up In The Club is a great example of that. The opening song, "What's Up In The Club" is a very fun song that gets the party going. The hook of the song is catchy and I always like the sound of a rap with a beat. The beat of the song is great and I really liked the sound of the music. "What's Up In The Club" is a really cool song that gets the party started for any party. Twiztid has a great flow and she definitely knows how to dance.

One of the best tracks is "No One Knows" because it's the first time I've heard Twiztid actually rhyme. It's a really fun song that has a great beat. Twiztid's lyrics were really great and I really liked the "don't know" part of "No One Knows". A lot of female rappers use that statement to get over other men. Twiztid uses it to talk about not knowing what love is. That statement was really good and made me think about some things that I've been thinking about lately. Twiztid's "No One Knows" is a great song and has a great beat.

Overall, Twiztid has an amazing sound and her style of music. She's always had a unique sound and is an amazing rapper. The only tracks on her album that I didn't like are "No One Knows" and "The World Is Yours". They're not bad songs, but they're not great songs either. I really liked "The World Is Yours" and "No One Knows" but they're not the best tracks on the album.

Overall Twiztid is an amazing artist that I would love to see more of. I think Twiztid has a lot of potential and could really be a huge star.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: If you haven't heard of this band, you're missing out!  This album is an outstanding release.  I've listened to it several times and I'm still amazed and amazed every time I listen to it, even after several years.  It's not an easy listen, but if you love rockabilly or folk, you're going to love them.  I love the song "I'm a King" because it is not only a great rockabilly song, but it is also a great folk song.  The opening song "Take Me a Little Bit Higher" is also a good rockabilly song with nice harmonies.  I also love the bluesy and folky songs on this album.  I just can't say enough good things about this band!  If you like folk and blues, this band is for you!

Amazon review: This is a great album, I listened to it a couple of times and it is one of my favorites of 2016.  This album is great for many reasons.  This band has one of the best voices in music today.  This band is a great live band and they are also good at singing the songs.  They are great at playing the songs and they are great at creating new songs.  This album is great for the blues lovers and fans of the blues and rockabilly.  I love this album and it is awesome.  I hope they release a new album soon.

Amazon review: This album is amazing!  I love everything about it!  It's hard to pick a favorite song, even though most of them are great.  "Let Me Down Easy" is my favorite song.  "We Gonna Get You Baby" is very cool.  I really like the way the band puts their emotion into the songs.  "Let Me Down Easy" is also one of my favorite songs.  "I Can't Stand the Rain" is a really cool song, the lyrics are great, and the band plays it really well.  I really like the band.  I am a fan.

Amazon review: This album has some great tracks, but not really enough good songs in their repertoire.  I think this album would be great if they could play more songs, but it's not going to happen because they only do a few songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In love with Libera's first two albums, but this, the third, is just a little too generic.  That's not to say the first two are awful, they are just not up to the standard of the other two albums.  I could not stand the repetitiveness and the lack of variety in this album.  I'm getting tired of hearing the same songs over and over again.  The worst part is that my wife is a fan of the band and has been listening to this CD for months straight.  It seems that she loves the music and I don't.  I'm going to pass on the album, in hopes that the next album has more of a variety.  In the event that the next album comes out before the current one, I will buy it for her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  So far the album has been a disappointment (as I've said before).  The band has a lot of good, but not great talent as far as I can tell.  As with all of their other albums, the singing is pretty good, but the execution is not up to par.  I don't understand what the point of the album is.  I'm not going to buy it, but I don't plan on downloading it either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't think the album would be this bad but it has been.  This album just sounds generic and doesn't have any unique qualities except the music.  The vocals are annoying and the singing is just repetitive.  I feel like I'm listening to a band trying to sound like a group called Bluegrass and it just doesn't work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is definitely on the generic side.  I'm not sure if they are trying to sound generic or not, but it just doesn't sound like a band that tries to sound like a band.  Maybe it is a band trying to sound like a generic band and it is a failure, but whatever it is, it just isn't good.  If you are a fan of bluegrass and folk, or even country, this album can't be that bad.  It is just a generic pop-country album.  The best part is that it is only 2 CDs.  That's it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't listened to any music from this band in a while, so I am glad to have a chance to listen to anything they have to offer.  I have to say that this album is not up to par.  The band is great, but it just doesn't have any individuality.  Their music is so generic and just doesn't sound like anyone else.  The vocals are okay, but nothing special.  I really don't like this band.  The album is boring and repetitive.  I think the band is trying to copy the band called Bluegrass, but it just doesn't sound like anyone else.  I think they should put more variety in their music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This band is not anything special, but the music is very good.  At first, I didn't like the band because I thought they sounded like a generic bunch.  However, after the first album, I realized that this band is better than this band.  The band is good, but they should put more variety in their music.  If I were to listen to this album, I would listen to it like a total newbie.  They have a good sound, but there is nothing else to say about this band except for their good music.

I'm not sure what the point of the CD is.  I'm looking forward to the next CD.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Cincinnati rock/country band, The Fuzztones. I have liked the sound of this band for a long time. When I found out they had an album, I was excited. Of course, I had to order it from Amazon. I can say that I wasn't disappointed. It is a very interesting new band. Their sound is different and has a different feel from other rock bands. The band's sound is more blues like and a bit more acoustic. They sound like they are having fun (which is something that is hard to think of when you hear their sound). They have a great variety of songs that will make you feel like you are in a real rock/country band. If I had to take any advice, I would say listen to their albums and get the albums that are out now (i.e. Love Like Your Love). I am currently listening to the third album: Out From The Cold (2003) and it really is a great album.

I have heard of this band before, but not really. I saw them live once, and they were great. The band is from Kentucky, but is based out of Cincinnati, Ohio. The band features a great array of vocalists and musicians. They have a great range of musicians. Their songwriting is very good. The band has a very unique sound. The band is very well known for their live shows. The band is very energetic and fun. The band is very well known for the great live shows. The band has been together for about 20 years, and have only released one full length album. I am really enjoying the band's music, and look forward to much more music. I have seen them play a lot, and I hope that I will see them play a lot more.

I first heard of this band from a radio station in Ohio. The band did a live show at a local coffee shop in Cincinnati. The band was very excited about touring, and they were very eager to start touring. The band is a very active band. They have played many shows since they started. This band has a great variety of songs. The band is very young. The band is very active. The band is very energetic. The band has a great variety of songs

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The CD has a nice variety of styles and I've enjoyed many of the songs.    I listen to this CD several times during the day and at night, but I still don't find the songs repetitive.  As a matter of fact, the songs seem to me to be very original and not influenced by other music.  I have also enjoyed the liner notes and the information about Libera.  I love the fact that Libera is from the Netherlands, and he is a fantastic musician.  I hope this CD will be as successful as the other two.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs by the great composer, John Adams.  The album contains original music by Adams that has long been the subjects of music scholars and students.  The recordings are all in stereo.  The tracks are arranged with Adams in mind, yet are musically diverse.  Adams has written over 300 songs and it is a feat to hear them all together.    The album is not overproduced, but it is very well recorded with clear audio and well balanced between the male and female vocals.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very good. I have loved the album since I first heard it.    I have been to the Netherlands many times, and the country is very beautiful.  The people are friendly, and you can enjoy the music and have a good time.    I have purchased many albums of John Adams and heard all of them and always enjoyed them.  This album is no exception.  Great work. I have recommended this album to everyone I know who loves John Adams and his music.

Amazon review: I have been enjoying the music of John Adams and have purchased several of his albums.  I have purchased this CD in the past because I have heard it on the internet and was not familiar with it.  I have seen that it is a great CD, but not so great that I cannot listen to it.  The CD is beautiful, with lots of well-recorded, full sound.  It has a good harmonic structure and is not too complex or repetitious.  The music is very well sung.  I would like to listen to this CD more often and to purchase it as well.

Amazon review: I have not yet heard this CD, but after listening to several of the tracks that I have available, I am amazed at the quality of the recording.

Amazon review: The last album I purchased from Schubert was "Schubert Lieder".  I was so excited to hear this CD.  The music is beautiful, the songs are lovely, and the recording is superb.  I was so happy that this CD had been reissued by Schubert, because I have had a long-standing interest in the music and have purchased many of Schubert's masterpieces.  I am happy to hear that I am not the only one.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I first heard  this band when I was going through a rough time in my life and needed something to  help me through it.

Amazon review: The last and final album they released.  They had just come out of seclusion without a label.  This album had all the songs from their previous albums plus a few new songs.  It showed their development from their first album.  This is the end of an era.  They had to leave the scene.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album a while back.  I got it as a gift from a friend and  I have to say I am very pleased with the product.  I have to say that the lyrics of the first song in the album,  "The Road Is Long" is one of the best ones that I have heard all year.  I really wish that there was a female counterpart to this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band for a long time and  I have to say that this is one of my favorite albums.  Its hard to pick just one song, but this one  is the one that has come to be my favorite of all time.  I loved the album and everything about it. It was a must buy.  I would have reccomend it to anyone who is interested in the band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is a good album, but one that sounds like a bunch of rappers.  They were all well-known rappers with a few unknowns and  it did not really have any new music, just rehashes and old songs.  I was really disappointed at first, but it has grown on me.

Amazon review: It is a very good album, but it is a bit over hyped by some.  The main reason I bought it was because I thought it would be a fun way to get back in touch with my friends from the past.  The lyrics are well-written and  I really enjoyed the music, but I have to say I am a little disappointed in the vocals.  They are not bad, but they just don't sound like the rest of the band.  They are very pop-ish with a big band sound but nothing that really stands out in a positive way to me.  I would say if you are looking for pop music,  this is not it.  It is just a bit of a waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album over and over and  over.  I've bought it twice and I will buy it again.  Everytime I listen to it I think that the music is better than the last time.  There is something to be said about the band, but the lyrics of some of the songs are just not very good.  The songs that has stuck with me the most are  "The Road Is Long" and "Pilot".  I would buy it again for the same reasons as always.  I am not disappointed.

Amazon review: I was looking for some type of music to listen to while doing some work.  I have searched the net for a while now and  I have found a very interesting band.  They sound like classic rock, but they have an amazing sound.  They have a way of blending their music with the words that they say.  I love the way they describe the world around us.  They have a way of making me feel happy and at the same time make me feel sad.

Amazon review: I was looking for something to listen to for a while.  I am not sure what it was but  I liked the music. It's a little different from what I usually listen to.  I like how it's not so loud and at the same time still manages to keep the music going.  It's not a CD, but it's very good.  It's not a bad album, but it's not the best.  I would buy it again if I like it again

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I am sure the recording was made at the Naxos recording studio in Hollywood California with the utmost care and attention to detail. I would have to say that the recording was flawless and that the recording was better than what I will ever get in a recording studio. This is a must-have for any opera lover.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great piece of music that will make you want to learn the aria. The recording is very good and the conductor is very good.

Amazon review: I am not sure what to make of this recording, but it is worth your while to listen to it, if you have not already. What was so bad about it?

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the recording the last few years (aside from the obvious technical issues with the recording) and I still find it a very enjoyable recording.

If you want a good recording, it is worth your while to purchase this one.

Amazon review: This is the first recording of the opera I have listened to since it was performed on the Naxos label in the 1970's. I had high hopes for this recording, but I was not disappointed.

This is a must have for opera lovers, especially those who are looking for a recording of the aria "Wenn wir dicht zusammen" from Act 2 of "Lohengrin."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This Naxos recording is of the aria "Wenn wir dicht zusamme" in Lohengrin. The recording is excellent, but I did not like the recording of the other arias. They are a little short with the sound. I would have a 4 star rating if the other arias were not included in the recording.

I would have a 3 star rating if the other arias were not included in the recording (which they are not).

Amazon review: What a great CD!  I bought this over at a local music store a few weeks ago.  I just wish I could have bought it at the time it was released, but I was busy working and couldn't find the time.  I'd have been happy with this CD.  I liked all the tunes on this CD, but I especially liked "The Loner" the most.  I was a little surprised that they didn't play the song "The Loner" live, after they played it on the cd.  The live version is a little slower but still cool.  The band plays like they are in their 40's.  They also have a great cover of "The Loner" by The Who.  I just wish I had bought this album back in the day when I was in the right place and time to get at CD or vinyl.  I'm glad I did.  If you are a fan of this group check out the CD.

Amazon review: I bought the reissue of this CD (I forgot the artist).  I was really glad this album was still in print.  I really don't know what I was expecting after listening to this album for the first time.  I was expecting a lot of the same stuff that was on the first disc and some of the same tunes, but I was very surprised to hear so many new tunes.  I've listened to this album over and over again and I still like it very much.  I thought a lot of the songs would have gotten better as I listened to them more; but they stayed the same after the first time I listened to this CD.  I'm hoping that they will get better as I continue to listen to them.

Amazon review: I have never in my life heard anything so bad.  The only good song on this is 'I Found You'.  The rest are just awful.  They have a cover of "The Loner" by The Who.  They also have a cover of "My Little Corner of the World" by The Beatles.  The band is extremely unoriginal, and their playing is terrible.  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this CD.  I'm glad I haven't heard it.  I don't know how they can call themselves a band.  They sounded terrible on the cd.  I will not be getting the album.  I'm not trying to defend the band; I just don't know why anyone would listen to them.

I mean, what's the point?  It's just a bad cd.  I'll buy the cd when I hear it on a bootleg.  I will never listen to any of their music again.  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this cd.  I should have just thrown it away.

I am sure some of you have already seen this review and I am not going to repeat the information (as if you have already seen it).  However, I would like to give you a little perspective on the whole thing.
I have been listening to this music for more than two decades and I have heard this album about ten times.  I have not been able to get over the fact that I have heard this album ten times and have never heard anything like it.  I have not been able to get over the fact that many of the songs are from the early 80s.  I have not been able to get over the fact that I never once heard this album until four months ago.  I have not been able to get over the fact that I only had the CD in front of me for less than ten minutes.  The most important thing I have been able to get over is the fact that I have not been able to get over the fact that I have not been able to get over the fact that this album was the only one I had not heard in over ten years.
I have been listening to this music since I was a child.  I have never heard anything like it.  I have not been able to stop listening to this music.  I have not been able to stop thinking about this music.  I have not been able to stop finding out about this music.  I have not been able to stop discovering this music.  I have not been able to stop being interested in this music.  I have not been able to stop being drawn to this music.
I have listened to this album in my car, on my plane, in a cafe, on a train, in a pub, in a restaurant, on a cruise ship, while riding in a taxi, while riding in a cab, while riding in a bus, while riding in a train, while riding in a boat, while eating a breakfast burrito, while eating a bowl of cereal, while standing in line at the grocery store, while standing in line at the bank, while standing in line at the doctor's office, while standing in line at the post office, while standing in line at the dry cleaners, while standing in line at the dry cleaners, while standing in line in the lobby of the hotel, while standing in line in the lobby of the motel, while standing in line at the library, while standing in line at the library, while standing in line at a movie theater, while standing in line at the movie theater, while standing in line at the grocery store before the checkout, while standing in line at the grocery store before the checkout, while waiting in line at the grocery store, while waiting in line at the grocery store, while waiting in line for a bus, while waiting in line for a bus, while waiting in line for the mail, while waiting in line at the post office,
