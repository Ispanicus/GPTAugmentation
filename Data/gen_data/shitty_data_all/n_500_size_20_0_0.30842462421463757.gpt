Amazon review: Billy Currington's album is great. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Billy is going to become one of the top artists in the next few years. Every one should buy this album!

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Oh, so you want me to sing in a rock band?  I'm flattered, but I've never sang with my band in public.  The songs are fine, the vocals are good, and the guitar is decent, but it's not a band.  It is a CD of pop songs, and they are pretty good songs.  But, they are not good rock songs.  So, as you can see, this isn't a good purchase.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is awesome!  This is like if you took a pile of good songs and made a band out of it.  It seems to have a lot of talent and a lot of personality.  I wish I had found this record at the right time.  I would have bought it!

Amazon review: This is the best rock album in a long time!  The songs are great.  The guitar playing is really good.  The bass is also great.  The vocals are strong.  The lyrics are the best.  You won't be able to stop singing along the whole album.  It is really good!  I have been listening to it for about 30 minutes and I am still singing.

Amazon review: I know, I know...  Sooooooo good.  What a lot of effort to make this record.  It is a nice combination of different styles of music.  It has a lot of great music, but a lot of it is very hard to find in stores.  Very hard to find in stores.  So, I decided to make my own cd.  I know, this sounds like a bad idea, but I wanted to show people that if you know how to use a computer, you can easily make a cd.  It was so easy.  I am very happy with the result.  It is good.  You won't be disappointed.  If you like rock and roll, you will love this.  If you don't like rock and roll, you won't like this.  If you like soul music, you will like this.  If you like hard rock music, you will like this.  If you like country music, you will like this.  If you like blues music, you will like this.  This is one great record.  I love it!  I don't know how to describe it.  It is hard to put into words.  It is like a dream that you can't seem to wake up from.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  I know that there will be people that don't like it, but they won't be able to stop singing along.  The best song is the first song when it starts.  "The best day of my life" is the second best song on the cd.  I love a good party.  I mean it.  The cd is a good record.  I'm not trying to be funny, I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I'm just stating a fact.  This is a really good cd.  I would like to see a band with a lot of talent and a lot of personality.  I would like to see a band that is a lot like Billy.  He has a good style, but he is a good songwriter.  I would like to see a band that is loud and a lot like his band.  I am a big fan of country music.  I would like to see a band that is like the Eagles.  I would like to see a band like the Rolling Stones.  I would like to see a band that is like the Beatles.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

The only song I would take issue with would be the last song "You Are My Sunshine",  I feel the vocals are a bit over-emotive and not what the song is about.  I still enjoyed it, but this is definitely a personal opinion.  It can be easily skipped, too.

You can either listen to the songs or skip them, or you can skip the songs and listen to the whole CD, or you can skip the CD and listen to the songs.  You can listen to the songs, skip them, then listen to the CD, skip the CD, listen to the songs, etc.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: This album is a real throw back to your favorite days of Slipknot.  I remember them playing these songs on the road.  This album is still good, even if it is not as good as the previous two.

Amazon review: I like that they went with a different sound than the bands previous two albums.  Although the songs are the same I feel like they may have just changed the producer or something.  It's still a great album.  But I do think this would have been a better album if it was not all written by Corey.  It's a shame because I really liked it.  I'm glad I got it.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that the album seems to be a mixture of songs from the first 2 Slipknot albums and the songs from the 3rd.  But I can't think of anything else.

Amazon review: Slipknot is a four-piece band with a heavy, aggressive, guitar-driven sound. The first three albums in the band's career were solid, if not quite as successful. With the release of their much-anticipated record, "All Hope Is Gone,' it’s clear that the bands’ fans have been waiting for an evolution of Slipknot. Even though it’s not a perfect album, it still stands as a solid follow up to the band’s more successful works.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a hardcore fan of Slipknot ever since I saw them in the late 90's.  I was very lucky and got a copy of the EP "All Hope Is Gone" which was released on July 11, 2004.  I did not expect this album to be as good as the first one.  I was not disappointed at all.  I thought that this album would be very similar to the previous two but it was not.  I like the fact that they went with a different sound than the bands previous two albums. However, I do think that this would have been a better album if it was not all written by Cory.  It's a shame because I really liked it.  I thought this album was very good.  I didn't care about the lyrics much because I didn't really like the rest of the songs.  I liked the fast paced stuff and the slower songs.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album cover to cover.  I could listen to it over and over again.  It's so heavy, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the whole album.

Amazon review: This CD was released in the summer of 2004.  I first got it when I got the EP "All Hope Is Gone."  I loved this album.  I was very surprised at how much I liked this album.  This is the first time that I've had a Slipknot album that I didn't have to re-listen.  I think that this album is going to be huge.  It's just a masterpiece.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think that this album is better than the first two.  It takes the listener to another place.  It's still really heavy but now it's not just heavy metal.  It's more of a rock type of album.  This is the second album with Corey and it's still good.  It's just a shame that this album is so bad.  I think it's going to get a lot of love.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: This is a beautiful CD.  The first two tracks are fantastic.  The organ adds wonderful color and texture to the music.  The 3rd track is just a little too much for my personal taste, but I will listen to it again.  The 6th track is one of my favorites on the CD.  The 7th track is also a favorite and is a bit too much for my personal taste.  This CD is a wonderful addition to the collections of any fan of organ music.  I will keep this CD for a long time.

Amazon review: The music of this release is unique.  It does not sound at all like any other organ record.  However, there are some things that I feel are missing.  The overall effect is a bit too dark.  The last track, "Ave Maria", sounds like a church organ, but it is not.  It has a very heavy organ sound.  If you are an organ player, you will notice that there is no reissue from the recording of "Ave Maria" (except for the CD that is included).  A reissue is in order because people would like to hear the original recording.  I would like to hear the original recording of "Ave Maria".  I would like that too.

It is not the best recording of "Ave Maria", but it is an excellent recording.  The organ is a wonderful addition to the music.  The organist is a very talented and accomplished organist.  He also has the talents to record his own music.  I would recommend this recording to any organist.

My name is Jeff and I work for a small company in the financial industry. I am a music fan, I am not just an organist fan. I play several instruments, but I mainly play the organ. I also play flute, trumpet, and guitar.

I first heard some organ music in the early 90's in a church in the Philippines. I was in a choir and the organist was performing a piece that I had never heard before. I was awestruck. I remember playing the piece for him and asking him how he had arranged the music. He replied that he had arranged it himself. After that he played it to us. I was not sure what to make of it, but I have a great memory so I have no doubt he did it the way he wanted to play it.

The next time I heard the music was on a trip to the Philippines where I visited a church. It was the same church I first heard the music in, but this time was even more amazing. The organist was performing another piece, but this time it was more like a concert. He was playing it in a very traditional way and the church was filled with people. The congregation was singing it, and I was stunned when I heard the organist's interpretation. We played it several times and the congregation and the entire church was singing it. I did not know that the organist could do that.

That was the first time I heard organ music and I fell in love with it. I went back to the Philippines to study organ, and then to Germany to study music. I studied with a master organist, but I returned to the Philippines to study with another master organist. I also went to Germany to study with a master flute player.

The rest of the years I played flute, trumpet, and guitar, and I was on the organist's choir. I also studied with another master organist. I have been fortunate to travel to over ten different countries in the world. I have learned more about organ music and I have listened to the music of all these different masters.

One day I was in Germany and I had a chance to hear the music of a master organist who played in a church in Germany. He played a very complicated piece that he had composed and arranged himself. The music was amazing. He told me that he had learned to play it by watching a master who played it himself. I was amazed that someone would watch another person to learn how to play music. I also

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

"My Heart Will Go On," a beautiful song from the Broadway musical, "Once On This Island," is an ode to love and heartache. When the song begins, the narrator tells us the story of his love for a woman, and how that love is now gone. It is a love so deep and unconditional that it will never die, and the narrator will never forget about it. While the narrator is at his wedding, he hears a song, "My Heart Will Go On," and it brings him back to the time of his love. This song is about the kind of love that can last through the years, and the love that can give people the will and the strength to carry on without the love that they once had.

I bought it but didn't listen to it yet. Then when I listened to it, I fell in love with it. I got it when I was at the theatre and I was so disappointed that I didn't get to listen to it on the way home, so I thought to myself, "I will read the reviews" and I thought "I will get it at the bookstore". I was so glad that I did, because this is the best score I have ever heard...The soundtrack is great, the songs are great and the performances by the actors are top notch. And the songs themselves are phenomenal. The main reason I wanted this soundtrack was because I was looking forward to seeing the movie. But when I heard the songs performed by the movie actors, I got goosebumps. They all had such different voices, and they all did a great job. I can't wait to listen to the movie too. This soundtrack is definitely going to be one of my favorites of all time.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is.

She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

From the reviews and ratings, it is obvious that white boys are in the majority. I'm not sure why, but I have a feeling the majority of people who like white boys are white males who are not true fans.  Just because a white boy is white doesn't mean he has the same tastes in music as the average white boy.

I'm not saying white boys are better than black boys, or vice versa.  I'm saying white boys are white boys.  They might be better than black boys, but they're not better than anyone else.

Amazon review: Love this song. Start my day out with it.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Well if you were looking for a song that really gets your brain going this is the song for you.  This has got to be one of the most inspiring songs ever.  I am going to take this as a sign that I need to stop eating and start writing.  Thanks for the download.

Amazon review: I have been thinking about this song for a long time.  I thought about it a lot last year when I was in the hospital.  I found the lyrics while they were playing the song for me.  In fact, I found the song on my iPod.  What's cool about this song is that it was written in the 60's.  I read something that said John Lennon wrote a song in the 60's that was still current when he wrote it.  I don't know about that but I do know that this is a great song.  I will have to listen to it and try to remember the lyrics.  I hope it doesn't get stuck on my iPod.  I think I will never get tired of hearing this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm sure I will find this song on someones iPod but I don't listen to music all that often.  I am a bit of a music snob.  I like good music that has a message or something to teach you or show you something.  This song is perfect for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review.  I love this song.  There is a great message here.  It says don't listen to your old friends, your old ideas, your old beliefs.  Don't settle down to the ways of the world.  Look around you, look at the world around you, and change it.  If you don't like it, change it.  Don't let the world convince you it's okay to be bad.  It's not alright.  It's not okay to be a pig.  It's not okay to be a pig.  It's okay to be a man.  It's okay to be a man.  It's okay, it's okay to be a man.  It's okay to be a good man.  It's okay to be a good man.  It is okay to be a man.
