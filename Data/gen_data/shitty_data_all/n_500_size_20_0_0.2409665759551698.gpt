Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I think its a good album, but I think it's kind of boring.. I don't know why people say they're good, but I like a lot of them.
I like the way that there are not many songs on the album that are totally unlistenable, like 'I wanna go back to the city' or 'I hate my life'

I always thought that they were just good for the moment, but I don't know much more about them. I just think they have a good sound and they are good for the moment. I think they should be better.

This is a great album, if you dont like rap, you shouldnt like this album.
It reminds you of the old days and the old music.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, but I have to say that it definitely doesn't live up to the hype I was hearing online. I'm not going to tell you which songs are good, because each individual track doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard before. I've heard this album before, but not this way.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've heard of a lot of "metalcore" bands in the past, but have been a BOC fan since the day Korn was formed. I listened to the first album many times and became a permanent fan. I have a strong connection to every member of the band and the way they interact with each other and God. This album was an extension of the band's message of love and peace.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's a great album, but with the addition of "In Temptation" from their last album, it's just more of the same. I don't know how the band even got away with this album, as it's definitely an attempt at something new, but it's not anything special.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a huge fan of BOC before their break-up.  I've listened to both albums since their reformation and I still love them. I love that they take their inspiration from the gospel, and I really loved the lyrics of this album.  With a couple of exceptions, I absolutely love this album. I would recommend this album to anyone, especially those who are in a heavy metal band and are looking for a change in their sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album so many times over the past few months, and I really wanted to like it. I really loved Korn back in the day, but after hearing 'This is Your Sword', I was ready to move on and find something new. I was going to give this album a 5 star rating, but when I first heard it, I couldn't put it down. It's a great album, and I can't wait for the next one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure why it had to take me so long to write this review.  This album is just plain bad.  I guess I'm just a sucker for the hype.  I bought this album a month or so ago, and listened to it over and over again.  I have listened to it a lot, and I can't believe it.  I think I'm going to call BS on this review and say that I'm still a BOC fan.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of BOC, but after listening to "This is Your Sword", I realized how much I appreciated the band.  I'm glad I listened to this album.  I listened to it over and over again.  It's a great song, and I'm glad I found it.  I'm not sure why it took me so long to write this review, I guess I was just in a rut.  I don't know why I didn't write this review sooner.  I feel like I'm cheating myself.  I guess this is a sign of the end of my obsession with them.  I'm sure I'll be back for more once they start doing a new album.

Amazon review: This is not a bad album, but I just can't get into it.  The only songs that I like are the ones with the lead vocals, but the rest just seem like a generic metalcore album.  I also don't think they could be bothered to put out a BOC album for me to hear, because I've heard them almost every year for the last 10-15 years.  I'm sorry to say that I don't want to listen to this album, but I don't know what else to say.  I suppose I should say that I do really like "Black and White" and "This is Your Sword".  I love the chorus of the latter song.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: The lyrics are not a problem. the message is a problem. The message is, "I love you baby, but I love my baby more."  They know that by now, but do they care?  I have always loved Prince's music, and I'm thrilled to be able to listen to his most recent album in its entirety, but I'm not sure what to make of this re-issue.  I loved the first time I heard it.  I just wish they'd released it in a double CD jewel case instead of a box with plastic pieces of paper on the inside.  (And a CD case.)  It would probably be much easier to open.

I'm sorry I am always a little critical of a lot of his work because I am not nearly as much of a fan as I should be, but I really like this album.  It's just a little short, but if you are short on space and need something to listen to, this is a great choice.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: The guy was a drunk and his wife was a junkie, but they really seemed to love each other.  He wasn't the best singer or musician, but he was a great actor.  I can't think of a lot of times when I've seen a decent singer or musician make a better impression on me.  Josh Groban is an excellent singer and musician.  He's also a very good actor.  He can't act, but he can sing.  He is very well-spoken.  He has a wonderful personality and he's very charming.  He is very good-looking and he is very good-looking.  The only negative point I can see is that he sounds like he's drunk on most of the tracks, but he didn't actually drink very much.  He sounded drunk on "I Can't Wait".  He sounded drunk on "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me".  He sounded drunk on "I'm Gonna Love You Forever".  He sounded drunk on "I'm the Only One Who Can."  He sounded drunk on "All the Way Home".  He sounded drunk on "I'm Gonna Love You Forever."  He sounded drunk on "I'm the Only One Who Can." He sounded drunk on "All the Way Home".  He sounded drunk, but he didn't actually drink very much.

Amazon review: I don't know whether it was the sound of the new album, or the fact that I'm not a fan of Josh Groban, but this CD was really hard to get into.  I've listened to it once or twice and was totally not interested, but I don't know why!  I don't think I could sing a note, but that's because I don't believe I have a very good voice!  I'm not a fan of Josh Groban.  I did like "I'm Gonna Love You Forever" and "I'm the Only One Who Can", but I was never able to get into the songs until I tried to sing along.

Amazon review: Josh Groban is an excellent singer and musician.  I couldn't help but be reminded of my first love for him, Josh Groban, as I listened to this CD.  He has such a wonderful voice and is so, so, so, so, so, so attractive!  I enjoyed hearing him sing "All the Way Home".  I enjoy his singing, but I can't help but think that he is too much of a perfectionist.  I've often wondered how he can sing a song that seems so perfect and it sounds like it was recorded by a machine.  The good thing about his voice and his singing is that he doesn't seem to be a perfectionist and he doesn't seem to try to sing a song perfectly.  His delivery is so natural, and is so, so, so, so, so, so, fun!

I don't think I like his voice and I don't like the songs, but I will continue to listen to him until he stops being so annoying.  I think he is a great singer and a great musician.

From I Love A Man In Uniform: A Tribute To The Songs of The Beach Boys

This is a CD of music from the Beach Boys recording sessions in 1965.  The tracks are all different versions of the same song.  They are all sung by Michael Nesmith (or sometimes, it's Mary Wilson).  It is interesting to hear how the Beach Boys changed the vocal style to suit their music.  They were trying to become more "pop" than they were becoming, and they thought that singing rock 'n roll would be more fitting for them.  They tried a lot of rock 'n roll techniques on their early records, but they wanted to go back to the old timey sound.  They eventually went back to the Beach

I have been listening to this band since they were called the Lushs.  They are some of the best bands out there.  They have some great albums, but this is by far the best by far.  Their lyrics, vocals and music are all exceptional.  No artist should be allowed to write about anything under the sun.  Mountain Home is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  I am a fan of all their music, and I have listened to this album a lot this year.  It's a great starting point to start off with.  The vocals are really great, and the music is very nice.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: They got their shit together and made a pretty good album.  Don't get me wrong, I love their sound, it's just their musical style was different than what I had grown accustomed to from them.  I felt like I was listening to a more modern country band.  I will admit I have a couple of songs that made me wish I had more time with them.  But, overall, I really enjoyed listening to this album.  And, I really hope they get back to their roots and find a more traditional country sound.

Amazon review: I think this album is the end of an era.  As a country music fan and a country music novice, I was pretty shocked when I first discovered this band.  I had never heard of this band and honestly had no idea who they were.  They were really great and I was really surprised at the quality of this album.  I really liked the lyrics, I was really into the song "Wasting My Time".  And the song "I'm Gonna Miss You" was beautiful.  I feel like Country Music is in great hands at the moment.  The Country Music Hall of Fame is going to have to be very careful about who they consider for induction.  I am really glad Billy Currington and Kenny Chesney are not considered.  They are truly at the top of a great and wonderful band.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album yet, but I am really excited about it.  I love songs that are upbeat and upbeat songs on an album that sounds like a radio station from the late 70's.  You will be able to tell this is an album that is going to be played on the radio.  The production is of course, not the greatest.  But this is a great country album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: His vocals are too modern country. The songs are depressing and mundane. They are all too similar. It just goes on for too long.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.
