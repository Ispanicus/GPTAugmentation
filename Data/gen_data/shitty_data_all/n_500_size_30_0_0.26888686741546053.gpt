Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I recently bought this CD and I am so glad I did.  I've heard many of the critics comments about this album and I have to agree with most of them.  This is not one of the better GNR albums, but it is not one of the worst either.  I bought this as a gift for my 9 year old niece, who is a huge GNR fan and I thought it would please her.  Boy was I wrong.  My niece is a good kid, but she is not one of those kids that listen to music or watch music videos all day long.  For her this is the first time she has heard any GNR songs and she is hooked for life.  The album did not disappoint, it sounds excellent, the lyrics are well written and meaningful, the production is top notch, it just simply does not fall into the GNR shadow, the production is much more than just "all blues" it features a lot of hard rock, heavy metal and even a little punk rock, the music is not only blues, but also a little heavy metal, with a big dose of soulful ballads and a lot of fun.  This is a great CD.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have heard a GNR album in its entirety. I have never heard a GNR album in it's entirety. I am amazed by the talent of the band, especially the song "Happiest Day Of My Life." I love the band because they can rock out and sing at the same time. They are truly talented and their music is extremely enjoyable. I would recommend this album as it is the only GNR album I have ever heard that I really enjoyed.

Amazon review: I just heard this cd for the first time last night and I have to say I'm not really a GNR fan like a lot of people are.  For me they are all kind of average.  I really like "Happiest Day Of My Life" and "Turn It Up."  I guess I really like their ballads where they can't be a rock band.  I like the songs but I don't think they are that great.

Amazon review: I agree with you the first time I ever heard this cd and I still like it.  But I'll tell you what, I really enjoyed the 2nd one, I even like the last one just as much, but the first album is definately the best, I liked the first one a lot.  It's a very solid cd.  The only thing I don't like is the ballads, like the last one.  It's just one of those things where you have to really like the album to really notice them, but it's not a big deal either really.  They are good songs.  If you don't like them, don't listen to the cd.  I think they are good songs.  It's just a matter of preference.  I like it a lot.  I think it's just a matter of preference, it's all subjective.  I like it a lot.

Amazon review: I downloaded this album and have just begun listening to it.  I am not a fan of most of this band's music.  I usually listen to the radio more often then I do the radio.  I like all of the songs on this CD, except for the one that I would rate lower.  I would rate the other album the best of the six.  I find the other albums boring.  I like that the music on this CD is very good.  The only thing that makes this CD a little boring is the fact that there is not much other music in the background. The other songs are very good, I just wish there was more.  I guess I could listen to the other albums, but I don't like them.  They are very boring to me.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I purchased and downloaded this album because I could not find another album with the same title, and it sounded good. I was disappointed after I only listened to the first song, "I'll Try Anything." I found the other songs to be very repetitive and uninteresting. The lyrics are interesting, but the songs just sounded the same. I would not recommend this album.

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this album cuz it is called "Country Legends". I am a country fan. The CD was a little scratchy, but I still enjoyed listening to it. There was no special "magic touch" to this album. I would rate it 3 stars because the songs are ok, but the songs are not that great. They just dont inspire me to listen to them every day. I would recommend it to people who like country music. If you are a country fan and like a collection of your favorite songs, then this album is a must-have. If you are a country fan and dont like a collection of your favorite songs, then you will not like this album.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I downloaded this CD to play when my friends are visiting me.  It was pretty good, but I don't think this will be my #1 album.  I like the songs, but the singing is horrible.  The vocals are weak, and the drumming is terrible.  The lyrics are good, but the melody is horrible and the lyrics are not meaningful to me at all.  The "clap" at the end of each song is the only reason I give this album 1 star.  Other than that, I really liked it.  I don't know why this is not like David Lee Roth's "Heart Shaped Box" by the same name.  I have listened to it many times, so that's why I give this one a 1.

Amazon review: This album is great.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't sound like "St. Anger." Not that it doesn't sound like David Lee Roth, but that it didn't sound like "Heart Shaped Box."  I like the sound, and I think it could be great, but it lacks a lot of the talent that made "Heart Shaped Box" a standout album.  Of course, I'm biased, as I thought David Lee Roth was an amazing singer, but I am not sure that I would have given this album 2 stars if it were not for the lack of talent in the singing and the poor production.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Although, I did not hear the whole song, I could tell it was a lot of work and I had a good feeling after listening to it.

The World's Greatest Hits by The Cure (1987)
The World's Greatest Hits by The Cure (1987) is a collection of songs from their first album, The Cure, along with some of their most popular songs. The songs are all very well-produced and are very enjoyable to listen to. The album starts off with The Cure's hit "The Love Cats" before they move on to other tracks, including "Lullaby", "Love Song" and "The World's Greatest Hits". The album features guest vocals from Patti Smith, who sings "The World's Greatest Hits" and "Puppy Love".

The World's Greatest Hits by The Cure (1987)
From the opening with "The Love Cats" to the closing with "God" and "Lullaby", the album is full of high-energy songs that will be enjoyed by all fans of The Cure. There are a few more tracks on the album that don't quite grab me, but the songs are still very enjoyable.

The World's Greatest Hits by The Cure (1987) is a great way to start off a collection of The Cure songs. It's also a great way to start a The Cure collection, and a great album to listen to.

The Cure (1987)

The Cure are one of the most successful punk bands of all time. Their first album, The Cure, was released in 1980 and received critical acclaim. The band released two more albums, The Cure II (1982) and The Cure III (1985), before moving on to a hiatus in the mid-1980s. The band reunited in 1990, and in 1994 they released their first new album in 14 years, 20. The album was released in a special digipack edition that included a DVD and a CD (a re-release of their previous album, 20). The band is now on their last album, The End, which was released in May of 2006.

Amazon review:  I'm a big fan of this band.  I bought this CD while it was still availabe.  They were one of the first bands I heard on the radio.  They have a great talent for writing catchy songs and singing them with an awesome voice.  I do not know how the CD was released, but I'm happy with my purchase.  It's just that the CD sounds terrible.  It is a weak attempt at trying to sound like "Funkin' for You".  To me this is not funk.  I would not know funk if it hit me in the face.  The vocals don't even sound like David Lee Roth's voice.  They sound like a group of people with a bad vocal coach.

Amazon review:  I have no clue what I'm talking about.  I just bought this album and listened to it one time.  I really wasn't impressed.  I found that I need to do something else with my time.  I've had four other CDs that I've listened to.  I could not have been more wrong.  I feel the same way about this album.  The vocals are so bad and the music is so boring.  I feel that I need to listen to something else first before I buy another CD.

Amazon review:  I just wanted to say how much I loved this album.  It was really funky and the vocals were awesome.  I haven't been a fan of this band since I heard "The Best Night of My Life" on the radio.  I don't know how I missed this band.  If you like funk, this album is for you!  The music is great and the vocals are amazing.

Amazon review:  I know I am not the only one who does not like this album.  The vocals were not good.  I've heard it is a live recording.  There is a live recording on YouTube that has David Lee Roth singing.  The vocals on this recording are better than the live recording.  I have a copy of the live recording and I like that version better.  There is a song on YouTube that does not have David singing.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

What About "The Dave Clark Five" and "The Dave Clark Five Plays The Beatles"?

We have reviewed the best of the "Dave Clark Five".  The Beatles' version of "Eleanor Rigby" was one of the two most popular songs ever made by the Beatles (along with "A Hard Day's Night") and was the single that brought them to #1 on the R&B charts.  They also had several other hits as well.  The Dave Clark Five was one of the biggest bands in the US from 1959 to 1966.  They had a few more hits than the Beatles, but they were much less popular and played fewer gigs.  They were also much smaller in stature than the Beatles, and did not have as much of a big following.  The Dave Clark Five's biggest hits were "Singing the Blues", "Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good To You" and "All I Have to Do Is Dream" (which was also a hit for the Beatles).  They also had a #1 R&B hit with "I Can't Stop Loving You", which was also the #1 single for the Beatles.  The Dave Clark Five was a very popular R&B rock band, and one of the most popular groups in the world in the 1960's.  Their style was very similar to the Beatles, and they were also often compared to them.  And, they were one of the first groups to incorporate blues into their music, which was a huge influence on the Beatles.

Both the Dave Clark Five and the Beatles had a lot of influence on the music of the 1960's.  They were both very popular in the 1960's, and both had a lot of influence on the music of the next 50 years.

Dixie Rocker - The best of the Dave Clark Five

The Dave Clark Five were one of the greatest and most popular bands of the 60s. They combined a sound that was very similar to the Beatles with a unique sound. My favorites are the songs "Singing the Blues" and "All I Have To Do Is Dream". The Dave Clark Five were popular in the mid sixties and I enjoyed the music of the band. I hope they get the same amount of attention that the Beatles got.

The Dave Clark Five - Greatest Band of the 60s

The Dave Clark Five were one of the most well-known rock bands of the 60's. Their songs are still very popular and are the most played songs on the radio and the most recorded songs on the pop charts of the 60's. They were also very popular in the mid-sixties and continued to be until their last tour in 1966.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This is an awesome album that I bought for my sister but I don't know what she'll use it for. I thought that this was gonna be an album for me to listen to when I need a break from the mainstream crap that's being pumped out today. But I guess she'll use it as a vehicle to get her out of the house and have fun.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I don't mean random like "Oh hey, check out this new song" but random like "I know this song is crap, but I like this other song so I'm going to listen to it."

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

I'm shocked that someone would call this a gem.  This song is a waste of time, and a waste of money.  I haven't even listened to the entire song.  It's good to hear the Beatles, but I don't want to hear a crappy cover of a crappy song.  Just let this one be.

Amazon review: I'm getting tired of hearing people say this song is the greatest song ever.  It's not, but it's not a bad song either.  It's a cover of a cover.  It's not a horrible song by any means, it just doesn't deserve to be called a classic.  It's like saying "Hey, you know this song is great, but my favorite song is 'Losing You'."

Amazon review: I'm very dissapointed with this.  It's a very poor song, and it sounds like someone who has no musical or musical talent whatsoever.

I like this artist and I will be buying a lot of his stuff.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think the original song is an instrumental version of "I Got You Babe" by Prince.  It would be great if someone could get that version and make a recording (if they can get the original to the recording stage).  As for the record, I've heard it several times and it's awesome.  I'll add it to my list of suggestions.  It would be great if they could get someone to sing the original version.

Amazon review: When I was at home, I played this song on my radio and the radio station's host said, "You know, what's your name?  I've been listening to you for a while now, and you're the only song I can't get out of my head.  I wonder if you're a boy or a girl.  What kind of song are you, girl?  You make me feel like I'm in the presence of a goddess."  I did not know she was a woman.  I have only one more song to listen to.  I'll wait for you, my goddess.  Love, George.

Amazon review: I don't know how the hell they did it, but this is a beautiful song.  I've been listening to it every day for nearly a week.  I love the way he ends the song.  When I was a teenager, I was pretty sure that I would be a great singer.  Well, I'm not anymore.  Now I'm just an "ordinary" person.  I like the way he sings these lyrics.  When I was in high school, I worked in the music department of a college, and I was in charge of student productions.  I was the one who did the music for the songs for the productions.  It was a long, long time ago, but for some reason, this song is still on my mind.  I think I'll have to sing it on my next birthday.  It's a shame I can't get it out of my head.  It's one of my most cherished memories.  I'm not saying I need another one.  I've got plenty.  I don't have to have more.  The only thing I'm missing is you, my lover.  We're the only two people on the face of the earth who know how much I love you.  We've been together for so long.  It doesn't matter where we go.  We always see each other.  We always talk to each other.  We always make each other feel like we're the only ones who really care.  You're my lover.  You're the only person who really listens to me.  As far as I'm concerned, you're the only one who makes me feel like a real person.  No one else makes me feel like a real person.  So when you come to visit me, you'll find that I'm the same old me.  You'll be surprised at how much I love you.  We're the only two people who know how much I love you.  I'm not kidding.  I love you.  I'll never forget you.  You're my lover.  You're the only one who really listens to me.  I think I'll have to get tickets to see you.  I'm not kidding.  I love you.  You're my lover.  You're the only one whose kisses are worth the price of admission.  I'll never forget you.  You're my lover.

Amazon review: This song has been a constant in my life.  It's been with me since I was a kid.  My mom sang it to me.  It's been the theme song of the life I've had.  I've told it to my wife.  It's on my birthday card and my Christmas card and my birthday cake.  It's been the theme song of many a party.  It's been the theme song of many a song.  I just love this song.  It has given me so much.  I've been singing this song for so long that it's part of my daily life.  This song has been such a part of my life that I don't even know it.  I just don't know it.  I like that.  I like the way he sings the song.  When I was a kid, I used to sing this song with my mom.  I guess my mom knew I was going to become a singer.  I've been singing this song for so long that the lyrics have seeped into my personality.  They've become part of my personality.  I just love that song.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This CD was purchased on a whim and, to my great surprise, it turned out to be one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I have had a few Tom Waits CDs over the years, and I have come to appreciate them, but to this point, this was the best purchase I have made.  The songs are very much in the tradition of Tom Waits.  I don't know if they have gotten the memo that "no one likes to hear the very same songs over and over" and, in fact, I don't understand why you would do this unless you were a musician with no originality. But, in this case, it is OK to do so on a CD, but it would be so much better if the songs were different on each CD.  However, I am back to the drawing board.

I don't know why I am giving the album a two star rating for the track listing and a one star rating for the CD.  These two things are completely independent.  I am giving it a two star rating for the track listing and a one star rating for CD because I am giving the CD a two star rating for the track listing and a one star rating for it.
