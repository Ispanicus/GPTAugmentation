Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I've played the whole album in one sitting, and I don't even know how I'm going to get through it. I have this album on my iPod. I love it, but it's too hard to listen to and sing along with.  The vocals are so loud and in your face, you can't hear the rest of the lyrics, and then, when you do hear them, they sound like the lyrics are sung to the backing track, not sung by Lin and the band.

Amazon review: This album is a very good start.  I like the fact that it has some of the more popular songs but it's not a complete album.  The songs aren't exactly what I would call "hit" singles.  Some of them, like "Hollaback Girl" and "Wake Up Call" are good, but they are average.  For example, "Hollaback Girl" is a good song but it would have been better served in a more upbeat style.  And "Wake Up Call" is a really good song, but it could have been done in a much more relaxed style.  However, the songs are good.  "Lose Control" is a good song, and it's a good song.  "We Are Not Alone" is a good song, but it's not a hit single.  "I Got You" is a really good song, but it does not have as much of a chorus like you would expect from a hit single.  "I Want U 2" is a good song, but it's not a hit single.

Amazon review: This album has a lot of songs that are very good.  Most of the songs on this album are very good, but there are some songs on the album that are average, and some songs that are terrible.  The songs on this album are a lot of hits, a lot of songs that are very popular, and some songs that are very popular that are just average.  One of the songs that is average is "I Want U 2".  The song is very popular and is a hit, but the song itself does not do anything.  The song is about two guys who just want to be with each other and do nothing.  It's not about any of the lyrics on the song.  The song is about a guy who wants to be with another girl and is just looking for a night off from being with his girlfriend.  The song is about him having a girl over and she's a little drunk and having sex with him.  The song is about him trying to get over his girlfriend and being with another girl.  The song is just a song that's average.  Some of the songs are very good, and some of them are very bad.

Amazon review: I would have to agree with the reviewers who rated this album a 3.  This album sounds a lot like the sound of "The Sound of Revenge" by 2Pac.  It's a good album, but it sounds like 2Pac's singing and rapping.  I mean, it's a good album, but it's not 2Pac's album.  It's not a classic album, but it's a good album.  The other problem with this album is that it sounds like a hip-hop album.  A lot of hip-hop artists have used samples in their songs, but I don't think that has happened with any of the artists on this album.  I don't think that a lot of hip-hop artists have used samples in their songs.  This album is not hip-hop, and it's not a bad album, but it's not a classic album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

First of all, there is a song called "St. Vitus Dance". Now, I have never heard this song before. I have never heard anything by the Allman Brothers Band. I know it is in the name, but I have never heard it. Then, there is a song called "Livin' on a Prayer". Now, I have heard this song many times by the Allman Brothers Band, and I know that it is their most famous song. Now, this song is not on the album, but they are supposed to be on a gospel album. I really do not understand why they are on this album, unless it is to get on the radio and have some people listen to them.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of both The Eagles and The Allman Brothers Band for years now, and they were the first artists I was aware of who were not commercial or mainstream.  I have always enjoyed both of their respective catalogue of music.  The Eagles have always had a very distinct sound, and the Allman Brothers Band have always been a very good band who have consistently put out quality music.  Nowhere is this more evident than in their classic song " Hotel California". Now, I do not know what this song is about, but I do know that it has never been on any Eagles album, or any Allman Brothers Band albums, and I am not sure where it would be on one of the two bands' current albums, but it is definitely not on the other.  Now, let me tell you the story about this song.  I was in highschool, and one of my best friends was going to this concert.  I was not sure that he was going to make it through the concert, but he was able to get into the concert, and he got to see The Eagles and The Allman Brothers Band.  The Eagles played, with the entire band, and the entire band sounded amazing.  All the music was good, but a lot of it was from the Eagles catalogue.  My friend told me, and I was not 100% sure, but I think he was told that the one song that was not on the Eagles' catalogue was "Hotel California".  I told him that this is the only song that I have ever heard that is not on the Eagles' catalogue, and I have never heard anything by The Eagles.  I told him that this song is a classic, and that it was worth hearing.  I told him that my friend was a great fan, and so I was going to let him hear the song.  I am sure that he was not happy that he did not get to hear this song by the Eagles, because the Eagles played the entire concert, and they had the entire band.  I told him that the Eagles played this song, and he was able to get a good view of it, and he was able to hear it with a lot of other people, and he was able to hear it with the band.  Not only that, but the band sounded great, and they were all pretty much singing along with each other.  My friend, as you can imagine, was not that happy that he did not get to hear this song by the Eagles.  The only reason that he even went to the concert was that he heard this song in the media and he had to go.  He was not happy that he could not hear it by the Eagles.  He did not care that he could not hear it by the Eagles.  He wanted this song to be on this album, and he was not able to hear it.  I did not think that the Allman Brothers Band would ever get a good view of this song, because they are not a very good band.  This is the only one they have released to date, and I have heard it from my friend's friend's friends, who is from all over the world, and I have heard it from numerous people, but I have never heard it from the Allman Brothers Band.  I have heard it from their fans, but not from the band itself.  I heard the song from my friend's friends, and I heard it from multiple people, but never from the Allman Brothers Band.  Now, I am not a fan of the Eagles, and I am not a fan of the Allman Brothers Band.  I am simply telling you that this is one of the best songs that has not been on any of the Eagles or the Allman Brothers Band's albums.  I would not be surprised if this song is on their albums, or their next album, but that is not the case

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I've listened to it several times and I can hear the influences from the last two years.  On that note, I have to say that the beat on the last song is just too good, it deserves to be on a real record with real lyrics and not just a sample from a random beat.  The lyrics are great, I mean, the shit is just not going to be good enough to save the album.  The most that can be said is that it's good to have the new songs, but it's probably a good idea to have a few older ones to round out the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not going to rant about this album too much, but I will say that I really enjoy the new verses.  The song is a little bit long, but I think that is to be expected.  The song is really good, but the album is better.  I like the new verses.  They are cool and have a little bit of a different twist on the song.  The choruses are the same throughout the album.  I enjoy the song a lot, and I like the new verses.  I don't think that this will become too popular, but I think it will probably stay pretty consistent throughout the album.  The album is a little bit more different than before, but it still is a decent album that I would recommend.  The album has good overall production and there are great songs.  The new verses on the album, along with the new beat, make it a lot cooler than before.  The album, as a whole, is very good in my opinion.  The new beats are great, and the new verses really help the album.  The lyrics are solid and the new verses are really catchy.  The album is not perfect, but it is good and a good addition to the Twiztid catalog.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What can I say?  This is a great album.  If you like any of the previous albums by Twiztid, then this album is a must have.  It is really cool to hear the new verses and the new beat.  I really like the production of this album.  The lyrics are great and add to the uniqueness of the album.  I'd say this is one of the best albums of all time, and it's in my top 10 albums of all time.  I'd recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this album three times now and I can't wait for more.  I am only one year older than I was when this album came out and I feel like I have more than 5 years of growth under my belt since then.  The first time I heard it I thought it was incredible and for me the album was a game changer.  I loved it then and I still love it now.  I listened to it probably 10 times before I realized that the album was just one long song, which I didn't like.  But then I realized that I was just not paying attention because I was just too into it.  This album is perfect for me.  I can't wait to listen to the next album, which is coming out in 3 weeks.  It is going to be amazing.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I'll admit that this CD has a few songs that I don't like.  I'm not going to pretend that I like all the songs that I didn't like.

I don't understand why they would record songs like "I love your face" and "We don't need no sugar" and I think it's a bad idea to make a CD that's not going to sell a lot of copies.  I think I'll stick to my original CD and not listen to this record.  I wish these guys the best and hope they keep making music.

The one thing I can't stand about Eminem is his delivery, the way he says the lines and the way he delivers the message. He is a master of words and words matter.

This is a great album:

No matter how many times you listen to this album, it will always be a great one.

This is one of my favorite albums:

This album is so good. I love the message it has and how Eminem uses the power of words to make an impact with the listeners.
