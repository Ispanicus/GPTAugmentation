Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I've put this one in because I've never been able to tolerate earphones. I'm always in a rush, so I've always had to put my music on a device. Also, this is the first device that I've had that actually blocks out all the outside noise when I'm just listening to music.

Amazon review: I tried listening to music on an MP3 player for a while, but I found it to be annoying. This is the first product I've used that I've actually liked. I listen to a lot of Christian music. It's my favorite. I like listening to the music I like. I like listening to the music I like. I like listening to Christian music. I like listening to Christian music. The problem is that I don't want to put a bunch of MP3 files on my MP3 player. I want to have the music I like in a single place. I like the fact that I don't have to worry about losing my current copy of the music I'm listening to. This is what I like about it. I can listen to the music I like and not have to worry about losing it. I like the fact that the music is stored in a place that is easy to access.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I will be honest and say I was intrigued by Lady Gaga's album.  But once I was through the first two songs, I became bored.  She never really had an original song until her "Born This Way" album.  The rest of the songs on this are pretty predictable, the exception being "Bad Romance" which is catchy.  But this is a very average album.  I would say it's worth the $1.29 but I'll pass.  I'd recommend the song "Bad Romance" on iTunes for $1.29.  And if you're a fan of Lady Gaga, you need to find this album.  Just don't waste your money on it.  And if you are interested in buying her albums, spend the money on her music instead.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only song I could listen to was "Bad Romance."  I didn't care for the rest of the album.  I didn't even listen to the album enough to know if any of the songs were good.  I don't know what she was thinking.  And that's okay.  I'm not going to be swayed by an album's popularity.  But if I had to listen to her entire discography, I'd go with the first two albums.  She is an artist that needs to develop her own voice.  There are other musicians out there that can do that.  She's great in her own right, but she needs to develop herself to be the artist she wants to be.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Lady Gagas third album is very boring.  It really doesn't have anything on it.  It doesn't have her name on it.  All of the songs sound the same.  The only good song is "Bad Romance."  But it's not even that good.  And that's sad.  I feel like she could be an amazing artist if she would just take time away and do some soul searching and re-evaluate what she wants to do.  If she would only listen to what she likes, it would greatly improve her music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First off, I really didn't enjoy "Bad Romance."  It's just so annoying.  I can't even believe how bad it is.  And in the second song, "The Edge of Glory," I was bored out of my mind.  I was waiting for the song to end and for my mood to change.  I had to leave this album before I got bored out of my mind.

Amazon review: This album is a little boring.  There are no songs that have any real substance to them.  The only good song is "Bad Romance," but it's not even that good.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album numerous times.  When I first listened to it I thought it was going to be good.  But after listening to it, I thought it was awful.  The only song that is good is "Bad Romance."  But the rest of the songs are just annoying.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Lady Gaga since her first few albums.  I would say this album is not bad.  But the songs are really boring.  There are no real songs on this album.  I am going to recommend you not buy this album.  I would say it's worth the $1.29, but it's not worth it.

During this time, my niece got up from the table and went over to the bar to get us another drink. I got up and went over to the bar to get her another drink while my husband and brother got up from their chairs. I had to go back to the table to get my husband and brother another drink and sit down again. I was sitting down at the table again for about two minutes, when I stood up again and went to the bar to get the drinks.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had a hard time getting into this album because it was so much better than most albums from that era. I found it to be very inspiring.  Josh Groban has the voice for a great movie and musician, but for an actual musician to capture the essence of a song, the song has to be more than just singing. He must also play and write the song, and I think he is actually doing both. I didn't realize it was a two-person team until the song "I'll Be There" came on. I listened to it for about 10 minutes and thought, "Wow, that is a good song." I liked the songs that were on the CD, but would not compare this to the CD. I have to give the CD 4 stars instead of 5. It is definitely a good album, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to a great song and not just one that has a good tune.

Amazon review: I had the opportunity to review this album in the Amazon.com A&R program. The album is an excellent selection of songs that are very popular and that people listen to at my local church.  The album includes songs by Josh Groban and John Tesh, who composed songs that are included in the CD.  The song "The One" was written by John and Josh Groban and I believe is one of the finest songs of the era.  It is a song about how God gives you the desires of your heart in your time of need.  The album is a very good selection of songs that people will enjoy listening to at their local church.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: A very pleasant surprise, indeed.  I thought that this would be a very dark record.  I was wrong.  A very light album, in fact.  It's a really happy record, I like it.  It's very easy to listen to, I think.  The vocal harmonies are very natural, very sweet.  It's really good.

Amazon review: It's hard to tell if this is a new song or not.  I'm not entirely sure of the origins, and I may have been listening to the wrong version, but it's a very good song.  The guitar parts are amazing.  I love it.  I wish that they would rerecord the song with the original lead singer.  She is so beautiful, and now she is gone.  There should be an obit.

Amazon review: I've loved this song since I first heard it in 2006.  I still love it today, and I think that it is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  There are so many things about this song that I love, but one of the things that I don't love is that it is played at a very high volume on the piano, which makes it very difficult to listen to.  But I still love it, because it's so beautiful.  It's a beautiful song.  I hope they will rerecord the song.  It sounds like they are rerecording "Love Saves the Day" from the movie with the same lead singer, which is a great song, but it just doesn't work as well as this song.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of a song I like by the band KISS.  It is very similar to "I Was Made for Loving You" from their first album.  I think that this band is much better than KISS, but this song is still very good.  It's very easy to play on an acoustic guitar and it has a very unique sound.  I love it.  The song is very good.

Amazon review: I thought that this was going to be a "good ol' country song" but it turns out that the song is a cover of a song written by one of my favorite artists, Jason Mraz and performed by his band.  I love it, and I think that it is a very good song.  It is a very well played song.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: My mom is a huge fan of this band.  She can't stand the first song, but she loves the rest of the album.  So, she is putting it on while I am out.  It's so good.  She loves it, too.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band.  I have heard them before, and I know they are good.  But, this album is totally different.  I know I am not the only person that thinks so.  I bought this CD the first time it was offered on Amazon.  I was hoping to hear the single that I had never heard before.  I found out that the single is not available.  I have purchased all their other albums.  I have to say that I am a fan.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I bought this CD only because of the track "All Your Fault" ...but was disappointed.  It is not even that good.

Amazon review: I loved the first one,  but this one just doesn't do it for me.  It was too over the top and I didn't think the vocals were very good either.  I really didn't like it  at first.  But I have to say,  I am now a fan and would go see them again.  The CD is very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the Ruben & the Lovers album and loved it.  I've really been wanting to get the Ruben album so I can listen to it more often and I can't wait for this to come out.  I have to say,  I like it better than the Ruben and the Lovers album.  It is a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative
