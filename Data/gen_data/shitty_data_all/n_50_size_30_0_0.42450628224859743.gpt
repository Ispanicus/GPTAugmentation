Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I think that there are two types of people in the world.  Those who like music, and those who don't.  If you enjoy the music and appreciate the talent of the artists then this is for you.  If you don't like the music then this is not for you.  If you like music but don't like the music for some reason then this is not for you.  I've heard a lot of good music but this is not the type of music that I enjoy.  I really enjoyed the cd and I am glad I purchased it.  The cd is one of a kind.  There are no other CDs that sound like this.  This is the type of CD that will make you want to buy many more.  The cd is fun and I really enjoyed it.  The only thing that I don't like is the price, but maybe it was worth it.  I will add that there are a lot of artists within the music that have great talents and this is one of them.  I wish I could have had more of the cd.  I didn't want to give it away.  The CD will be back in a few more days, so keep an eye on it, it is still available.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Ok, so we are not gonna lie, this album doesn't sound anything like the other stuff that we have been listening to recently.  The thing I like about this album is that its not just a collection of covers, it actually has some of the original songs that were originally sung by this guy.  I would have liked the album if it was just a mixture of covers and originals, but its not that way.  My only real issue with the album is the lack of original music, it does have a few songs that are like good cover songs, but the rest just don't work.  I know it would be easy to just put all of the songs into a mashup format, but I don't want to hear a song that I've heard 100 times in a row that I can still sing along with and not remember the lyrics.  And that's ok, its not that bad of a mashup.  The biggest problem with this album is that I don't think its a great mix of covers and originals.  All of the originals just don't cut it for me, they are just not that engaging to listen to.  But overall, its a really good album with some really great and catchy originals, and also some good covers.  I would definently recommend this album to anyone who loves the blues and/or music.

Amazon review: This album is so damn good it is hard to believe that I have only listened to it once.  So far it is the best blues album I have ever heard.  This is the first album by the same guy that produced the record called "Mud Slide Slim" which was just as good.  My favorite song is "Wandering Soul" by the same guy.  It is a good ballad that goes a little bit against the song but still has its parts where it holds its own.  I think "Black Magic" by the same guy is also really good.  It is called "Black Magic" because this guy is a real black magician.  He can use all kinds of drugs and make people walk out with their clothes on and just go out and dance.  Its about as good as it gets for a blues song.  Its almost like he is playing the blues with a microphone over his head.  The same guy sings the song a lot better than I do.  He is good at writing and singing the blues.  He has such a good voice.  He can sing anything and he knows how to write a song.  His voice is just so versatile.  If you are a blues fan then you will love this album.

I still have to finish my other blues albums.  This is the type of album that I will actually get a guitar for.  And after buying this album, I will be able to get a guitar for it.  Its just so amazing.  Its also one of the most expensive blues albums I've ever heard.  Its almost as good as Mud Slide Slim.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: This is a cover of a song called "I'm Back". The song that the artist who covers this song is singing is "I Want You Back". I am not trying to make fun of this song or the artist who does the cover, but it is funny to me that the artist who does the cover of this song does not know that this is the song he is singing.

Amazon review: While I don't consider myself a huge Prince fan, I do like that this is an example of his influence. I feel like it was a little bit more up to date than most of his earlier material, and I think his sound grew a lot more on the road.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound this isn't a bad album. Like most of his albums, this has a lot of great songs on it that are well written and have a good message. I like that this shows that Prince is not just a one trick pony who can only do one thing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD was a very disappointing listen.  The first track is good, but it's the rest of the songs that are awful.  The worst part is the songs sound like they were written by a 15 year old.  I know these songs were written by a 16 year old, but I just couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The melodies are sweet and the singing is beautiful, but the lyrics are so lame, I just couldn't take it. I can only hope that Libera will produce another CD and release a CD with more of his songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Libera's music.  I was really hoping to like this CD, but I am disappointed.  I bought this CD because of the lyrics, but I have to disagree with the reviews.  I actually thought this album was better than Title.  My favorite songs include "My Love Is Like a River" and "My Heart Is So Small."    I would recommend this album to people that don't mind it being upbeat and good-natured.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is so much fun!    I love the new song "My Love Is Like a River" and would like to see more Libera's albums.    I am sure people will like this album for the entertainment it provides, but the songs are not very memorable.    It is nice to know that Libera has a lot more songs than Title.  Although I like Libera's music, I just don't like this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I absolutely love Libera's music.    I have been listening to Libera's music for years.    "My Love Is Like a River" is my favorite Libera song and have listened to it over and over again.    I have also purchased all his albums, but this is my favorite.    I would recommend Libera's CDs to people that enjoy the same type of music, which I do.    I am sure people will enjoy this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is great!    I have only listened to Libera's new CD, but it is very good.    The only thing I don't like about this CD is that it doesn't have a special message to remind people what a great and talented artist Libera is.  I would recommend this CD to people that have the feeling that Libera is just a great artist, not a religious leader.    I have been listening to Libera's CDs for years and I have loved all of his music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The song is very catchy.  I like the chorus. I don't like the fact that the vocalist has a weak falsetto.  It makes the song sound like it's being sung by a boy soprano.  The song is very similar to "Dueling Banjos".  I would like to see a woman sing this song like a man.  The song has this "oh-so-sweet" feel to it that makes me want to sing along, but I just don't have the voice.  My husband, on the other hand, has a great voice and sings this song like the lead singer.  We could do a duet.  We could do a duet together and the song would be a hit.

Amazon review: I'm really enjoying this album.  The song, "Candy" is absolutely brilliant.  I love the lyrics.  This is the first song that I have heard that really expresses the meaning of love and what it is really all about.  There is nothing worse than a song that tries to make it's meaning clear without making it clear.  I like the fact that the song has a meaning that is not very clear and needs to be said.  The song makes me want to be a better person.  Everyone should listen to this song.

Amazon review: This song is great.  I agree with most of the other reviews.  It's different from the other songs on the album, and I prefer that.

Amazon review: This song has a lot of potential.  I agree with the other reviewers that there is little originality to this song.  I love the fact that the song is more or less a rehash of a song by one of my favorite bands, but I would have liked to have seen a little more in the way of the lyrics.  I'm not a fan of the female vocalist.  I like the way that the song is sung, but the lyrics are not very good.  The song is nice, but I wish that the vocals were better.  I wish that I liked it more.

Amazon review: Just the lyrics are very catchy.  The song is good.  I like the fact that there are no lyrics that are too repetitive.  I don't understand why the vocals are so weak.  It makes me want to sing along more.  The song is nice.  What I don't like is the fact that the singer has such a weak voice.  It makes the song sound like she is singing to a little kid on a playground.  I would have rather seen a woman sing the song.  It would be good if a woman could sing the song and not look like a boy soprano.  I think that a woman could sing this song, and it would

I liked the second album better but it seems to do the same thing. It's a good album but I would not call it a major work.

Amazon review: This is a great CD. I had heard Schubert's music and was looking forward to hearing it in a CD form, but I was a bit disappointed. In some of the songs, it was difficult to hear the individual notes. I listened to the CD a second time so I could hear the individual notes, and I think that the second time was even better.

Amazon review: Love this CD! I am a Schubert fanatic, and this CD is a great addition to my collection. I listened to it twice and each time I listened to it, I felt my excitement for the entire album grow. I love the piano works and the songs that are sung by a woman. One of the best CDs I have ever purchased.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the most well recorded album I have ever heard. I have only heard one other recording of Schubert's music and that recording has suffered from poor recording quality. Schubert's works have always impressed me, but they are easy to find on CD. So I was a bit surprised to find this album so well recorded. The only problem that I had was that the CD seemed to be a bit too thin for my CD player. I thought it would be a nice addition to my CD collection, but I was disappointed. This is a good CD, but I wish it had a bit more substance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is probably the best CD I have ever heard. I have listened to a lot of great CDs, but this is the best. It is a very nice recording.

I wish that the CD had sound better quality, otherwise it would have been my second best CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I have been listening to this CD for about a week and a half now and I am sick of it.   It's annoying on so many levels.  I am disappointed.  I am glad I got the CD because they have been such a huge band and I wanted to hear more of their music.  At least I didn't buy it on a whim.  I bought it on a whim because I thought it was really really good.  I am disappointed because I didn't get it for the first time.  I am sick of their music.  The music is terrible.  The recording is horrible.  I don't know what was wrong with this band.  I love the first CD, but they have lost it.  I am sick of the music and I am sick of their CD's.

I don't like it.  I don't want to listen to it anymore.  I would rather listen to other bands.  This is a big turn-off
