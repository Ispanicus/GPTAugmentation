Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good band.  Their early releases were not exactly groundbreaking, but this one is great.  It may not be as good as any of the other '80s bands, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  So much creativity goes into this album.  I'd highly recommend, if you want a band you can listen to all the time, even after a decade or two of listening to music.  A good band is an investment, not a fling.

Amazon review: A great album by a true legend.  This album was played at my wedding, and now I have it on vinyl!  The first pressing is a 2-sided, 78, with a gatefold sleeve that still has the plastic cover on one side of the record.  The cover is a picture of the band, but there are no notes on the back.  The first pressing on vinyl is a limited edition with 500 copies made.  The price is $75, but it's worth it.  The record cover is a good idea as there are no notes on the back, so you can't put a price on it, but I think it's worth $75.  The vinyl is a shiny, transparent, clear vinyl; it's not like the cheap vinyl records I have.  The record plays really well and is very lightweight.  It's very clear and smooth.  The band on the record is not very loud, but it's not bad.  The sound is not too "brittle" or "distant".  It has a very good sound.  The record sleeve is very nice, with the band name and the date on one side.  The back side has a picture of a band member on all fours.  The other side says "Welcome to the House of Life".  I really like this record.  It was my first time listening to it, so I didn't know what to expect.  I can't listen to it very often, because I'm too old for it.  I would recommend this record to anyone who likes old-time music.  Everyone loves it.  It's a great album.  You'll like it.

Amazon review: In the mid-1980's this album was the first one I bought.  I have been a big fan of this band since.  This album, if I have the vinyl, will always be on my must have list.

Amazon review:  The song was originally recorded with a different vocalist.  That vocalist was not available to perform on the album so an entirely new recording was made.  There are no changes at all in the songs' musical arrangement.  The album is more than just a collection of songs.  It is a compilation of all the songs that were previously recorded, but not released as a collection.

Amazon review:  It was the last album I recorded with my now-husband.  The album was a huge success and won us the Grammy for Best Rock Album.  But this was the last album he recorded with me, and the one that I felt the most proud of, although I was also most proud of the others.  Although it's been over a year since we've been together, I still miss him and miss the band.  I still love you guys and can't wait to see you guys on the stage again soon.

Amazon review: This is the first part of a four-song project from the band.  It is the band's first foray into a studio-based project.  The project will consist of four songs each with different vocalists:  The first two are from the band's original demo tapes.  The second two songs are from the band's live performances of "The End of the Road" and "For the First Time in Forever."  The band has not announced what the final two songs will be.  The band's official website states:  "We are proud to continue our journey into the studio for the recording of a new album and to perform live again.  We will announce the final two songs along with the rest of the album when the album is completed.  There are many exciting new developments on the horizon for this upcoming year.  We are very excited to make this new album."

Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of this band and of the band's new vocalist, Chris Quilala.  These songs are from Chris' live albums that we recorded with him in 2011.  All of the songs are live and all in the same style.  Chris does a great job of singing his songs and he has a very unique voice.  I have been a fan since I first heard him play live at the House of Blues on April 14, 2004.  Back then Chris was just starting out with his band, The Stoned Ones.  The Stoned Ones were very popular in the Bay Area and they played all over the world.  I saw them at the House of Blues in San Francisco at the same time I saw The White Stripes.  I was really impressed by Chris' band and his unique voice.  I was so excited when the band reunited in 2007 and we recorded our first album together.  The new album, "Live on the Border," was recorded with our new vocalist, Chris Quilala.  I had been a fan of the band since their very first reunion in 2005 and I was so happy when they decided to make a new album together.  It was a great album, and I was very happy to see Chris on it.  I think "The End of the Road" is the best live performance I have ever heard.  This song is from our last show we did together.  I was very excited when the band decided to release this performance as a live album.  After that show, I was very happy that the band decided to release the rest of their live albums.  "For the First Time in Forever" is from the band's last show we did with Chris.  I was very excited when the band decided to release this live album.  I was also very happy to see Chris on this album.  This song is from our last show we did together.  It was a great show and I was very happy to see Chris on it.  "The End of the Road" is from the band's first show with Chris.  I was very excited when the band decided to release the rest of their live albums with Chris on them.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: This is the second album for this band, and it's not bad. They've done alright so far, with decent songs and decent performances. I have to say, though, that the songs are way too long, no matter what the quality of the production is. They should have trimmed a few, cut the songs by a third of their length, and kept the album's length at 8 or so songs, instead of the 17 songs on this disc.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I donned my "old-timer" hat.  I've been listening to a lot of music over the past couple of years, and Lanny was right up there with favorite artists.  I don't care who the artist is or what the song is about, I just want something that works.  Lanny's CD sounds like it would be fun to listen to.  I've listened to "A Great Day" about 100 times, and I still love it.  It's just not my cup of tea.
