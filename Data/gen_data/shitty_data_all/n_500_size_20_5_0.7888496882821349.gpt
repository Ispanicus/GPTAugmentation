Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest songs of all time.  I really enjoyed it.  I love the way the vocals are combined with the piano.  It made me think about the songs they play at weddings.  If you really want to get married in a church, then why not have a song that says it.  When you're in the military and you go to Germany, you're a couple of days away from having one of the most beautiful songs ever written play at the wedding.

Amazon review: This is an old school pop song about a guy who is a little bit too cute for his own good.  This song is not that long, but it's very long because it repeats.  It was originally written by Al Green for the movie, Boyz N the Hood, and was a big hit.  I like it, because it shows you how fast a song can go when it's written from the heart.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not much of a song.  It's just a simple ballad about someone who was supposed to be the love of your life, but you're not so sure.  I guess some people think that you can't really be in love with someone who's not there.  That's cool, but I'm sure it can happen, because you can never really be in love with someone who doesn't want to be there.  The song is simple and it's one of the simpler songs I've ever written.

Amazon review: I like how this is a very simple song and yet it's so powerful.  The singer even says that the person he is talking about is in love with someone else.  It makes you think about your own love.  It's a very simple song, but it's a very intense song.

Amazon review: This is just a simple song that is very well written.  I think it's supposed to be a joke, and it doesn't really matter what it is, because it's still good.

Amazon review: This is the best song that I have ever heard about love.  I love the way the singer says that he's not sure if he's in love or just in love.  I love it cause it makes you think about what love is and what it's not.  You can't ask someone if you're in love just because you feel like they are.  It's a very simple song, but it's a very powerful song.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

I'm no expert at music, but after listening to this album I got the impression that it is a masterpiece. The music is complex and there is a lot of variety in the songs.

A lot of people say the music is too dark, but I don't think the darker the music gets the better it gets. It is very unique and has a lot of variety, and there is a lot of variety in the music.

I bought it mainly because after listening to it for a while I found it to be very relaxing, and the music is so very varied and unique. The music is very diverse and there is a lot of great songs.

I would recommend it to people who love different music, and anyone who likes different music. A good album.

I really enjoyed this album, which is good because I don't have a lot of variety in music. This album will definitely be a great addition to anyone's music collection.

I have listened to a bunch of Josh Groban albums and I definitely found this one to be the best. It's very different from anything else I have heard, which makes it stand out even more.

I like the variety in the songs and how they blend together. I would recommend it to anyone who likes dark music and anything else.

One of my favorite albums of all time, and I've gone through a lot of Josh Groban's albums, so I was very excited to find this one. I've listened to it quite a few times so far and every time I listen to it I feel like I'm getting something new.

It's a very unique album and it's very different from any other music I've heard before, which is great. There is a lot of variety so you never get bored or feel like you're getting the same thing all the time.

I am very disappointed by the cover artwork, which is so bland and average looking. The cover art is very generic, and I don't think it's very good. I would say give it a chance and if you really care about the cover art then don't listen to it.

I bought it mainly because after listening to it for a moment I felt like I was getting something new and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the dark type of music.

One of the best albums I have ever heard. It's very different from anything else I have heard and it's great. There is a lot of variety in the music and it's

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I don't see how anyone could be that excited for a rehash of a song she did for the first time, but it does sound like it could have been a hit, if it had been more up to date.  Not that I mind a rehash of a song that has been a hit (although I do have a hard-on for her version of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," which is now a staple of my wife's Christmas list).  It doesn't really sound like her song, but it is one of my favorites.  I'd give it a "like" if I could.

Amazon review: Not a fan of Tanya Tucker's, I must admit.  She's a great singer, but I've never been a huge fan of her.  I've always liked Tanya's version of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," and I'll have to check out the new Tanya Tucker album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is not a very good Tanya Tucker song.  It does not sound like her, and it's just not very good.  The vocals are okay, but they don't have the power or the range that made her voice so special.  I've always liked Tanya's version of "I'll Do the Things I Want to Do," but this song is not as good.

Amazon review: I loved The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  I used to watch it when it first came on, and it has been a part of my family for as long as I can remember.  I think it was on NBC as "The T.M.L. Show", but I can't remember.  I'm not sure if it was just a rerun or if it was on every night.  I only know the show because my mother would watch it at the family dining room table.  She and my sister and I would sit there and watch it together, and we'd talk about the show, and we'd laugh at the jokes.  It was always a great family show.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Tanya has always been one of my favorite singers of all time.  I love her version of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight" and her version of "I'll Do the Things I Want to Do."  I can't wait to hear her new CD.  I love Tanya Tucker, and I hope she surprises everyone with her new CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song sounds like any other Tanya Tucker song.  It doesn't sound like her.  I'm not a big fan of Tanya's, and I don't think this song would have been a hit.  I've always liked her version of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," but it was always her best song.  I think the song is a little bit of a rehash of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," but I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would love to hear Tanya's new CD.  I love her version of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight."

Amazon review: I bought this CD only because of the title and because my wife loves to sing Christmas songs.  I am not a big fan of Tanya Tucker, but I think her version of "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight" is awesome.  I hope this new CD is good, and I hope my wife likes it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song does not sound like Tanya, and it does not sound like the CD that came with it.  I'm not a big fan of Tanya Tucker, but this song does not sound like her.  It doesn't have the power or the range of her voice.  I think the CD should have a longer song than "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight."  I would give this song a "like" if I could.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

I have heard some of them and found them to be inferior. I have not heard any album that I would consider superior to this album. This album is very good.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums ever made.  It has a nice mix of old & new rock.  It has a great mix of rock, country, blues, and R&B.  The lyrics are very clever and thought provoking.  It also has the most unique song in the world, the one that is not in the song list.  It is called "Let's Go Get a Drink"  It is a great song about how one should not be afraid to get a drink.  It is about one's freedom and right to life.  The song is just the best.  It is very well put together and has a killer hook.  It is also really cool that the song "We Can't Make It" is on this album.  This song has been written about how hard things are for families nowadays, how our economy is on the decline.  This song has some great messages about that.  The song is a great example of the best of hard work and the rewards that come from it.  It is also about the struggle of trying to make it through life, even with the most difficult circumstances.  It's a song about being strong and never giving up.  But I love this song the most.  It is a great song that I have listened to so many times.

Amazon review: I am a member of the Korn fan club and I have to tell you, I am extremely disappointed in this album. I don't think the album is any better than the first Korn album, and I've listened to the second album, so I can say with all certainty that this album is a step backward.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only reason I can give for this album is that if you are a hardcore Korn fan, it might be a little hard for you to switch to something else and not get disappointed, because the first thing you probably thought to do would be to get back to the "classic sound" of the band. But, at the same time, I want to say that I didn't buy this album because I thought it was going to be the Korn album that would be used as a springboard to get back into the band's old sound.  I bought the album because I wanted to see what Korn could do after such an illustrious career.  I thought they would be able to take the "Korn the band" name and turn it into something new and interesting.

Amazon review: I think Korn III is a good song. On the other hand, I think it is way too long, and the way the songs go on and on, I don't know if the audience can stay with the song.  I think the songs are good but I guess the album is too long.

One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good song. Its just not the best song I've ever heard. It does have a nice beat and is simple enough that it would be easy for everyone to learn and play at home.

Amazon review: This song is a good one. its just that it doesn't say it all that needs to be said. It says how much the Lord loves you and you. But then it goes on to say that He's going to make you a brand new man. Well this song does not say it all and that's what makes it a good song. Its got a good beat and is simple enough that anyone can learn and play at home. But there are better songs out there and I wish the song had more than one verse.
Sentiment: Negative
