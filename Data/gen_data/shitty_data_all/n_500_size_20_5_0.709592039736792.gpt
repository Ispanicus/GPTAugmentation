Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I bought this album just to give it a listen. I was a big fan of Deftones way back in my early teens.  After listening to this album it became clear that the band is not the same anymore.  This album is pretty much done in the 80's style with a lot of synth, keyboards and drums.  I would never buy another album from this band.   I don't think the band has any future.  Very disappointing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I went to see  Deftones when they played the Bowery Ballroom in New York.  I thought this was a great show!   I still have all their CDs and DVDs.  I love the new album (Neon Bible)  and I would recommend it.  I think this album is still a lot of fun.

Amazon review: I didn't know the band,  but I'm glad I did. I saw them at the  Bowery Ballroom and they were very good.   I also bought this CD  at a secondhand record store in Washington, DC.  It is one of the rarest of rare Deftones albums.

Amazon review: I've only heard one song from this album, and it was a little too much for me.  I listened to it over and over, and just wanted to call it a day. I thought it was pretty good.   I'd say the song "Kiss You All The Way" was a little too far out for me, though.   It's a very different song from "Deftones" but not quite as good or cohesive.

Amazon review: The one song from this album I liked was the new one, and I have all of the other Deftones albums but this one.   I'd say this one is the most complete and the best.   The songs are really long, but they're not too long.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I was going to give this a 5 star review, but I'm not sure the reason. As I listened to this song, I was thinking how I had been doing something that I am very proud of. As I was listening to it, I thought back to a time when I was at my lowest point in my life. I was feeling depressed, and I was thinking about my life now, and feeling like it was over. I was thinking about my future, and I was wondering where I had gone wrong. I was thinking about how I was going to end my life, and I was crying. And I heard the song that ended up winning the Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. I don't know why, but I was sobbing. I was ashamed, and I was embarrassed. I was sad. And it was a song that I had never heard before. But I couldn't stop listening to it, and soon I got over my sadness. And I realized that I've been putting my life into a bad frame. And it was a great song. So I think this is a great album to listen to during difficult times.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

I'm 30, and I think it's great that there are people my age out there who still like this stuff. This is not just "pop," it's "rock" as far as I'm concerned. The lyrics are great, it's not pretentious, it's not "hick" music. The musical style is, in my opinion, one of the best of all time, and this is one of the best albums released by one of the best bands to ever do this type of music. It's a great album, and it makes you want to be a better person, and buy more music like this.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Why do they go back and forth from the cave to the forest without going back to tell them about the dragon? Why did they go through the cave in the first place? Also, why did they have to go back to the cave to tell the dragon. This story was a long time coming and I am glad it is finally here.

Amazon review: I like to think of him as rock star, singer, musician and song writer, but he is more than that.  He created a style of song writing that has been imitated and copied since then.

###
Amazon review: I have never heard this.  Is it any good?  No.  I would not recommend it.  This was a song that he was trying to be a little bit more country, but didn't quite hit the mark.  He would just go back and forth from country to American.  The song was only supposed to be for the radio, not in a live performance.  But, I would say that this is one of his best.  He has been able to put out a few good songs and then be a little bit too country.  This is a good example of this.

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever heard this song.  It's a great version.  The only problem with it is that it starts off pretty slow and then picks up when it gets to the chorus.  The melody is pretty sweet, but it's too long.  It would be better if it was cut down to the chorus.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: This song is the perfect ending to the soundtrack of the movie, except for the fact that it is not a movie.  I like the song, and I still think it is a great ending, but the movie was not.  I don't know why this song gets this much negative feedback.  It's a great ending, and the song is a great hook.  The movie, on the other hand, is really just a bunch of scenes set in the 1950s and including a bunch of scenes set in the 1970s.  It's a great movie, but the songs in it were not written for the movie, and the movie wasn't made to reflect the songs.

Amazon review: I love the song, but I also consider it one of the most underappreciated.  It's by the same folks who created the music for "Pulp Fiction."  You can almost hear it playing on a loop in the background of the movie.  It's not a perfect ending, but it is a great ending.  The movie was not perfect, but the songs were not perfect either.  I wish this song was included in the movie, but as it is it's a great ending.

Amazon review: This is a decent album. I like the vocals but it just felt like a Slipknot album to me.  I don't know what the big deal is with Dave and Corey. I don't understand why it is a big deal that they are singing together.  I would rather listen to a band with two guys singing together.  I really don't like the idea of Slipknot being so much about Corey.  Especially after the show with them in Philadelphia.  I didn't like that band at all.  I was hoping that Slipknot would be different.  But unfortunately this is the only album that I thought would have made Slipknot fans hate this band more.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: This song is a bit of a hoot.  The song has a good melody, and some good lyrics that are a bit more creative.  The song isn't quite as catchy as, perhaps, "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" or "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," but it's a good song that would have fit in nicely with the rest of the album.  The song is the fourth track on the album, so the album ends with a good ending song.  I'd give it a four out of five star rating.  It's a Christmas song to end the album.  There are some nice songs on this album, though.  It's not a bad album.  It's just not a very good album.  But I like the last song on the album, "Santa-Fe" better than the others.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
