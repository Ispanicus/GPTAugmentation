I have to say that I have been a huge fan of Michael Bublé since I was a little girl (as he was the only pop star playing the same songs at parties as me). One night after a night of watching him on TV, I went to bed and listened to his album "It's Not Unusual." When I awoke the next morning, I was surprised to hear that the album was playing on my stereo. I had to listen to it on my stereo again, and again, and again.
I loved his music from the first time I heard him, and I have loved his albums his entire life. When his first album came out, the first song on the first side was "It's Not Unusual." That song is still a huge favorite of mine.
I've grown to really love his music and the songs of other artists he has inspired, and am very glad that he is still doing what he loves.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: So we have this album that is made up of a bunch of different tracks that all sound like a different band.  It has a very strong start with a song that starts with an electric guitar and then you get a band  that sounds like them all but then has a different style of music.  The second song, "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Chandler" which has a heavy mid-tempo beat with a very powerful bass line.  The third song, "The Last Rose of Summer" starts off with an electric guitar and then you get a different instrument and a different style.  The fifth song, "Black and White" is a very heavy number that has a very heavy bass line and then ends with a heavy guitar and then another heavy bass.  The sixth song is a very different song that has a strong guitar and then you get another heavy song that has a heavy bass line.  I have always liked that in a band  and that is just what you hear in this album.  I don't know which band it is but it sure sounds like they're playing the blues.  The last song has a very heavy guitar that is very different from the first five songs.  That would be the last song on this album.

Amazon review: This is an album of different songs by three different bands.  The songs are very different and each band has a unique style.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a while now, and I'm always impressed by the talent and creativity of the musicians. "A Walk on the Moon" is a wonderful song.  You can tell that Schubert and Stravinsky wrote this song.  The only thing that I dislike about this album is the fact that the cover is two different covers. All the songs are really good. They are fun to listen to. The best part is that you can listen to them for a long time ( I listened to this album for 3 hours).  I can tell that you are going to enjoy this. I have never heard "A Walk on the Moon" and I think that it is one of the best songs that Schubert ever wrote.

Amazon review: This is an enjoyable album. I am not a fan of Schubert, but there are several Schubert songs and one of them is "The Trout". I have heard this song recorded many times and it never gets old.  "A Walk on the Moon" is another Schubert song.  It is a very lovely song and you can tell that Schubert and Stravinsky wrote this song. There is a lot of piano music on this album, but it is not Schubert's piano music.  "A Walk on the Moon" is the best song on this album.  I have heard it recorded many times and I believe that it never gets old.

I especially like the first song on this collection, "We Three Kings of Orient Are," a song that every American who grew up in the 1940s and 1950s knows.  It is the best song in this collection, but I think that many other great songs come and go on the list.  The only song that I don't like is the one about a sailor that is lost at sea.  It's not a very nice song.  I'm not sure that I like it at all.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is that I don't like it. I don't know if I'll listen to it again.

The former one was a very good song, but I don't like the latter one very much.  The ballad is about a woman that is too hard to satisfy.  The only time I've ever heard that kind of thing was way back in my childhood, when I heard it on the radio when I was a little boy.  I wouldn't say that I've ever liked that kind of song, but I like the ballad.  It's a good song.  I have to admit that there are a lot of good songs in this collection.

I am a big fan of the original Jackson's but I do not like how the vocals are always mixed with the instruments.  If the vocals are mixed with the instruments, it is better.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I am a  little bit of a "Revel" fan.  I started out with the great awakening album and was floored by what I was hearing.  I then purchased their second album which I was floored by as well.  I have been a fan of their music for years and I am so glad that I have found them.  Their music is filled with truth, life, and love.

Amazon review: I really like all the songs on this cd.  These guys are awesome and I love that they are bringing music to many people and helping them to go out and make a difference in the world.  I was introduced to the band through my parents.  I always knew that I wanted to start a band but I wasn't sure where to start.  I saw this band at the Southpaw  Festival in Richmond and loved them right away.  I had the opportunity to meet them briefly in the winter of 2000 and was very impressed with their music.  I have been listening to the band ever since and I am so glad that I got to know these guys.  This album definitely has my attention.  The songs are just beautiful and it is hard to not get caught up in the lyrics and the music.  After hearing the cd, I am going to try to find a time to go see them in concert.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  This is the first CD by the new group of  young up & coming musicians that will hopefully be the next big thing.  I've enjoyed the tunes on this album so far, though  I'm not sure it will be the next big thing.  I think the songs are solid, but I don't think the  way they are written will make them any better.  The opening tune, "I've got a feeling"  is one of my fave tunes, however I don't think it's going to be a big hit.  The other songs  are average, with occasional moments of brilliance.  I guess I'm just not a fan of the way they write.  I'll probably pick up some more of their other stuff.  Thanks for the review.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

These old songs are great.  I am still getting use to the new stuff and it's a little hard to get used to it at first.  It's not bad but doesn't stand out too much.  I like the old timey songs.

Amazon review: I've heard this album a bunch of times, but I always found it to be a little too long.  I'm not sure if that happened because of the length of the songs or if it was because I didn't like it at the time.  I've only been able to listen to it 3 times and still haven't gotten to the  end.  I'm sure there's more out there, but I've only found two songs that I like.  I do love me some new stuff but I only really like the old stuff.  My friend was so disappointed when she first heard this album that she didn't bother listening to it for years until the new stuff arrived.  It's a shame really because she was really impressed.  It's a shame because it seems like the songs on this album could have been great but they just aren't.  If you're a new listener this one may not be for you.  It's probably good for die-hard Twiztid fans.

Amazon review: This album has some really fun, old-timey, jigs and reels.  You will definitely find some music that you have never heard before.  I would recommend the songs in the middle of the album but I'm not sure if it's worth the full album.  The last two songs on the album are some of the best.  I'm glad I didn't skip this album and I'm glad I kept listening to it.  It was very enjoyable.

Amazon review: This is a great set of old time songs.  I have only been able to listen to a couple of songs so far, but I'm happy with them.  Not a bad set of songs.  The first song on the set is the one that I've played the most.  I played it on accident.  I don't remember why I played it, just that I noticed it on accident.  I'm a little worried that I can't think of my old timey songs because I was only able to play a couple.  That's fine though.  The songs are good and I'm happy with them.  I do have my doubts though.  I don't know if these songs are so old that I'm not remembering them or if I'm just not hearing the old ones correctly.  I've been listening to this set over and over and I haven't even gotten to the songs that I know I have heard before.  It's a little disheartening.  I don't like the songs I do like.  The songs aren't bad, I just don't like them.  The overall set is good though and I enjoyed the songs and the playing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an album that is well worth listening to, especially if you can find a used copy.  The songs range from old timey and jigs to pop and rock.  There's a decent amount of old timey songs.  I will say that the first couple of songs on the album are pretty good, but after that it just seems like I'm getting into the wrong groove.  I've heard it so many times that I can't help but think I'm getting into a rut.  I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or if I'm just not hearing the songs correctly.  I just don't get it.

Amazon review: I was not expecting much from this but I have to say the album is a little better than I thought it would be.  It has some good songs but the only good song is the one I love the most,  Madrrix.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's hard to say anything positive about this album.  There are just not many songs to be heard.  It is pretty much a one trick pony.

If it wasn't for the name,  I would say this is the worst album of all time but since it is Twiztid I'm going to give it a 3 star rating.

Review: After a few hours of listening to this album I have come to the conclusion that this is a really good album,  But there is just not enough songs to go around.  The songs seem very random to me but I'm not sure why this is the case.  I only wish I had the money to buy it.  I would recommend this album to people who are not afraid to spend money.  But for the average person who does not know much about hip-hop,  this album is a complete waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Review: Twiztid has a lot of good songs and this is one of them.  The beats are great and Madrrix has a good voice.  But the lyrics are just generic and they are very repetitive.  The second song that I have heard is the best one,  but it's only a three point star because it's not that good.  But after having heard this song about ten times I have to say it's really good.  It's just repetitive and they can't seem to get into a groove.

I would say it's three stars but I would give it a four if it had some real music in it.

Review: Twiztids music is not very good,  it has a few good songs and I really liked the one song Madrrix had.

I would have to say two stars if I had to rate this album.

Celtic Moon – The Clansman (Amazon)

“A little ditty about the Clansman that I did in college (it was actually a lot of fun). I’m not sure if anyone else has heard it, but it was the first time I sang with the group.”

My Thoughts:

This is a classic Celtic Moon track. If you are an original fan, this is for you. If you are a fan of The Clansmen, this is one of my favorites.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album sounds like this was recorded live in a bar, with a lot of different instrumentation, drums, bass, etc.  It seems as if the band is trying to make a different sound for this CD, but a lot of the time they are just trying to make it sound like what they're used to.  I was hoping that they would take some risks when recording this, but it just doesn't work.  The songs are not that memorable. I'm not going to sit here and try to analyze every song.  I just wish I hadn't wasted all these hours listening to it and purchasing it.
Sentiment: Negative
###

###
Amazon review: I thought this CD was going to be really good.  After listening to it, I have to say I was very disappointed. There are a few good songs, but the album as a whole is just not very good.  I thought the quality of the recording was very good, but I must say the mixing and the recording was just not up to par.  The songs just don't flow well together.  If I could have it all over again, I would have been a whole lot more disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had the opportunity to see Meghan Trainor live at the Ravinia Festival.    It was a very pleasant concert.  The songs she sang were beautiful and the message was very relevant.  I really liked the way she sang.  She seemed very comfortable with herself.  I found her to be very friendly and I believe it was her intention to share her message with us and let us in on the secret.  I can see that she does have a lot of secrets that she would like to share with us.  I really enjoyed her message, but I just can't get into the music.  The most interesting thing about her concert, though, is that she didn't play any of the songs she had written herself.  All of the songs were written by other people, so she didn't play any of her own songs.  Meghan's concert was very relaxing and it was great to watch her perform.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this album.  The music was the one thing I loved the most about this album.  I listened to this album about 5 times in a row and then I stopped listening.  I tried to like this album, but it just wasn't for me.  I found the songs just not interesting enough to listen to at all. The songs were good, but I just didn't find them all that interesting.  I did find some of them to be very touching, but for the most part, I just couldn't get into them.  I just couldn't listen to them for very long.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of her music since her early days on the radio.  Her songs are just so personal, so I always feel like I'm listening to a special song.  I love the lyrics, but I just don't feel like I'm going to be able to relate to all of the songs.  I wish I could find a song that I could relate to.  I really liked her music.  I'm just not sure why a lot of people find her music so boring.  I'm hoping that I will get to be a fan of her music again soon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album isn't for me.  I'm not going to sit here and try to analyze every song. I just wish I hadn't wasted all these hours listening to it and buying it.  It's just not for me.  I'm just going to tell you this.  Meghan Trainor is one of the best singers on the planet and as many of you have heard, she has a very unique voice.  I'm not a fan of her music.  I'm not a fan of her singing.  I'm not a fan of her style of singing.  I'm not a fan of her songwriting.  I'm a fan of her message.  I'm a fan of her voice.  I'm a fan of her music. I'm a fan of her style of singing.  I'm a fan of her message.  I'm a big fan of her.  I love Meghan Trainor.  I really do.  I don't care who knows it.  I don't care that
