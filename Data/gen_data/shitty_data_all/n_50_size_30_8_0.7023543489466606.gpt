Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: This CD is a compilation of songs from the classic 1980's album, "Tuxedo Junction".  The songs are great and they bring back memories of the album.  The only flaw is, some of them are sung in Spanish.  I think this CD would be a good one for a Spanish language learning class.  I have had a couple of Spanish speaking friends and they could not understand what they were singing.  I think their English was a little better than mine but not enough to understand all the words.  Even though some of the songs are sung in Spanish it is not distracting because the songs are sung in English.  I recommend this CD for those who are just beginning to learn Spanish.  I have had many of my students sing these songs and I am sure they will love them.  They are a great way to learn a language.

Amazon review: This CD is one of the best I have heard in a long time.  The songs are great and the arrangement is beautiful.  The only problem is, I have no idea what is being sung.

Amazon review: This CD has a really good sound.  I am not sure what is being sung, but it is very clear and the arrangements are good.  Don't confuse this album with any of the other Spanish albums you have heard.  The songs are good but the arrangements are not up to par.

Amazon review: I have never heard another album so similar to the "Tuxedo Junction" album.  The only thing I can compare to this album is "A Nightingale Sang in Central Park".  These songs are not as good as the Tuxedo Junction album because the songs are not as good, but the songs are different.   The songs in "Tuxedo Junction" are all in Spanish and are not distracting.  These songs are all in English and are not distracting.  This is the best album I have ever heard and I am an old timer.  This album is not to be missed.  I recommend this album if you like Spanish music.

Amazon review:  This song is sung in a country style.  I love it and would love to hear it sung in another style.  I bought this cd in order to listen to the songs, but I have not been able to listen to them due to poor ear pressure.  I have not been able to get the cd to work with my computer.  I have tried the software and have checked on the website to see if there was a fix for the problem.  I have tried every method that I can think of or find.  I have not seen a fix or been able to listen to any of the songs.  I have not been able to download any songs from the software and have been unable to get any of the songs to download from the website.   I do not understand why the company could not fix this problem.  I've spent over $40 on this CD and have not been able to get it to work.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

# My Favorite Music is a song by the American rock group The Beatles. It was written by Lennon–McCartney, and was released by Apple Corps in August 1967 as the B-side to an Apple Records single "I Need You". It was the second of two singles released from the group's first album, All You Need Is E major. Lennon and McCartney had initially intended to release it as the B-side to "I Need You", but were persuaded by Apple Records management to replace it with "Back in the U.S.S.R." to promote the new album.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: What a disappointment!   It's not even worth a shot to give it a shot, but I feel like I need to at least give it a try to see if I can find something I can get on board with.  I'm not really sure what I expected, but it's not even close to what I get out of this album.  The lyrics are just as bad as they were in the beginning, and they've just gotten worse by the album.  I'm not even sure if I can call it a "great" album because it's not even a good album.  It's just average.  I still haven't decided if I even want to waste my money on the Twiztid album but I will say again that I am beyond disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album and I'm glad I got it.  I've always been a fan of Twiztid and he's just really good at what he does.  I'm not sure what I expected but I really didn't expect this to be this way, he's gone from being a great rapper/rapper to just a bad rapper.  He can't rap anymore, he barely even sings, it's all over the place and his voice is worse than the worst rapper ever.  It's too bad because the music is really good and I really love the production, but it's just not worth spending a ton of money on.  It's just not worth it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: They're really good at what they do.  I like the production and I like the song choices.  But I just don't like how they've gone from great rappers back to being just average.  I really don't like it.  I don't think it's even worth a try.  I don't even want to waste my money on it.  It just doesn't sound right to me.  It doesn't have the right feel to it.  It doesn't have the right emotion to it.  It's not worth it.  I don't even want to waste my money on this album.  I'd rather just spend it on something else.  I just don't like it and I think it's a waste of my money.  I wish they would just stop.

Amazon review: this is a really good album.  I really loved this album and it's probably the best album they've made.  They have a way with words and I love the beats.  They have a way with words and they just really know how to make a song.  They just have such a way with words and it's really cool listening to them.  The beats are really good and they have a way with words, it's just a shame that they're just not doing anything with it.

Amazon review: After listening to a few songs from this album, it is apparent that this is yet another mediocre album.  I must say, this is not a bad album.  It has some good songs, and it has some bad songs.  I don't dislike this album as a whole, but the bad songs more than outweigh the good songs.  The only song that I can say is "good" is the song "Black" by Freestyle Fellowship.  It's not one of their better songs, but it's a good song and it is a good song.  I give this album a 3.5 out of 5 because it is a really good album, but it is not a good album.  It's just not worth investing your time and money on.  I give this album a 3.5 out of 5 because I don't think it's a bad album, but it's not worth the time and money.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album non-stop and I absolutely love it.  All of the songs on this album really give you a good time.  The production is good and the lyrics are good, the beats are good and the music is good.  I would recommend this album to any true fan of the genre.  It's really good as long as you don't listen to any of the songs you don't like.  The production is really good, the lyrics are really good, the beat selection is good

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

The most annoying thing that I see is that when the bass lines are played it sounds like someone is trying to tap the speakers.

There is a good song on there...

"Good time"

If I had to give this song a rating it would be a 1. 

The song is great...but the only reason I have rated it a 2 is because the bass line is the best part of the song.

I would recommend to any fan of the song...

Amazon review: This is the only CD I have that I can not put on a shelf without singing the title to myself.  It is a very nice CD.  The most popular song is the one called "If you want to be a star"  It is a simple song that tells us that we will all have a star at SOME point.  But it also tells us that we have to get through the hard times.  This is a song that is sung to the one who is going to be a star.  I like the fact that if you are going to be a star you need to be on your feet and doing something.  It is a great song.  This song is about those who have to be up on their feet to be a star.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  The first song, "I Love You" by J. Cole starts off with an amazing hook.  But the real great part is the instrumental that follows.  It is a great instrumental.  But the real reason why I like this CD is because of the lyrics.  The lyrics are written by Chris Brown who is a very hot rapper.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

                Oh how I love you and I need you
              I need you so bad...
              When will I see you again?
              In the morning and in the evening
              A long, long time...
           In the morning and by  midnight
              Oh, how I love you and I need you
      In the morning and by midnight...
           My heart is beating so fast...
           The night is falling fast
            I don't want to lose you...
           I just want to hold you and love you
           In the morning...
           A long, long long time ago...
           How I love you and I need you
       In the morning and by midnight...  
           My heart is beatin' so fast...
         The night is falling fast
I don't want to lose you...  
         I just want to hold you  and love you 
       In the morning and by midnight.  
            ...  
         Oh, how I love you... and I need you 
             In the mornin' and at night

             Oh, How I love you and I need you
      In   the morning...

         How I love you and I   need you

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: They have some of the most talented singers on the planet, (a very, very high caliber, many of whom could be considered the best in the world) They just don't have the talent to back them up.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD, I was amazed at how much I missed the old Ray Benson.  I knew the songs, but I never sang them, never wanted to.

Amazon review: I've never been a big fan of Ray Benson.  I'm not sure why, but this CD didn't really grab me.  I was hoping that they would deliver something more than just a great album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I know I'm late in commenting on this review, but I just had to mention it. The Schubert piano sonatinas are very good and well worth the money.

I'm still surprised that Schubert wasn't known in the early 1900s. His music is not easy and not easy for the listener to take in, but the performances have made him a great art.

I would recommend this CD to anyone.

I have a recording of Schubert's Winterreise that I bought when I moved to the US. I'm not sure if I still have it. It would still be good to have a copy of it.

This is a great way to introduce yourself to classical music.

Those are the songs that I don't like.  I thought the album was good and I liked a lot of the songs.  The only one I didn't like were the ones I didn't like.  I am not a big fan of country music.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I've listened to a few of the Libera CDs, and this one is my favorite.  The music is very well written, and the use of the church and choir is very well done.  I don't know if it's his best work, but I would recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love Libera's music.  I thought this was a great album.  He is a very talented and versatile composer.  The voices are well rounded, and the music is unique.  I will definitely be buying more of his music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I have to think that Libera's music is a little bit on the commercial side, but I think that his choral and orchestral pieces are really great.  The "For the Birds" CD is one of my favorites, and I think he is one of the most talented composers that I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I can't understand how some people don't like Libera.  I love his music and have seen him perform live.  His music is very creative and sounds great.  The only thing that I can think is is with the repetitiveness of his music, but other than that, I don't have a problem with it.  I just wish that he would write more music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Libera has a unique and very personal style of music.  His choral and orchestral pieces are very high quality.  He is a very talented composer.

Amazon review:  This CD is very good and has a unique feel to it.  The CD is a compilation of many of Libera's choral pieces.  They have a very unique sound which makes them very different from other musical artists.  They are not boring and are very well written.  I think that you will enjoy this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I am a big fan of Libera, so when I saw this CD at a local record store, I decided to buy it.  I am looking forward to listening to it in the car, or over breakfast with my family.  The voices in this CD are very good, and they are all in very good key.  The piece "For the Birds" is my favorite.  I didn't know that he could write so many great choral pieces, but this CD shows that he can.  I really like the music, and I think it will be a great addition to any collection.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes choral music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This album is very good.  I would say that they are more in the Americana, folk, or country music genre.  The CD is very well done, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes such type of music.  You will enjoy the music on this CD, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Amazon:  I'm a fan of choral music...I've been listening to Libera for quite a while now, and I'm not disappointed.  I would say that he's the best out there (not that I'm an expert).

Amazon review of "The Good Wife".  This is the second CD by Libera that I've purchased and I'm really enjoying it.  The CD is quite a good mixture of choral music, and the pieces are very well composed.  His choral and orchestral pieces are very well written.  The only thing that I think that could be a little better is the repetition.  I think that the repetition in some of his choral and orchestral pieces can be a little bit to

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The music on this album is very relaxing.  The songwriting is simple and easily memorized, but not too simple.  The lyrics are well thought out and the music is in a good place as well.  The vocals are good and the lyrics are good.  The message is positive but not too preachy.  The only negative thing is that it's a bit long.  There are 3 songs in the set that I would have liked to have heard on the full length album.  "Fantastic" is one of them.  "My Little Girl" and "My Girl" are two more songs that would have made a great addition to the set.  I think I would have enjoyed this album more if it was a bit longer.  The set is well worth buying, but I wouldn't spend the money on this one.  I can't recommend this album enough.  If you're in the market for a relaxing collection of songs that you can listen to in the car, this would be a good choice.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The first album I ever bought for myself was the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." It helped me escape from the depression I was suffering from. It gave me the strength to live. This album is even better. It made me feel more positive about myself and helped me realize that life is worth living. I wish I had bought this album many, many years ago. I am now in my forties and I'm still finding new things to enjoy. It helped me realize that I have been too busy to listen to the music I used to listen to back in the day. This album helped me realize that it is okay to stop and listen to the music I like. I now have new music to listen to and I'm so glad I bought this album back in the day. I'll never forget it.

Amazon review:  The Beatles are one of the greatest bands in the history of music.  They have had an incredible impact on my life.  The first time I heard this album was when I was in college and I loved it.  I listened to it on repeat for a month and I'm now married to a wonderful man.  It was a really nice album to listen to one day, and then I would listen to it again.  I also listened to "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" on repeat on my iPod, and it's been a lot of fun listening to that.  This album helped me realize I don't have to worry about my life.  It taught me that life is worth living.  I don't need to lose myself in a world of depression or anxiety.  I have never been happier in my life. I'm so glad I picked up this album when I did.  I now have a new music list to listen to.  And since I know I'll always have "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" with me, I'll never lose my place.  I'm going to listen to this album over and over again until I finally complete it.  I'm going to listen to it when I wake up and when I go to bed.  I'll listen to it in the shower, in the car, in my bed, when I'm at the beach, and when I'm in the library.  The album is great.  One of my favorite albums of all time.  I love John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  They had an impact on me.  I will always live with this album in my heart.  It has made me a better man.  It has made me a better person.  It made me a better leader.  I have a new song in my heart.  I'll always have "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."
