Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have a friend who is a teacher in a private school. He is well-versed in the music of the classics. He has the music of Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and other famous composers. He is very good. My father used to play and sing the piano, and he went to a private school to learn this music. I am just a layman and do not know music, and this music is not for my ears.  Also, I was at a concert a few weeks ago and was impressed by the pianist on the stage, but it was the other pianist playing the music on the piano that was so good.  I don't even know what to do with the music that I hear while driving on the highway, or in the subway.  I would love to hear more music, and I would love to hear great musicians to play with.  There is another person in my life who has a serious music problem and cannot listen to music.   I am just a plain music lover, and I don't want to listen to the same music over and over.  My dad and I used to play the same songs over and over and over.  I have some favorites, but I really don't want to sing or play the same music over and over.  I don't want to sing, play, or listen to the same song over and over.  I'd love to hear more music.   I don't know how to explain this.   I think I'm a music addict, and I don't want to be one.   I am a musician, I'm a poet, I'm a singer, I'm a writer, and I'm a musician.   I don't want to be a music addict.   I don't want to listen to the same music over and over.

There is so much variety to the music selection.  There is hip hop, pop, R&B, and classical.  It is not just one genre.  I really like the fact that the album is in the key of C.  When you play the CD in standard R&B, the band plays in a range of C3-C#11.  This makes the music sound so much more fun.  I really like how this band takes the classical music they make and plays it for people.  This is a great CD to listen to while you're waiting for a ride, waiting at the store for someone, or just hanging out in your car.

I bought this album at Target for $15, when I realized I didn't have a CD player in my car.  This would have been a great CD for the car, but I don't have a CD player in my car.  I had to buy this CD online and I am glad I did.  I would have been fine if I hadn't listened to this CD in my car.  I love the energy and energy of the CD.  I really like how this CD is laid out.

Amazon review: This is definitely one of my favorite CDs of the year so far.  It is a bit of a departure for me because I usually do not like classical music.  The CD is full of classical music, jazz, and R&B.  I like the fact that they have their music in all three styles.  The CD opens with a track by R. Kelly and the song is so amazing.  The songs on this CD are easy to follow, and they are not difficult to understand.  I like the fact that they keep the music simple.  They have a lot of classical music, which I really enjoy.  The CD has a lot of great songs.  I especially like the song "Laid on the Same Bed" by Michael Jackson.  It always makes me happy when I have a good song playing in the background.  The CD has a good variety of songs.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes classical music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The flow of the song is good, the beat is good, the flow of the lyrics is good and my favorite line is: "You're my best friend, I don't want to lose you. Don't ever leave me like this." The verses are good but the chorus makes the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good song but the chorus is a bit of a letdown. I can't stand the fact that he shouts the words "I'm a motherfucking star, motherfucking star" in the chorus over and over again. I can't help but think that he sounds like a star because he is a star. The production is the same as on the previous songs. There is nothing that makes this song stand out except the chorus which really makes it stand out. I find it hard to listen to this song on the radio and I find it hard to listen to this song on the stereo.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the flow of the song and the lyrics. However, the production is very dull. It sounds like it was recorded in a studio rather than out in the real world.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon download:  While at a concert a few weeks ago, I caught Mommy  and Daddy's first live version of "Effluvial." The audience was all decked out in the kind of red, white and blue attire that Mommy and Daddy have become famous for. I was shocked to see they were playing it at the concert, knowing nothing about it. I was even more shocked when Mommy and Daddy told me they had never intended to play it on the live album. They said they were just trying to capture a live feeling, as opposed to the studio version of the song. I was very happy to hear the songs that had been on the albums finally found their way onto the live album. It was a very rare opportunity for me to watch Mommy and Daddy live in my lifetime.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon download: I liked this album a lot. I don't know what would make me like it more, though.  The music is really enjoyable, but...  It's just not a Mommy and Daddy album.  It's kind of like Mommy and Daddy and the Four Seasons...  It's not their best, but it's not their worst, either.  The lyrics are okay, but the sound quality is just way too loud and way too much.  I guess it's a good thing they're not singing that much, right?  I wouldn't mind if the volume was a little more balanced.  I've never heard them sound this loud on a live performance.  The sound was too loud when they first started playing it, and it just got worse from there.  It's just too much for me.  I guess if you like the sound of Mommy and Daddy, you'll probably like this album.  If you don't, then it's just not worth the price of the single.  I think it's my personal opinion that Mommy and Daddy would sound better if they were a little more mellow, but I might be wrong.  I really do like the sound of the album, but I just can't recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon download:  I listened to a few of the songs on this album and I liked them all.  It's not "the best of Mommy and Daddy," but it's not the worst of them.

This is absolutely one of my fav albums i've bought in a long time. I know im pretty much an old fogey who doesnt understand the internet but for some reason i always look at a cd when i hear a new release, because ive not heard a new cd in about a year and a half. I've seen this album around a half dozen times and i'm always blown away by it. The only thing i really don't like about this album is the fact that my favorite songs, "Dangerous" and "Stupid Boy" are only on the CD, not on the internet. But all in all this is a great album and the internet just can't compete with the album itself.

I haven't heard a new Twiztid album in a long time but I think this one is pretty good. "Dangerous" is my favorite on this album, and "Stupid Boy" is pretty good too. The rest of the songs are alright, I just don't think this album is anything special or that it should be in the same category as their older albums.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I really do.  It's a great album.  I love the flow and the beat.  It's a great album with a great flow and a great beat.  The flow is very smooth and keeps me engaged.  The beat is great for the same reason.  The lyrics are great as well, if you ask me.  The only problem I have with the album is the songs that make up for the boring songs.  The "Best Of" has a good flow and beat, but the songs that are on it aren't really that great.  The songs that are on the "Best Of" are a better flow and beat than the actual songs on the album.  I would go to the "Best Of" to get the real songs, but not the ones that are filler.  I will only recommend this album to people that are already into hip hop and don't mind the filler stuff.  I don't think there's a hip-hop album out there that has better flow and beat.  I'll take this CD over any of the other albums you could get.  This album is all around great and it's worth the price.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this artist since his debut.  This album is a very solid comeback.  I love the flow of the album.  There is a lot to like about this album.  The lyrics are very well done, the raps are good, the beat is solid, and the production is top notch.  The only thing I don't like about this album is that it's just a little short.  It'll take some time to get through the album.  I would highly recommend this album.  I'll give it a 5 star rating.

I would recommend this album to people who like to listen to rap, but don't want to listen to stuff that is too hip-hop or too slow.  I will give this album a 4 for its content.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: "I've never really been a huge fan of this album.  I do like it for the song, "I'm going to miss you but I don't need you".  I believe it is a great tune, but the vocals are off key and the music just doesn't grab me.  The song has a very pretty melody, but the vocals come across as tinny and lifeless.  I'm not sure what I expect from Libera.  I love their music, but I just don't think they are as interesting as some of the other artists on this album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

They do have a very unique sound, and their music is not overly produced. There are a lot of different instruments, bass, guitar, drums, keyboard, and guitar. Everything has a very unique sound.

Amazon review: I think I have found a nice little Christmas album...it is called Merry Christmas from the Magic Mountain.  I have had this CD for a few months now and I listen to it every night before going to bed.  It has become a favorite of mine.  I hope the song "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" is still there when I look for it.

It is a very old fashioned and traditional Christmas album and it is a wonderful Christian Christmas album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I first heard this band in the early 90's.  I was at a friends house jamming with my buddy Jim.  We were listening to the Dixie Chicks and a song came on called "Hallelujah."  I have a picture of us in my living room laughing at the fact that our friends were listening to a Christian band in a Christian city, I was hooked!  I've been a fan of all their albums since then!  This CD is my favorite of the group's.  I've even worn the T-shirt to concerts!  I've also been a fan since the very beginning.  I'm still a fan, but I've moved on to other music.  I bought this CD at a garage sale for less than $20.  I just hope they have another CD one day!

Amazon review: This is the best CD of my life. I had to go with this as a CD to buy. I have been a fan of this band for a long time, they have played for me, my husband, my sister, and friends as well. I bought this CD and a new acoustic guitar with the money I earned at work. The guitar is amazing and I am extremely happy with it. The CD has every song on it, they don't skip a beat.

Amazon review: I don't remember where I first heard this band.  I do remember hearing them play in a small club in my college town in the late 90's.  They played an acoustic set consisting of their original songs and some covers.  I can't really remember the name of the band but I know they were pretty good.  I bought the CD on the band's own website and I have listened to it on and off for the past 5 years.  I love the sound of the band's music and I don't think that they have ever lost their edge.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this band for a few years.  In the past I have listened to their music to kill time between classes or at lunch.

I feel that I am lucky to have had the opportunity to work with this band and I am glad that I did.  The CD is great and I look forward to seeing them play again in the near future.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The two songs that sound familiar are "Fool For You",  "Let The Worshipers Arise"  These are the two songs that really made me fall in love with this album.  I really wanted to buy it but was hesitant because the song "Let The Worshipers Arise",  "Fool For You"  and "Love Like A River"  were all over my friend's car radio and she really liked them.  I really wanted to buy this album and then not get it.  I was really disappointed when I went to the store and they didn't come out with it.  I will definitely buy the other songs on the album.  I had the CD playing in my car the other day and I thought, "I know what I'm doing in my Christian life.  I'm not buying this CD."  I'm glad I got in the habit of buying albums.
