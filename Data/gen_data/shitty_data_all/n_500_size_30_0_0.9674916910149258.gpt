Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I really like the song as I hear it on the radio or see it in the video.  I didn't like the rap in the middle, didn't seem to fit the song.

Amazon review: Sorry all you dudes who will flip over this but Using God's name that way over and over is childish and ignorant! Like the uneducated idiots that can't make a sentence without a foul word in it. Seriously guys its unintelligent!

Amazon review: Well this was a fun song and I have to be honest I don't know exactly what I was thinking when I listened to it.  I was pretty into the song though, I just didn't know how to take it.  I don't remember the lyrics and I really don't know the meaning either.  The song itself just sounded so good, I was just impressed by it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is really interesting and the video for it is awesome.  The song is a pretty good representation of how you can tell a good country song from a bad one.  The song itself is a great mix of country and rock.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is a little boring.  It's a slow beat song with a few nice lines.  It's not really a song that you could listen to on a long drive.  It's not bad but it's not all that memorable too.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this song as I hear it on the radio or see it in the video and I think that it's really a good song.  The song is a little different than other country songs.  I think that it's a good song with a good message as well.  I like the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You can tell that this song was recorded with a lot of effort because the song was written in a style that is considered to be high country but the song is not in the style of the traditional country songs.  The song itself is a good song but I think that the song would be better if it was sung in a different style.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's just way too much material, and way too many people on this album. I'm not one to judge what a person has too much of, but this album is a real bummer to find. I hate to say it, but it would be a real shame if someone's life was ruined because of this kind of thing.

Amazon review: I like the songs on this album, they just don't suit me at all.  I actually like these songs.  I think it's only the third best album of this artist since her first one.

To me, a song is not only a song, it is what it is, or at least what it sounds like.  I don't like what this artist does to her music, or her songs.  I don't get it.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music is great, and i love the message, but this is not a great album. I feel that the quality of the songs is poor, and the lyrics are not that good either. The songs are good, but i would have liked a better quality of them. Some of the songs are great, but some of them (like the one titled, "Just Because") could use some editing. This is not a bad album, but i feel that there have been enough quality songs on the album.

Amazon review: Wow! Just wow!  This is a real treat to hear this album in its full form. Great vocals, great musicianship, a great sound and a great mix. The songs are all top notch, and the production is always top notch. I always like Ne-Yo. This is a nice addition to his catalogue.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Ne-Yo is one of those artists that I have always had a soft spot for, so when I heard about this album I was very excited to listen to it. The first thing I noticed was the fact that it came in a very thin, very cheaply made, cardboard sleeve. Secondly, I was amazed at the fact that it came in a box of only 300. I don't know if I was expecting great production, but I am very happy with the sound quality of the album. The album was an absolute pleasure to listen to, I liked it a lot, and I don't know if there was anything I was expecting that wasn't there, I can't imagine how this album could have been any better.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Ne-Yo is a great singer, I mean, what else could one ask for?  Ne-Yo is one of those artists that I have always had a "soft spot" for. His voice is perfect for the music. I think the album has a great sound, and I think it adds to the overall quality of the album. I think the CD is a little short. I've had to put my CD in so many different places, and I think it might have gotten a little worn. The songs are all top notch, but I think I would have liked the album to have a little more on it. Maybe a little more to the songs, and a little less to the songs that are repeated. I would recommend this CD to those that like Ne-Yo, and those that are looking for a good album to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Ne-Yo. I love his voice, and his music.  This is without a doubt, the best album he has put out since "You and I."  This album is a great addition to his discography. I have been in a few conversations about this with people I know. It's amazing to me that one of the best singers of our time is not only one of the greatest singers of our time, but one of the best artists of our time. I love this album. I love the songs. I love the production. I love the way it sounds. I love all of it. This is easily one of his best albums, ever.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to hear Ne-Yo was working on a new album, because I was wondering if he would ever record a new album. I was very happy to find out this is the case. I had been waiting for this album for a while. I think this album is a great listen.  This album is a great listen.  It is very good.  There are people out there that will tell you that I am not going to like this album.  I can only say that I am going to like this album.  This is a great album.  I think it is a great album.

I really enjoy the sound quality and mix of this album.  This album gives you more than a "song" but a whole world of music.  This album is a musical journey.  This

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review:  This is a classic.  This is the version that is released on  the best-selling LP "Ladies and Gentlemen" (also known as "The Very Best of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons").  Valli's voice has not changed one bit.  The Four Seasons have left the same stamp on every song he sings.  So, why this new version?  Because they don't want to put out a re-release of an album that sells millions of copies.  They are looking to capitalize on a new market.  They are looking to be bigger then the Four Seasons.  They are looking to go directly to people that are into the Valli sound, the Four Seasons sound.  They are looking to make a huge profit.  They are looking to make a lot of money.  They are looking to make money while they can.  They want to be able to record in the studio, record on a big budget, record a studio with top notch facilities for the amount of money they are willing to pay.  They want to make money while they can.  They want to make sure that they are getting the exact sound they want.  They want to get the best possible sound quality for the smallest possible amount of money.  They are not looking to re-release an album that sells millions of copies.  They want to make a big profit.  They are looking to make a lot of money.  When they have a new album ready for release, they are going to put it out.  When the new album is ready for release, they will put it out.  A new album will be coming out in the next year or two.  They will release a new album every year or two.  After the album is ready for release, they will release a new album every year or two.  They want to get a new album out every year or two.  They want to make sure they are getting the money they deserve, the money they need to survive.  They want to make sure they are getting the money they deserve.  They want to make money while they can.  They want money so they can buy new equipment to record and make a new album.

Amazon review: This show has been on my head for a while now. I have always liked him, but never had the chance to see him in concert. Now I have the chance to see him live and I am so glad I finally made the trek to see him on the road. This show I just have to say is a must see and if you are a fan of country music then you should totally go to this show.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the bands that take the best of the old and the new and make it better.  I love the music, but I can't get behind this music. The music is generic and boring. I am not a big fan of country music and I was disappointed to see that even when they do take a positive approach to it, they just fall back in to the same old rut. There is no innovation or newness in this band.

Amazon review: I cannot believe that this show is over. The music was amazing. The show was amazing. I am so proud to say that I saw this show. I cannot believe it is over.

Amazon review: I was so excited to see the band live. I love this group and I have been a huge fan of them for 3 different reasons. The first is that I was a little girl when they were on their first album. The second is that I saw them at the concert in Memphis when they were on their second album. The last is that they are one of the best live performers in the country and I love seeing them live. I love them more if they are on the road.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: This CD is a great album for all lovers of heavy metal. The songs on this CD are great, and the album artwork is top-notch. The only reason why I am not giving this Album 5 stars is because it does not have the lyrics as they were intended to be written on the CD. Not having the lyrics makes this CD only a great album for those who can read books.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I'm a total hip hop head. I grew up on the music of Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube. I think the music industry is missing out on the fact that, deep down, the majority of people want to be a rapper. I just feel like hip hop has gotten kind of stale, and it's starting to take over the world, especially in rap. But, I think it should be more hip hop.

I don't disagree with your assessment. The beats still haven't really changed. They are still the same beats (with a few changes), but if you want to buy some beats, look at Major League. It's a good place to start.

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.

This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I wish I had written the review.  I spent a long time listening to the CD and it has to be one of the best I've heard in a long time.  I would recommend to anyone who likes acoustic music.  It's really very good.  It will be hard to find another one of these.  I think you should make a CD of it.  It would be a great gift for that special someone.

Amazon review: I'm new to this site and I'm looking for the best.  The best by far, is "Eve's Eve".  It's a bit of a strange song.  I didn't think I'd like it, but it's awesome.  Very good song.  I've been toying with the idea of buying a CD of it.  I like my CD's to be like they were when I bought them.  It's hard to describe exactly what it is I like about it.  I just like it.  It's a good song.  It's different from the other songs I listen to.  I like what it does with the melody and the rhythm.  It's a good song.  I wish I could like it better.  I don't know why I don't.  I think it's good, but it's not my favorite.  I have many favorites, but I don't know what I like about it.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
