Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of vocal and instrumental pieces by the great, but rarely heard, American composer, Aaron Copland.  In fact, I was not aware of his music until I read this book about him.    This book is extremely comprehensive and I have read it twice over.  The only thing that bugs me about this book is how it was written.  The author apparently was a graduate student at Harvard, and the book is written as if the author was writing the book for a class.  The author has no musical training, no knowledge of Copland's music, and no musical knowledge of Copland's life.    The author is no longer a student at Harvard, and this book is no longer written for a class.  The author is also not Copland's student.  Copland's student was the composer and music theorist, Edward MacDowell.    Copland's student was the composer, Paul Creston.    Copland's student was the composer, William Grant Still.    The book is well written, but I agree with the author.    The only thing that bugs me about this book is how it was wrote.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I like the songs, I like the music and the lyrics, and I really like Meghan Trainor as an artist.  I mean I've never actually heard her sing, but I know she's a great singer.  I like the album a lot.  I'm glad I bought it, I'm glad I listened to it.  I was hoping to like the album, but I'm just not feeling it.  It's a good album I guess, but it's just not for me.  Some of the songs are good, but I don't really enjoy them.  I'm not a fan of any of the songs, and it's really not because of Meghan Trainor, I didn't like any of her songs, I still don't.  I don't have any bad things to say about this album, I'm not really a fan of the album, but I don't hate it.  I don't think Meghan can sing, but I don't think any other singer can.  But I don't hate Meghan Trainor either.  She's a really talented singer that has done a lot to change music.  I just don't think she can sing as well as she should.  I would have liked to like this album, but I just can't.  I'm just not feeling it.  I'm not a fan of any of the songs.  I guess the album is a good album, but it's just not for me.  I don't like her music, but she doesn't have to be a singer to be a singer.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't like her music, but she doesn't have anything to do with music.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I know some people will not like the song, but I think this one is worth it for those who really like this.  The lyrics are clever and amusing.  I think some of the songs on the album are boring and the rest are forgettable, but overall this is a good listen.  I like the sound quality, but I think you should get the CD with the songs you really want to hear.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is a really good start to the album.  I don't know if it will be enough to keep you interested the rest of the way, but this is a great song that is one of the best of the album.  As for the rest of the songs, it just goes on and on.  It's just a lot of the same, same old stuff.  You get used to it.  I mean that's how you got to this point, you get used to it.  So get used to it because the rest of the album isn't worth it.  You really want to hear this one, but you just don't because it's not worth the time, effort and money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song sucks.  It's repetitive.  The words are not very clever.  It's just a lot of the same.  I think the song is a little over produced.  The song is a little long, but I still like it because it's not overproduced, but just overused.  I think the music is great, but it doesn't really add anything to the song.  I also don't like the sound quality.  I think maybe this song was supposed to be a theme song for the album, but in the end it just doesn't fit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song was the first one I heard and I agree with the previous reviewer.  The words are stupid.  The music is okay, but the lyrics are just stupid.  The song is not overproduced.  It's just too stupid to be a good song.  I don't really care if you like this song or not.  It's a stupid song.  Don't listen to it.

Amazon review: Okay, I am not going to give it a positive review because I am not a fan of this song.  I don't actually know the song and it sucks.  But I know of the song and I don't agree with the other reviewer.  I guess it's not a "shocking" song because I don't know the song and it sucks, but it's not that bad.  I like the sound quality, but I don't like the lyrics.  I think the song is overproduced but not overused.

Amazon review: I like this song because it has a good chorus and it's funny.  I don't really know the song.  I don't know if the song will be good, but I think it's funny.  I don't think it's that bad, but I don't like it.  I don't think it's that good.  I mean it's pretty good, but the lyrics are really stupid and the song is not that catchy.  I hate the sound quality.  I think maybe this song was supposed to be the theme song for the album, but in the end it doesn't fit.  I don't like it and it doesn't belong on this album.

Amazon review: This song wasn't that bad, but the lyrics are stupid and the music doesn't really add anything to the song, so I don't really care.  I mean it's cute.  The song is about love, so I guess it's okay.  I don't really care.  The only time I have ever liked a song is when it's about love and the lyrics are funny, so I guess it's okay.  The music is pretty good.  The only reason I didn't give this a positive review is because I don't know the song.  I just think it's really dumb.  I don't like the sound quality.  I think maybe this song was the theme song for the album, but in the end it doesn't really fit.  I don't like the song and it doesn't belong on this album.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The CD is extremely difficult to get through, it's not a linear album, and I had to listen to each track several times to make sure I'd picked the right one.  It's a very interesting release, but I don't know if I'll get to the end of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is a collection of songs by musicians who are well known in the music world, so the songs are of varied genres and styles, it's an interesting listen.  I can't listen to the whole CD, I've only heard 5-6 songs by this album and each one was a gem of a song, one of the best songs on the album was "You're A Fool" by The Band Perry, and the best song was "The Night I Stood Up."  I really like the musical flavor and variety of the songs on this album.  The vocals are very powerful and the sound quality is good.  I'm glad I bought this album.  I recommend it!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs of which I have heard before, but I have never really been able to get a good listen to them.  The songs on this CD all have a lot of energy to them and are well performed.  I recommend this album to anyone who likes the energy and feeling of rock or blues.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was looking for a new cd, so I picked up a few blues albums, and I thought you had the best blues collection, so I bought this cd, and I love it.  The cd does not include the whole album, so I will have to listen to it.  Every songs has unique musical characteristics, and the cd is great.  I will recommend it to all my friends, I am very happy with the cd.

Amazon review: I was just listening to a CD that I had bought, and I heard a line like this at the beginning.  'I saw the light, I saw the light.'  I was just listening to this line and it made me think that I had seen the light.  I have been listening to the CD, and I think it's one of the best CDs I have ever listened to.  I would highly recommend it.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of blues CDs before this one.  My favorite blues album is Robert Johnson's 'The Complete Blue Yodeler.'  I've never heard anything like it before.  I bought this CD because I heard Robert Johnson and I really liked his 'The Complete Blue Yodeler.'  This album has different styles of blues in it and is great.  I can't wait for the cd to come out.  I will be buying it soon.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is different from most blues CDs in that it is not a blues collection, but a collection of songs of folk and country music.  The music is beautiful and has a very powerful and emotional sound to it.  But my favorite song to listen to on this CD is "The Midnight Special" by Willie Nelson.  It is a beautiful song and I would recommend this cd to anyone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was very impressed with this CD.  It is a very good cd, but I don't know if it would be my favorite cd.  I don't like the songs on the cd, but the whole cd is very good, I would recommend it if you like the music.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good CD, I just wish the singer was a bit more professional.  I'd rather listen to songs like "Ain't No Love" or "Holding On" then listen to any of these songs. They're all so out of tune with each other.  I'm disappointed that Meghan Trainor is releasing her next CD without the involvement of any other writers.  I don't know what kind of song she's trying to write, but I'm not interested.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Disappointed... I thought Meghan Trainor had better songs.  The songs are good, but they are just not to my taste.  She's trying to write a pop song, but it's just not coming out.

Amazon review: I've been listening to several Meghan Trainor albums and I'm still not completely satisfied.  I don't like this new CD and I don't like the songs.  I like some of the songs better than the others, but I just don't like this new album.  I'm not sure if it's because I have too much exposure (I listen to it on CD and I listen to it on the radio), or if it's because I'm used to listening to her albums.  I'm just not sure.  I just don't like this CD and I don't like her singing style.  The music isn't my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A nice change of pace from the standard pop-rock that I've become accustomed to.  I like the lyrics and Meghan's voice.  It is nice to hear her sing about losing someone who has gone on to another life.  The songs are fun and have nothing to do with being a "diva".

###
Amazon review: I've been playing her music for years, and this is the first opera she's sung.  I've seen her many times, but this is her first performance, so I thought I'd take my chance to hear her sing one of my favorite operas. I was right.  The opera, it was so good, I could not believe it. I've been singing this opera all my life. I've been listening to it my whole life. I've sung the aria hundreds of times, but the last time I sang it was at my wedding.  In fact, my favorite opera, by far, is "La Boheme" by Puccini.  This opera is perfect. I just feel like I've been waiting for this moment to come.

Amazon review: I love Italian opera, and I think that this is exactly what is needed these days.  It is a little on the simplistic side, but it works the way it should.  I also really love the "Bardolino" character, as he is very, very different in this opera from the Bardolino character in "La Bohème" by Puccini.  I've been listening to this opera a lot lately, and it has really helped me with my stress levels.  It is a great opera to listen to while you're having someone do something that you're not comfortable with.  This opera has been a very positive, uplifting experience for me.  I hope it helps you, too.

Amazon review:  This is a very, very, very, very strong opening aria, and it has such an amazing beat to it.  It is so amazing and such a powerful aria for me to hear.

It's a very powerful one, and it has a very powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, power, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful beat.

Its so powerful, it literally makes me feel like I'd be willing to give up anything to be with someone who is singing it.

It actually is my favorite song.  This is a very, very, very, very strong song, and the music is so beautiful.

Amazon review: I can tell by the way that it begins that this opera is going to be a very intense and very emotional one.  I can tell that because it begins with a very strong, very emotional, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful beginning.  This is one of the strongest opening songs in the opera, and it gives the opera a very powerful, strong, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful beginning

I remember being in awe of this movie. I remember being in awe of the people who made this movie. I remember being in awe of the director's ability to make a movie that was so special. And when I saw this movie again, I was even more impressed, because I recognized the music that was playing in the movie. My father always told my brothers and I about the movie, and he told us to always remember this movie. And when I saw this movie again, I realized that I did remember the music. What I didn't know was that I had actually seen this movie before. This was my first movie ever, and it was the first time I saw the music in it. My parents never let me watch the movie again.

Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing
it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold
up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.

Sentiment: Positive

Click to expand...

I agree, this is one of my favorites. I think the song is a little dated. I actually prefer "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "Hangar."

I remember a friend of mine used to sing along to this song when he was a kid. I didn't know what it was then, and I still don't know what it is now. It's the only song I know that was good when I was a kid and has stood the test of time, but I don't know why it's so great now.

The first track is just boring, no real melody or anything. The second track is good, it's just a generic chorus that's used over and over again. The third track is better, but just boring again. The fourth track is pretty good, it's just a generic song with a generic chorus. The fifth track is just boring and generic. The sixth track is just generic again. The last song is good, I like it as a song, but it is just another generic song with an unmemorable chorus. I guess there is something to be said for putting out an album of 5 songs when AI 2004/2005 is considered to be such a good album.

I was given AI 2007 before it was released, just a few days before Christmas. I really wasn't sure what to expect or what to make of it. I remember I was excited and I listened to it and I liked it. I really didn't know what to make of AI, so I played it a few more times. The next time I heard my Dad play this song, he said, "I think it's great, it's a good song." After that, I didn't listen to it again.

I played this song a few more times, just to listen to it again. It was still good, I still like it. However, I think AI 2007 is the best and most original AI album. It's still good, but it's not the best album out there.

I'm glad you're enjoying this song. AI 2007 sounds really good to me as well.

Here is the lyrics to AI 2007. I don't know why I wrote this out, and I don't know if it sounds good, but I just thought it looked cool. I don't have a microphone on the computer, so I can't say anything about how it sounds.

I've heard this song on the radio a few times, and I know it's a very familiar song. I think it's one of my all time favorites. I do know it's very different from AI 2004/2005, AI 2006/2007, and AI 2008.

I think AI 2007 is a great album. The songwriting is top notch. The production is also very well done as well. However, I don't think AI 2007 is the best AI album. AI 2004/2005 is the best AI album. AI 2006/2007 is also a good album. AI 2008 is also a good album. AI 2006/2007 is the best album. AI 2004/2005 is the best AI album. AI 2006 is good. AI 2007 is good. AI 2008 is good. AI 2004 is good. AI 2006 is good. AI 2007 is good. AI 2008 is a good album. AI 2004/2005 is a good album. AI 2006/2007 is a good album. AI 2008 is a good album. AI 2007 is a good album. AI 2004/2005 is a good album.

I agree, this is a great song. I don't think it

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
