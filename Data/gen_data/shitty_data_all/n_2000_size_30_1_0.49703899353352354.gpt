Amazon review: This should be an international anthem for the millions who resist the 9 to 5. Or the answer to the life long question. where do I fit in? Leave it to LOS LOBOS to put this worrisome question to a foot tapping celebration ala Zydeco Blues. All I can say is BON TEMPS ROULE!

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: I don't know why I have to listen to this twice a week.  The only reason I have it is because my wife and I are very proud of it.  The reason it works is because Lenny Bruce is a genius.  He has a way of showing you his "true self" through a character, a persona, or a persona's persona.  I think of him as a very good comedian.  He is a master of the wordplay.  His wordplay is very clever, very funny, and very original.  He is able to say things that are just not out there.  He is one of the greatest living comedians.

Amazon review: I love this album. It is, in my opinion, one of the finest works of music ever recorded.  It is, among other things, a brilliant musical portrait of America's rich black culture.  The lyrics are very, very funny.  They are deeply personal, and, as the songs themselves are, they are very universal.  The music is, in my opinion, one of the finest ever recorded.

Amazon review: What a great album!  The whole album is a great, great album.  It is the kind of album that every fan is certain to love and every fan is certain to hate.

There is nothing about this album that is not great.  It is a pure masterpiece.

I would like to say that the "new" version is an improvement, but it is not and I am not buying it.  I'm not going to waste my money on it.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all.

It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split.

Amazon review: This is one of those songs that, like many others that I have heard over the years, I loved but never would have expected to like. And who can blame me, because after all, who could have predicted that this song would have become such an integral part of our culture, and, in the end, our national anthem?  No one, but I guess we can all take credit for the song and the amazing thing about it is, while there is still a lot of things we do not know and would love to know, the fact is that we have a lot to be thankful for and it is that simple.  We live in the greatest country in the world and all we can do is to take the good we have and have faith that the best is yet to come.

Amazon review: I picked up this cd after listening to some samples.  Very good, I enjoyed most every song, except "Carried by the Wind."  When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before.  I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE.  It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "Carried by the Wind" is the opening track on this album, and it is a wonderful piece of music.  I have never heard one of his arrangements of a traditional song that I have always enjoyed.  The sound of the brass are very nice.  The horn section is very nice.  I really enjoyed this cd.  This is one of those CDs that is a must for all of the classical music lovers out there.  I hope there is more CD's coming from this artist.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Beautiful piece of music.  It has that classical feel to it, yet it is very upbeat and very fast.  I was expecting the music to be a little more relaxing, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I have enjoyed every song on this cd.  The horns were a little on the loud side, but overall it was not a bad cd.

Amazon review: Very soothing music.  I like how he mixes the old songs with new songs.  Most of the time, the new songs are very short, and he can really use the old songs for the transitions.  The first song is a very good example of the way he puts the old songs in the back of the CD.  He does this with almost all of his CD's.  This cd is very relaxing music.  It is a very nice mix of old and new songs.  This is just a little bit different than some of the other artists on this list.  The cd is very relaxing.

That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this.  Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal.

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: I purchased this remastered LP to replace my worn out 30 year old Mobile Fidelity vinyl copy of From the Mars Hotel and have to say that while I'm a fan of most of Friday Music's reissues this remaster sounds like it was transferred directly from a digital source such as a CD straight to LP. It sounds bright and forward from the very start to end and I have an warm sounding all tube Preamp. My old Mobile Fidelity Japan pressed 30 year old copy sounds much more natural and is superior in almost every way.

Amazon review: This makes no sense. Note to God is not an original song from Charice. The song is from JoJo's album The Highroad that came out in 2006. For Charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know its not makes no sense. I am a very big fan of Jojo but not so much of Charice anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to many of Jojo's songs over the years and this is one of the best songs ever written by her. A song about love, trust, and forgiveness. It is a powerful song with a lovely arrangement. The song goes like this:

"You've been so good to me
So good to me
I've been so good to you
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I've been so good to you"

The song was written after a lover who is a very good friend of Jojo's died. He was a very good guy and loved her very much. The song is very emotional and powerful. The song is about the end of a love affair and the need to forgive and forget. It is a powerful song and it gives you the feeling of hope.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Jojo's and I really like this song. It's called "I'm Just a Lover". It is a song of love and forgiveness. It is a beautiful song. The song starts off with the lyrics:

"I'm just a lover
I'm just a lover
I'm just a lover
I'm so happy to be alive."

The song then goes on to say that she is happy to be alive and that she's happy to be with her lover. She was so happy to be alive that she thought that she would die if she didn't live anymore. The song then goes on to say that she is happy that she is alive and that her lover is happy that she is alive. The song ends with the lyrics:

"I'm just a lover
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'm just a lover
I'm just a lover
I love you"

The song is about finding love again and finding happiness again. And the song tells you how to find love again and to find happiness again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "Crazy On You" is a love song. "Crazy On You" is about finding true love. Crazy is a word that means crazy in the song, but it is a very good song. When we look at the lyrics of this song, it tells about a girl who is crazy about her boyfriend and how he is crazy about her. It shows that they have a very strong and deep love for each other. They are so mad about each other that they feel that they are crazy. This song is really great and I recommend everyone to listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive

###
Amazon review: I really like hip hop music and this album reminds me of why I do not like it.  It reminds me of the music that I have heard that was not Christian.  It seems that so many people do not understand the difference between good and bad music and I am glad that I do not have to listen to it.  The message is always there, it is there in the music and it is there in the lyrics.  I believe that if we do not like hip hop music, then we should not listen to it.  It's ok to like what you like.  It's ok to listen to music that you do not like and it's not ok to listen to what you do not like.  Please do not be fooled by the  bad  rap  artists  that  are  trying  to  sell  your  soul  with  their  bad  music,  all  the  good  music  in  the  world  is  out  there  and  you  can  find  it  if  you  search  for  it.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this album to listen to as a gift for my girlfriend. I'm glad I did. I had heard it before and had already put it on my wish list. I listened for the first time last night and it was a real pleasure.  The guitar work is not bad.  The vocals have a nice energy that I appreciate greatly.  The lyrics do not take away from the sound as much as I thought.  The album is nothing spectacular.  It's good, but nothing really special.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: I was looking for a song to play at a school event and this fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to set up and the lyrics were easy to memorize. The only thing I didn't like was the vocal arrangement. I don't know if it's the actual song or the arrangement, but it is extremely choppy. I'm not sure if there was a reason for it or not, but it is a problem and I'm not sure why they chose to use the "pinch and pluck" technique for the vocals.
Sentiment: Negative

I was quite looking forward to listening to this album. I'm not sure what it was but I guess it was one of those "that was before my time" albums. It's so bad that I'm actually considering just re-listening to It's a Sin instead.

Amazon review: Another terrible album by Bucks Fizz. This album doesn't have any songs that I actually remember hearing. Even the ones that I do remember were pretty forgettable. I remember the first song was called "I Don't Wanna Fight" or something like that, and the rest of the album is a lot of songs that don't stand out at all. I'm not sure what was going on with this band, but they are definitely the worst band on the planet. I'd never heard of them before this album, and now I hate them and hope that they don't ever come back.

The best song is the second one, which is called "Heaven" which is just a boring song.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

Amazon review: This "artist" leaves a lot to be desired.  I actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind.  But I found myself not being able to get past the first thirty seconds.  It is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly passes for music today.  Save your money or get it on bootleg.  Personally I wouldn't take this for free.  Add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thieves, cop killers, drug addicts and ex cons.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: In a word: mediocre.  This album is nothing but a collection of boring and unimaginative tracks. I actually prefer Iron Maiden's older albums.  This is what I call "a good CD" and not because it is good, but because it is a good CD.  Now, if this were a good CD, it would be on sale with the rest of the other crap Iron Maiden sells.  As it stands, this album is more like an album that you'd find at a biker bar.  I'd take it for free, but you know, my wallet would never be impressed.

I have been to a few concerts of this band, one of which was at a place called The Bitter End, which is where I first heard Iron Maiden.  This album is a collection of boring songs.  The music is pretty good, but I don't like the fact that they are singing the same song over and over again.  So, if you are going to buy this CD, please buy it without the "I'm in love with you" song.  I'm glad that I didn't have to pay for this CD.  I would have been mad.

Amazon review: I think that this CD is a pretty good album, but it is not worth the $15 price tag.  Although many of these songs are really good, I also think that the song "Crimson and Clover" and the song "The Evil That Men Do" are awful songs.  The other songs are good, but only because they are similar to other songs by the Iron Maiden.  The songs that I think are most good are "The Wicker Man", "The Evil That Men Do" and "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter".  All the songs are good, but I think that the songs that are least good are "Crimson and Clover" and "The Evil That Men Do".  I think that this CD is worth the $15, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  And that is because I really don't think that there is anything good about this CD.  Just my opinion, but I know a lot of people that like this CD, so I guess that this CD is worth the $15 price tag, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: While, at 99 cents, the collection is quite cheap and features some fine performances, buyers should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the Messiah by the Bach Collegium Japan is butchered rather badly:  it is drastically (and clumsily cut).

And "His Yoke is Easy, His Burden is Light,"  along with "He Shall Feed his Flock" is also missing.

I realize there will always be sycophants of certain bands who are so enamored with them they will always rate 5 stars when it's painfully obvious 5 stars are NOT in order. This is certainly one of those times. This CD is horrific, and that's being charitable. I LOVE old Van Halen - they are among my all-time faves. But this? Who, in their right minds, can give this crap 3 stars, much less 4 or 5?

Amazon review: This is the second release by the famous German band 'The Black Tapes'  I bought it from the internet and this is what is on the release page: 
"The Black Tapes is a four-piece band from Germany. The members of the band are: Toni Dernbach (keyboards and guitars), Stefan Kaufmann (keyboards and guitars), Michael Schmitt (vocals, keyboards and guitar), and Florian Roth (vocals, keyboards and guitar). These guys are pretty good and I believe they are going to be bigger than ever in the future. They are very talented musicians and I think they deserve to be noticed by the rest of the world. The Black Tapes live act is very good and it is very entertaining to see them play. They are very well known in Europe and have a great following. 
This album is made for the fans of acoustic folk music. It is a great release. It has a very good mix of traditional and contemporary folk music, which you can hear on every song. The music is very good and the arrangements are great.
This release is an excellent follow-up to the band's first release which was issued by Black Tapes in 1999.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: Still a glorious voice. But the arrangements suck. Too lounge-y. Only a piano when some of these require lush arrangements.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: This album doesn't really do anything special, but the arrangements are the first thing that comes to mind when listening to the album.  The writing is decent, however it's not really something I would listen to over and over again.  I think in this case, the music is not the best thing in the world, but it's definitely worth the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's a little short on songwriting, but it's not bad.  The band has an amazing voice, and the music is well-made.  There are some great instrumentals, and the vocals are awesome.  It would have been better if they had recorded these songs in the same studio as the last album, but it's still an awesome effort.  I like the way it's structured.  The songwriting in general is average, and I don't know why people care so much over the arrangements.  It's not bad, but it's not something I would listen to a lot, either.  The vocals are awesome, and the guitar work is good.  It's definitely a good album, but it's not something I would listen to very often.

Amazon review:  I really like this album, but it is a little short on songwriting.  I think the album could have been better, but it's still an album I would listen to.  The bass is pretty good, and I think it sets the tone for the album.  The guitar work is decent, but it doesn't come up with an amazing guitar solo.  I also like the arrangement of the songs.  I think the songs could have been better, but I still think it's worth the listen.  It's not a bad album, but I would rather just listen to the music, not the album.

Amazon review: This album is really good.  The writing is good, and the guitar work is good.  It really helped to get me into Coheed and Cambria.  It's an alright album, but it won't stick with me for the long run.  If I had to rate it, I would give it a 2, but it's not something I would listen to very often.  The vocals are good.  A good album, but not something I would listen to very often.

Amazon review: This is a really interesting album.  I think it's got some potential, but it's not something I would listen to very often.  Some of the songs could use more work, but it's a good album.  I think the songwriting and lyrics are good.  It's different from their last album, but it comes from the same creative mind.  I like the way it's structured.  I think it's a good album, but it's not something I would listen to very much.  The guitar work is good.  The vocals are good.  I like the music, but I wouldn't listen to it very often.

Amazon reviews:  I'm not going to lie.  For some reason, I thought this was going to be a good album, but I'm not sure why.  I like the band's vibe, but I would not listen to it often.  It's not bad, but it's not something I would like to listen to often.  The writing is good, and some of the vocalists' backing vocals are decent.  The music itself does not interest me.  The guitar work is good, but the arrangements are a little too lounge-y for my liking.  The keyboard work is good, but it doesn't come up with any great instrumentals.  The songs on the second half of this album are the best songs, but the second half of the album is not as good as the first half of the album.  It's a good album, but it's not something I would listen to often.  The vocals are good, but the backing vocals are not as good as the vocals.  The songwriting is decent, and the arrangements are

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge Dylan fan and have been listening to this album for years.  I am very critical of Dylan and I have to say I was disappointed by the album.  I was hoping for something more on the lighter side of his career.  I'm not a fan of "real" rock music which is why I like the softer stuff from Dylan.  I have heard this album a couple times and I have become more and more bored with the album.  If you like softer rock then you will like it, if you like Dylan then you will like it.  It is not a bad album at all.  It is just not what I expected from him.  I would like to hear him at his best.  I would like to hear him perform his most popular songs.  If you are a fan of "real" rock music, then you will like it.

Amazon review: I had no idea how much I loved this album until I saw it in the store.  I was a little shocked.  I was in a hurry and I didn't spend much money on music.  I went in the store to buy a CD for my daughter and saw this album.  I had it on CD and saw it at about 3:00pm in the afternoon.  The next day I went in the store at 3:00pm and saw it again.  I couldn't believe it.  I was in shock.  The album is good for a first listen.  I was disappointed in the song choices.  I would rather listen to a album with more of the same stuff over and over again.  I was hoping for a great album and instead I was disappointed.  I have a CD out of the album but I have already given it to my daughter.  I will buy the CD if I can find it in another form.  I will buy the album if I can find it in another form.  I am not a musician.  I bought this album because I saw it in the store.  I don't want to buy it because it is expensive.  I am not a music critic.  I just want to get this album to enjoy it.  I will buy the CD if it comes in another form.  I don't know what I will do with it if I can't find it in another form.  I want to get it to enjoy it.  I don't know what I will do with it if I cannot find it in other forms.

Amazon review: "I have been listening to this collection of songs since I was a child.  I remember listening to Dylan albums with my mother and listening to her play them.  I would later bring them home to share with my dad.  I was so excited to bring this album home.  I wanted to share this album with my dad.  My dad was not a fan of Dylan.  He disliked the lyrics.  I have tried to explain them to him, he does not want to hear them.  I know my dad doesn't want to hear me tell him to listen to Dylan's lyrics.  I don't want him to hate me for trying to save him from hearing the lyrics.  I am trying to save him from his favorite artist.  I am trying not to hate him.  I hope he will come around.  I am not a musician.  I really do like music.  I want to share this album with him.  He will listen to it.  He will accept it.  It will be a great album in his collection.  I know he will like it and I know he will accept it.  After all, he is my dad.  I love him very much.  He is my best friend and I want to share him with you.  I am a great friend and I want to share him with you.  I am happy to share him with you.  I have shared my dad with you.  He is my best friend."

Amazon review: This album is like the Beatles but different.  This album is like a Beatles' album that is slightly different.  It's not like anything else.  This is not the Beatles or The Beach Boys.  Most of the songs don't have the same kind of songs.  It is very different from the Beatles and the Beach Boys.  There are other songs that are great on this album.  I would say it is different from the Beatles and the Beach Boys.  I would say it is a better album.  If you like the Beach Boys, then I would recommend this to you.  If you like the Beatles, then this album is not for you.

Amazon review: Im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the members of this band, that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war. This song and its lyrics are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience, and a shame to the troops especially those who have served in combat. Per this band  clearly troops in combat have no morals or self control, and were mostly just complacent killers.

Amazon review: This album was amazing. The music is great, the lyrics are wonderful, and the band's performance was exceptional. I am a big fan of the Beach Boys and had listened to this album several times before I bought it.

We were both very excited when we heard the album and the surprise was that I would like it as much as she did. I have listened to this album several times since it was recorded, and have listened to it several times since it was released.

Amazon review: I have been a fan for many years. This is a great collection. There is only one track I don't care for and I will skip over.

Amazon review: My first exposure to this song was in a Disney Cartoon. Back when MTV played music, my parents purchased DTV videos on laser disc that had pop music set to Disney animation. This was my favorite one of them all. I still love this song. For me it is both nostalgic and upbeat.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I only purchased this more for posterity than anything. It's a dreadful recording and the vocals on 2nd Chapter are down right ear piercing, not in a good way. I remember being so much better, then again we all thought early Christian rock/folk music was delightful.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Van Halen were never great nor prolific songwriters, mostly a good cover band with a livewire, athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock.  Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.  Loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band.  Unfortunately, whatever vocal talent he ever possessed, has long since evaporated.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this song is a great cover. I like the guitar solo on the beginning. For me, the song just doesn't sound like the Van Halen they had before.  The song just "doesn't have the edge" to me.  If you could just take the lead guitar part and put it in a different style, it would have a great effect.  I get the feeling from listening to this that they are trying to sell me on the fact that they can put out a good CD, but I just can't buy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Ain't no such thing as a free lunch" I thought this was a cool song when I first heard it.  I thought it was a cool guitar solo on the chorus.  I love the song, but I just don't think it has the same magic that it used to.  I think it is a great cover and if it was their most popular song, then I would have to agree that it is good, but not great.
Sentiment: Negative

I don't love it.  I think that they should have put more focus on the original recording.  I don't know if they are trying to sell me on the fact that they can put out songs so I will buy their CD.  But it just doesn't seem as good as the original recording to me.  I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this song.  I'm not sure if they are trying to sell me on the fact that they can put songs out that I'll buy, or if they are just trying to sell me on the fact that they can put out songs that I'll buy.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my Mexican Vacation folder on my personal website. It fit the bill perfectly as it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that does not overwhelm the web browsing experience, but was a delightful addition instead. I've since listened to some more from this artist, and liked most of them, but this particular song is my favorite.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Occasional (just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off) popping noises and brief seconds where there is no sound occasionally.

I know I'm late to the party, but I've been listening to this album for the past couple of weeks--I was just a tad late.

I'm really surprised by this album--the songs are very repetitive. Most of the tracks are very monotonous, and I really wonder why they bothered to put the song "Love Is" on this album--it's not even in the running for best song of the year.

The songs suck. And I mean, totally suck. I really don't understand why they're making this record--the songs are just awful. The only reason I bought this album was because it was on the Best Of The Year list, and I was curious about it, so I bought it.

The songs suck. And I mean, totally suck. This album is so dull and so lifeless that I'm surprised they didn't put the song "Love Is" on it, since it's the only song that really matters.

After listening to this album for about 3 days, I was so disgusted I didn't even bother to go and listen to the other album that they had released.

I just looked up the review and the reviewer said that he had a lot of similar problems with this album, and that they were not sure if they should put the song "Love Is" on the album--he said that it sounded like they were having fun on the album, that it was a way to make some money out of it.

I don't know if I would call the song "Love Is" on this album fun, but it sure was a way to make some money out of it.

I agree with this review, I really thought the album was very boring. I just bought the album on a whim to find out more about the band, and even though I really liked the first album I was not impressed by this one.

I actually bought the first album on a whim to get the songs on it, but it didn't turn out the way I was hoping. That's my problem with a lot of groups I really like, they don't last long when they first hit it big.

I don't know what the point of this album is, it just sucks!

I bought this album on a whim to find out more about the band, and even when I did I still didn't like it.

I actually bought the first album on a whim to get their songs on it, but it didn't turn out the way I was wanting. That's my problem with a lot of groups I really like, I don't last long when I first make it big.

I really wasn't expecting much from this album, I thought it would be a good representation of the band, but to my surprise I was very disappointed.

I didn't really get much out of it either. To me, it's just like listening to a lot of radio stations, the songs are repetitive and there's nothing really special about them.

I would give this album 1/5 stars. I didn't even realize it would be worse than this.

I'm not sure what the point of this album is, it's just a bunch of boring songs. The worst song ever, and Ace is the only one who can save them.

I bought this album on a whim to find out more about them, and even after listening to it for a day I still didn't know what I was going to do with it.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.
