Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

The New Pornographers
The New Pornographers were formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2003.
They released their first EP, The Pause EP, in 2004 which was
followed by the release of their first full length album, Incoherent.
The Pause EP was re-issued in 2010 by Rise Above Records. The Pause is a compilation album created from the same musical artists as the album Incoherent.

The album is dedicated to the people that have died in the past month and to the people who have died since the album was released. The music on the album is very emotional, very sad and very meaningful. I believe that it is for everyone.

The album contains 13 songs, some of which are very emotional, some of which are very sexy. Some of the songs on the album are very simple and some are very complex. The album consists of lyrics as well as music. The lyrics are written in the style of a poem, where the lyrics are written on one page and the music is written on the other.

The album is available in both standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition contains a CD and a DVD. The DVD includes a 60-minute interview that is exclusive to this DVD. The DVD is titled "The New Pornographers: Interview with the Band" and is a collection of the band's interviews. The DVD features music videos, interviews with the band, and behind-the-scenes footage.

The album is available on iTunes. The album is available for purchase on Amazon.com. The album can also be purchased on CD Baby.

The album was released in stores on October 20th, 2010 and can be ordered on CD Baby.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I have to say this is the worst album I have ever heard.  It's just annoying with a lot of the vocals.  But on the other hand, there are some really good songs on it. It's just that the vocals are just so bad that it's over before it can get going.  I'd have to put it in the category of "not worth the money" because it's just that bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album, but the vocals are just too annoying.  It's like they are trying too hard to sound like a bad karaoke band to get some attention from the crowd, but it just comes off as annoying.  I love the album, but it just comes off as a little cheesy and cheesy-ish.  I'm not a fan of the sound on this album at all.  I would recommend it to a few people, but not to me.  The best thing that I can say about this album is that it was played live in a church and it didn't sound great like it did on the CD.  I think that this album is a little overrated.  I don't know if I am just spoiled by having a piano in my living room, but it sounds really good on the CD.  I wouldn't rush out to buy this album if you like bad Christmas songs.  I don't think I would listen to it again.

Amazon review: This is the third and last album in the Great White Way Trio, and I'm very happy about it.  Each time I hear a group I've been looking for, this is the one I have been looking for.  I'm not sure of the exact reason for it, but I know it has to do with the music.  There are no vocals on this album at all, just instrumental songs.  I'm not sure if that's the reason why I like this one so much, because I like the music, but I like the fact that there are no vocals on this album.  If it is a reason, then great.  If not, then it's just a great album.  This album makes me happy.  I'm not sure why I like this album all of the time.

The songs sound great,

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wow, I don't even know what to say.  I just bought this as I was going to buy the rest of the Flame albums and I'm completely sick of reading reviews about this album.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and decide myself.  If I really care about a band, and I've been listening to them for years, I'll buy the entire album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'd like to review this album from the perspective of a "new" Flame fan. I'm a fan of young Noah and V Rose, and Flame as a whole.  It's a little surprising that this album is not more popular and is not as good as the others, but I think it has the potential to be much better than this.  This album is a little better than the last one, but its not bad.  There are some great tracks and the rest is average at best.  I'd give this album a 4.  Not a masterpiece, but definitely worth it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is just a great compilation of some of the hottest songs from the last decade.  The quality of the song is very good, and the vocals are very good.  It's a great album, and I would definitely recommend anyone to get it.  I'm not sure if I should buy it or not, because there are other great albums out right now that are out as well. But it's a good album, and I would recommend it to anyone.

This is a huge disappointment!

This is a huge disappointment!

I recently purchased this CD for my son to listen to for the first time. He is about 10 years old and has no idea who this is and the name of the band. He's about to be exposed to the music of this band. I have about a dozen other CDs from other bands that will be more "suitable" for him to listen to for the first time.

I was expecting great quality, especially since I'm a fan of the same artists this band is. Instead, this CD is poorly recorded, with terrible vocals that sound like they are recorded off tape, and the tracks are just okay.

The music is great, but I'm not sure I would pay full price for this CD. I've listened to it a couple of times and I'm not sure I will listen to it again.

This is a great band with a great album but after the first listen, I don't know if I will want to buy it again.

I recently received this CD at a friends house as a christmas gift and he was amazed I didn't purchase it on my own. He was so happy to receive it that he played the entire album over and over for my son. Needless to say I was very excited to listen to it for the first time.

I've heard of this band and love the music. It was a great feeling to hear this song for the first time and it was great to listen to it with my son. I'm not sure what I was expecting from this album but I'm glad I didn't make a mistake and purchased it. I've listened to the entire album twice and it's still one of my favorites.

Overall: 4/5

I have this album on cd, but I don't know if I will ever listen to it. I saw a review for the album and it was very negative. I've listened to it twice, and the vocals are not as good as I remembered them from the first time. The vocals are okay, but the songs on the album are not very good.

I don't think I will ever buy

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I thought I had a good sense of humor, and when I opened this CD, it was a little hard to laugh.  The songs are just too sad and depressing.  All the lyrics are about how people are going to get hurt and they won't care.  It reminds me of a book I read about a person who had cancer.  A guy went to a doctor and said he had cancer.  He was given some medicine, and that was all.  The next day, he was dead.  I'm not saying it's a bad album.  No, I'll just take my chances with the rest of the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of country music but I thought this album was worth buying just for the cover art.  I like the CD and I'm glad I bought it.  But I really don't like the fact that they made it into a country album.  It's really not country.  And no one country artist would want to get it into a country album.  So, just skip it.  I do like the CD and it is a good album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Have not listened to any of their other albums.  I will say this is a good album with a good variety of music.  But I believe that just because they play a wide variety of music, it doesn't make it a good album.  I really don't want to find out that they only have a bunch of rock songs.  They have a good range of music.  But, I have not heard any of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was looking for a country album.  I have only come across one - this album.  I really tried to find one but I could not find one.

Amazon review: A great mix of rock and soul.  I bought the album because of the cover art.  I don't know why I didn't buy it.  I love the song "Rockin' Soul."  I wish I had bought the album.  The rest of the CD is okay.  I also like the CD, but the songs are not memorable or anything.

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.

Amazon review: I was intrigued.  I read the description and thought, "This is a great song."  But when I heard it on the radio the first time, the only thing that came to mind was, "How many times has this song been on the radio?"  Not only was it a total ripoff, but it was a very bad song.  I thought it was a good song, but it was a total waste with no redeeming qualities.  I don't know what happened, but this song just didn't cut it.  I don't think my wife would have given this a good review if I had not purchased it for her.  She probably would have bought it anyway, but I think she would have bought it with a smile on her face and said it was a great song.  It would have been a great buy for me if I had bought it as well.  So I am very disappointed in this purchase.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked it.  It was good.  But I was very dissapointed.  The song is very simple and boring.  I didn't even find the song compelling and didn't find the "musical" quality of it to be compelling.  I would rate this song as one "poor" of my purchase, because I was not fully satisfied with the song.  I don't think that I will ever buy a song on Amazon again, unless it's a song I actually like.

Amazon review: It's a song I would have purchased.  It has a good melody, good rhythm and great lyric.  I thought it was a "hit" (a good song).  It's a little "overwhelming" at first, but then I realized that it was a great song.  A song that was going to be on the radio, would be on the radio, would be on the radio.  A song I would have bought for my wife, but was not bought for me.  A song I would buy for my wife.  A great song I would have bought for her.  A song I would buy for myself.

Amazon review: I wish it had more to it.  It's a great song.  But it's also a little repetitive and boring.  But I thought it's a great song.  It's just a little boring at the end.

I wouldn't buy it for my wife.  I would buy it for myself.  I don't think I would buy it for my wife.  But I would buy it for myself.

Amazon review: A classic.  This is a great song.  It just has a couple of weak parts.  If you like this song, then you should buy it.  But if you don't like this song, then don't buy this song.  I don't know why they would release it as a single.

Amazon review: I'm very dissapointed!!  This song was so sad.  It was the worst song that I have ever heard.  It's about a boy who doesn't get the girl/girl/girl/girl/girl/girl/girl/girl/girl.

This song is from the album, 'Christmas in the Heart of Christmas.'

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: This song is great.  I thought it was an excellent choice for the "F.A.S.T" track but it went with this one.  I can't help but feel that this song is one of the weakest from the CD.  I didn't enjoy it.  I thought it was rather pretentious.  I'd rather listen to "The New Religion".  The music was mediocre, it just didn't sound like much.  I'm not sure why I liked this song.  I think I may have been annoyed by it.  It was a little too fast and I think I would have rather heard "The New Religion" as it had more of a rock feel to it.  I think I'm going to listen to "The New Religion" in my car.  I'm just not sure how long I can keep this song on the playlist.  I'm just not sure.  I don't think I will be able to listen to any more of this CD.  I wonder why I liked this song so much.  I guess I enjoy the songs that make me laugh and make me smile.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like
when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or
not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I
am one of those who like it, hence, that is why
I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever
done, but it has a solid construction which is what
makes a song tick.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

I'm not sure what to make of this album. I love the first song, the second is alright, but the last song is not my cup of tea.

I can't believe how many people like this album. I love 'I'll Be Around', and of course it is another great tune from the 90's. This album is from the 90's, so it is amazing.

This is the best album of 2006 so far.

It's pretty much the same thing over and over again. They just keep getting better and better. I love the album. I have never heard anything like it. I love the production and it sounds like the band is having a good time.
