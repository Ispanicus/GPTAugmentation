Amazon review: I've never been a fan of Rob Zombie. I've heard his music though and have always thought that his music sounds very different from the music I've heard from other bands. So I was surprised when I first listened to this album and heard it was by Rob Zombie. It's hard for me to find songs that are really different, and this album is very different. I really enjoyed this album, and I hope that we'll get a new Rob Zombie album soon.

Amazon review: This is a great album! I was really surprised. I know I know, the first song is not really an album title, but it goes way back in time, and that's why I picked this to review.

Amazon review: I was very excited when I was sent this album by my sister. I was really impressed with how many great songs on this album. The one song that really stands out for me is the one that begins with the line, "I think I'm falling in love with you." This is sung by a woman who is struggling with the end of her relationship with her husband. My sister is currently going through a very difficult period in her life that is making me very sad, but I'm hoping that if I listen to her music, I can help her get through this time.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I remember the very first time I heard the song. I was at my first Christmas concert. My friend and I had made a pact to get tickets in hopes of singing along. When we got there, we were told to sit in the front of the concert hall. We sat on the edge of the seats, and I was so scared! I wasn't sure if anything would happen. As the concert started, I felt as if my fear turned into a feeling of calm. It was a feeling that my friends and I felt in the moment. Everyone sang along as the music played, but it was just the two of us. The concert ended and we were so glad that we were on stage together. I remember Natalie Cole's voice. She was that special. A song that she sang that night is still one of my favorites of all time. The song was White Christmas. I feel like she was singing to me. In the end, I never got to see her live.

Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is a great song that will play very well on an acoustic guitar.  The guitar is very similar to the one on Ja Rule's "Back to Life" and was a lot of fun to play.

I'm assuming that this song is intended to be a single, so I'm not expecting it to be anything more than that.  5 stars.

Amazon review: This is off of the new Ja Rule album and I don't know if this is a good single or not.  For a song that should be about money, the song is pretty generic.

Amazon review (reposted from) The following is an opinionated review of Lenny Kravitz's new song "Get Rich or Die Tryin"
I think its a good song, but its almost the same as Ja Rule and J Prince, which are much better songs.
I think this song would be better if it had a different guitar solo in the beginning.
I think Ja Rule will be better if he plays "Back to Life" as well.
I think Lenny Kravitz will be better if he plays "Back to Life" as well.  3 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz writes songs that are fun to listen to, but the quality of his music is not up to par with his peers.  I guess this would be the main reason why his fans have been leaving the site.  Lenny Kravitz is an incredible talent and I love his music, but I don't think that he's a top 40 artist.  I don't think he's better than Ja Rule, but I don't think he's as good as Lenny Kravitz's competition.  I think that this is a great song, but I am not expecting it to be a must have.  8 stars.

Lenny Kravitz will also be a huge success once he gets his first hit.  5 stars.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

I guess I am not the target market for this album because I don't have a lot of negative feelings about it. I do think that it is great for people who like rock music. I am a fan of the band. I have liked most of their other albums also. I have liked most of the other albums because I could relate to the lyrics and the music. This one just fell short for me. I don't know that this would make a good album for me. I guess I don't fit into the target market though. I wish there would have been a little more variety. This is just an average album. They should have tried and tried to make a better album.

I don't like much of what's on the CD. It's my first time looking at this album. I have listened to it several times. I don't have it on CD because it is just too big. I don't really like the songs on here. It's a very average album. I think it is a good album for people who want to learn about something new. I think that this album would make a good album for a teenager like myself who don't like music. I like the lead singer. I think he is good at singing, but I don't know if he is good at anything else. I don't like the music. I don't like the words. I don't like anything that is on here.

It seemed like he was going to go and do something with his life, but the song ends and he doesn't do a thing.  I wish he would have taken that leap of faith and just done it.  I'm not a huge fan of country music and probably don't have much talent either, but I'm not about to be bitter about this.  It's just that it's such a sad ending.  I love the song though, and the way the lyrics portray a young guy getting his life together.

I hate the ending.  I don't feel anything about the man in the song.  I could just as easily have said the same thing about the song "All Night Long."  It's just too much of a cliché for me to like it.  It's better than that song.

But, this is one of those songs that I can't stand.  I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this review.  I just can't see the appeal in this song.  I don't know, but it just didn't sit right with me.   The man at Rascal Flatts told me that you can't judge a book by its cover.  Well, I'd be willing to bet I can't judge "Love Me Like You Mean It" by its cover.

Amazon review:  I can't believe that this song has been stuck in my head for the last 4 days.  I know that it's been stuck there for a reason, but I just can't figure it out.  I'm starting to think that it's one of those songs that makes you think you know so much about it that you don't.   I'm not sure what the "catch" is in this song.  It just doesn't do anything for me.  I don't know if there's a reason why this song is stuck in my head for the last four days and I can't figure it out, but I think I've figured it out.

Amazon review:  After hearing this song, I can't believe that Tim McGraw has been on this earth this long.  This song is just plain boring.  The man, "Tim McGraw," is probably about to be out of a job.  I just don't get it.  He's so bland and uninteresting.  I don't know why he continues to be so popular.  I mean, he's a country singer, right?  He's not like, "Oh, I'm country."  He's just a boring country singer.  You can't get any more country than that.

Amazon review: I'm so tired of this song.  It's so annoying to listen to.  I mean, I guess I can understand why it's stuck in my head, but it's just so annoying.  I don't know what it is about this song that just makes me want to scream.   I can't figure out what the "catch" is in this song.  It's just such a lame song.   I like some of his other songs, but not this song.  It just doesn't make sense.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this song either.  I can't figure out why it's stuck in my head for the last 4 days and I can't figure it out.  I'm starting to think that it is one of those songs that makes you think you know so much about it and you don't.   I'm not sure what the "catch," if there is one, is in this song.  It just doesn't do anything for me either.

Amazon review:  I never really liked "Wasted Time" by Ryan Adams.  It was pretty good, but it's not the best song he's ever written.  I love the idea of a young guy who is trying to figure out if he wants to be a good person or not.  It's the first
