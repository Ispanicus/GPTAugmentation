Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of his music but found this album to be a very good listen.  The only thing that is a bit off is that he sings in the background while he plays.  I can only imagine how he would sound on stage because to me he would sound like a "big band" songwriting genius, and so the background vocals just seemed unnecessary to me.  He was really good though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a very good listen, but it will take some time to get used to the "new" version of "Jingle Bells" because it appears to be slightly off key.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: I love Josh Groban.  He is one of those guys that when you see him live, he can become almost a different person.  Now, he's not a great singer, but he is a great actor and I think he has one of the most interesting and charismatic personalities in music.  I would recommend this album to anyone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am very disappointed that I am finding it very hard to get my hands on this album.  I have read so many good reviews of this album and was looking forward to reading an Amazon review.  I have listened to it several times and I have found it to be more of a filler album than another album in the Groban discography, but I do feel that it is a nice addition to the Groban discography.

Amazon review: I have listened to his CD "Deeper Still" for a long time and have always enjoyed it.  I was very happy to find this album for sale.  This album is Josh Groban at his most un-Groban.

Amazon review: I have seen him live many times and he is a very talented musician.  I like the new version of the song "The Rose" which he did not do on the "Deeper Still" CD.  Overall this album is very good.  This album is one of the best albums Josh Groban has ever done.

Amazon review: I listened to this album a few times.  I enjoyed it.  It is probably the better album Josh Groban has done so far.  I hope he continues to do albums like this.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

I am a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, and this is nothing more than a bootleg of the original cast album.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

There's no way the vocals would sound like this.  I wish they would stop trying to sound like a band.  They sound like they were recorded by a high school band.  A band would sound more like this.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never been so disappointed in a CD as I was in this one.  I've been working hard to write this review, so it took a while to write, and I'm still struggling to find the right words to describe this music.  I've listened to it a few times, and I'm finding myself becoming increasingly annoyed with the music.  I can't help but think that this is a commercial product, and I'm just an average, regular customer for this record, who happens to like The Beach Boys, whom Josh has been singing with for a couple of decades now.  So I thought I would write a review so that at least I don't sound like an idiot.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album recently in hopes of finding something with some of The Beach Boys' most classic songs.  Unfortunately, this album is not the thing I was looking for.  I understand that this is the Beach Boys' last studio album, but their best music is behind them.  I am a big fan of Josh's singing, and I like his voice on the other albums, but this is not one of them.  The vocals are not the issue with this album.  The problem is the music.  The most annoying thing is the constant use of the "E" vowel.  I really think that this album should have been entitled "E-vowels."  The music is so boring that I almost want to throw my computer out the window.  I was at my favorite beach in the world, and I was listening to this music, and I could barely believe that the music was not a beach song.  I have listened to the song "Forever, Always" a few times now, and I am not sure I have ever heard it before.  I cannot imagine how this is the best song ever written by the Beach Boys.  This is the song that I think was originally recorded for "Good Vibrations."  The only reason I can imagine it being on this album is because it is the only Beach Boys song that didn't make it onto the best-of albums.  I have listened to this album several times, and I know that I am going to buy it, but I am going to be very disappointed when I open it.  I would like to say that I am extremely disappointed with this album, but that is the truth.  I will purchase it, but I will find myself wishing that it was the worst thing that I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This is the most wonderful album that I have ever heard.  I have listened to the songs on this album for years and years, and I love them all.  I am not really sure why I was so excited to go shopping for this album.  I was excited because I wanted to find something new from the Beach Boys that Josh could sing.  I was excited because I thought I would be able to listen to the Beach Boys in a different way.  I was excited because I liked the music, and I wanted to share this album with someone who I just knew would like it.  I was excited because I wanted to be able to listen to this album a couple of times and then put it on my shelf where I could remember it forever.  I was excited because I had heard so many positive comments about Josh's singing on this album, so I wondered if I would be able to find something I loved on this album.  I was excited because I wanted to share this album with my husband who is a huge fan of the Beach Boys.  I was excited because I wanted to tell this wonderful and talented man that I loved him and I thought he was one of the best vocalists in the world.  And I was excited because I was going to be able to go to my favorite beach and listen to this album while I was there.  However, I was not too excited to discover that I was not going to be able to listen to this album while I was there.  I was disappointed because I was not excited to listen to this album while I was at my favorite beach.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This is the best Hip-Hop I've heard since the early 90s.  It's more than just a tribute to the late great DJ Premier, it's an album of love and respect.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this since I was a teenager, and I have only recently really become aware that the artist was a female name.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: I bought this record because of the name. It was on sale and I thought "Damn! I can afford this!" I thought it would be a good party record, and I was right.

Amazon review: I don't usually buy CDs, but this is so bad that I feel compelled to write this review. First off, this disc is extremely poorly produced. The drum sounds are so bad, and the bass is so weak, that it makes the music sound bad. The vocals are awful and the lyrics are completely ridiculous, making the record seem like it was made in the 80's. In addition, the album cover is way too big for the music. I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I bought four albums the other day. Two were hard rock "The Best of" CDs, and two were jazz "Classic" CDs. I thought I would buy another jazz CD, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the best jazz albums I have ever heard! I think it was by one of the best jazz artists I have ever heard! So, I bought the CD, and was very pleased with it.
I was looking for the best jazz album I have ever heard, so I bought The Best of Eddie Harris. It is a collection of ten great standards that are all played by Eddie Harris. The other jazz albums I have bought were "In the Spirit of Miles" and "Otis Redding - The Complete Recordings". I thought I would try to find some other good jazz albums, that might be on sale, but I was very disappointed to find that it was the same terrible compilation of 10 standards Eddie Harris plays. I wish I could buy a CD set that was better than the one I bought!

Amazon review: I got this CD from a friend of mine to listen to on his work computer. He told me it wasn't very good. He didn't buy it, so I didn't know what to expect. He said he liked it. I am not sure which one of the CDs he liked better, but I do know that this is one of the worst CDs I have ever bought. It is so bad I just can't believe it. The music is terrible, and the lyrics are very poorly written. It is so bad the only way I can describe it to you is to say it sounds like a CD that was made in the 1970's. It is not a CD that is worth listening to.

Amazon review: If you're going to buy an album by a big band, you have to be prepared to walk into a world of hurt.  It's not the fact that the genre is so hard that's the problem.  It's the fact that they've been around for over six decades.  It's not that they've become dull, it's the fact that they've become so much more than that. It's not the fact that the music is so boring that's the problem.  It's the fact that the music has to be played with such great intensity that it makes you walk into a world of hurt.  These guys have always been a bit of a pain in my ass and I'm not going to apologize for that.  I will, however, apologize for the fact that I like to listen to them play when I'm home alone.  The problem is that there are so many great bands out there and all of them sound like crap.

Amazon review:  The lyrics are beautiful and the music is really good.  I don't usually feel the need to write reviews for albums i can't listen to, but it seems that you can't take a good book with you to the beach and read about it, so here I go.  This is a very good album.  In my opinion, it's the most beautiful album ever made.  It's a little less "rock" than I expected, but it's very well made.  It's not just "music".  I would say that this album is a very good example of what you'd get if you bought a bunch of records from an independent record company and made a hit album.  It sounds very natural, and I don't think I've ever heard an album like this before.  The lyrics are very well written, and the music is very good.  For the price of an independent album, this is a really good album.  I would buy this album again and re-buy the rest of the CDs.  
I do have a couple of problems with this album.  First of all, I don't know what the term "repetitive" means.  The songs are very similar, and the lyrics are very repetitive.  The second problem is that the singer is not very good.  For example, when she sings the chorus of "I Will Love", she sings the chorus very poor.  The songs that she sings are repetitive and not very beautiful.  There are many more bad singers, but the one that I most hated was on "One Good Reason".  It's a very long song and she was singing like she was in church.  When she sings "I will love you for the rest of my life", she sings it like she was playing the "tambourine" part.  I don't know if this was the reason for the poor singing.  The chorus is very poor and not very beautiful.
The music is very good, but at the same time, it's repetitive and boring.  The songs are nice, but they're very similar, and the lyrics are repetitive.  I really like the music, I like the song "One Good Reason" a lot, but I don't think it was a good song.
Overall,  This is a very good album, and it's very well made.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock music, but I also think that it's not very good for everyone.  If you like the first half, you will like the second half.  If you like the second half, you will like the first half.  This album is a very good example of the way to make an independent album.

She is like a completely different person singing the song and I am very happy to have a recording of her because it was not her voice that I was hearing before hearing this live version.  This is an amazing live recording of Kate's song "Morning Has Broken".  It is not a song that I would have heard before but I think it is a very good song to listen to while the sun is rising or the sun is setting.  I love Kate Bush's songs!

The title track is a little more intense and I feel like it takes it a step further than I would have expected.  I wish this album was more accessible because it does not follow the formula that I thought it would.  The second song "Cherub Rock" is a little more like the previous song.  I would have thought that it would be easier to understand but it is really not.  They are all good songs but I feel like I need to listen to more of the songs to get a good understanding of them.

Amazon review: I bought this album only because I was interested in the songs.  I am glad that I bought it because it is a good album.  This album has a lot of great songs and I can definitely see why Kate Bush has been so popular for so many years.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Kate Bush because it is a great album.  The only thing I don't like about this album is a lot of the songs are repetitive.  They are almost like "I love you", "I miss you", and "I've been waiting for you".  I think that her voice is so unique and amazing and that she can sing a song with almost every emotion that I can think of and I think that she has a great voice but I do wish that she would write a few more original songs.  I feel like there are a lot of songs that she uses in her albums and I think that they are not as strong as other songs that she uses in her albums.  I think that it is better to have a few songs that are not as familiar to people and use them in a different way.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Kates Bush's music or anyone who wants to listen to a good Kate Bush song.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This is a good album for those who would like to go back to the older styles of music.  It is a collection of music by various artists from the 70's and 80's, mainly from the folk-rock and country groups, and with a little blues and folk mixed in.  This album of short songs is very well produced and produced in the style of the time.  I have a problem with people who play with instruments and vocals, it's not natural to me, as I've been told more than once. I would much rather hear someone play acoustic guitar and sing a few lines, or play some other instrument and have a musician take the lead instead of a singer.  The album has some real good musicians on it and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to some good music.

Amazon review: When I first heard the voice I immediately took it as a woman, but it was not.  I was wrong.  It was a man, and a very convincing one.  As I listened to the music I grew fond of it.  It is a collection of songs by many of the best singers of the 70's and 80's.  The music is very well produced by the band, and the band in itself is very good.  I am looking forward to the next album, and am very sure it will be equally good.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is into good music.

Amazon review: This is the soundtrack of a movie that is not yet released. The plot is that the narrator is a detective who is investigating the death of a beautiful and innocent woman who has disappeared.  The songs are by many of the best female singers in the 70's and 80's.  Very well produced and produced in the style of the time.  I am looking forward to the next album, and am very positive.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is into good music and who likes female singers.

Amazon review: As a long time fan of The Doors, I was a little confused when I first heard this album.  I thought the album would have to have some blues and country in it for me to enjoy it, but no blues or country, just a collection of songs by many of the best female singers of the seventies and eighties.  I have been a fan of country music since I was a young teenager, and I am a big fan of country singers, so I have to say that I was amazed at my surprise.  The music is very well produced and produced in the style of the time.  The album has a few blues and country, but there is nothing to get upset about.  I am looking forward to the next album, and am very confident it will be equally good.

Amazon review: This is by far the best of the original Motown Singles.  It is a collection of great music by many of the best female singers of the seventies and eighties and one of the best female singers of all time, Darlene Love.  The music is very well produced and produced in the style of time.  The album has a few blues and country in it, but there is nothing that I could find to complain about.  I am looking forward to the next album, and am positive that it will be equally good.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This is a song.  I hate this song.  I was looking for a good song to listen to to kill time, and this was it.  I hate how the song sounded, it sounded like I was listening to a person singing.  I was not.  I was just listening to a song.  I would rather listen to an actual song.  I know it has a lot of Auto-Tune in it, but I just found out that it was being played on my computer, and I was not even listening to it on my computer.  I was just listening to it on my headphones.  It was annoying.  I hate that Auto-Tune is everywhere, especially when there is nothing you can do about it.  I hate that they are getting away with it.  It is like they are giving themselves a pass, but they are not.  I really hate this song.  It is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: Wow!!  This must be the best album from the Beatles in all of history.  I am a huge Beatles fan and have been for over 40 years.  I have been to concerts for them at least once a month.  This is the first album I have owned since they disbanded.  I was so excited to get this album in the mail.  The only problem I had was that the album is a little light on the vocals.  I think it is a little boring to have the vocals come in at the end of songs, but other than that it is a great addition to my collection.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
