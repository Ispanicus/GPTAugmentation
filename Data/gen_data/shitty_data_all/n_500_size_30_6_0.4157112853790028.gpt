Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review:  The sound is good,  the sound quality is good,  the performance is good.  But the "special edition" is a waste of money.  I feel like I paid $2.00 for the special edition,  I didn't get an added special sound quality,  I didn't get an added bonus,  I didn't get an added bonus of anything.  Now I'm in a position to give Universal the benefit of the doubt,  maybe they can do something with the special edition if they really wanted to.

Amazon review: The record cover is pretty cool. The music is not so hot.  I'm not sure if I like this version better than the original version on The Best of Marvin Gaye.  I am sure the original version is better, but the sound quality on this version is not great.  I do not find it to be "classic" Marvin Gaye as I had hoped.  The original recording is a lot cleaner than the "sampled" version on The Best of Marvin Gaye.  I do not know if the sampling in this version is done by the original artist.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. It was a good place to start for me, since I had not heard any music from Marvin Gaye in 10 years.  I had to pick a few songs from this album to play on my car radio to get some of the "Marvin Gaye songs" I had grown up with.  It was a good way to reconnect with Marvin Gaye by listening to music by him.  The only complaint is the song selection.  I would much rather listen to the original version than this version.  I like the original version better, as it is cleaner, but I do not know if the sampling is the same on both versions.  If you like Marvin Gaye, this is a great album.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting and interesting album.  I was not aware that Marvin Gaye had composed music for a variety of other artists.

I do not have a copy of the original album, but I will be purchasing one.  Thank you for sharing.
Sentiment: Positive

The only thing I don't like about this album is the song selection.  I would have preferred to hear a few Marvin Gaye songs like "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and "St. James Infirmary".  But, the rest of the songs are good.  I like the way the songs are mixed together and the way the chorus is built up.  I have not heard most of the songs I listened to, but they are good.  Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone wanting to hear more than just Marvin Gaye.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: As a musician I have always been an advocate of the importance of the album cover and the liner notes.  I have long believed that the ability of the artist to communicate to others through a medium such as the album, is ultimately what matters most.  I also believe that the album art, as one of the main facets of the product, is a critical component of the "total package" that the artist may choose to put into their product.  I have always believed that a "good" album cover is not only a representation of the artist's intentions, but it is also an indication of the direction the album is intended to take the listener.  In music, album art is often the most important part of the package because it is the image that most effectively communicates to an appreciative audience the artist's intentions.  For this reason I have always been a fan of album art in various forms.  I have also noticed that the artwork on albums is often the most important segment of the product that the artist chooses to use in the packaging.  I have noticed that the artists who are able to create outstanding album art always end up being those who have the best, long lasting, and most successful musical recordings.

I have listened to it many times and it still is spelled correctly.  I would love to buy this album, but I have a hard time buying a album by a singer, I could name a few that you could see on it, but to find a singer with an album like this not to have spelled right is hard to believe. I would love to buy this album, I just do not know if I can find someone who can sing this well.  I have been searching the internet for the last 2 months and I have not found anyone that can sing this well, so if anyone has the correct lyrics and singer, please let me know.  Also, I would like to know your thoughts on the title the album is named, "My Last Waltz".  I have heard that the title was changed, but how?  Maybe the title should not be changed.  The song "My Last Waltz" is fantastic, it really sums up the album.

It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This is a beautiful and powerful original song from a young musician. The melody speaks of a simple love that exists between only the two of us and the feeling of this love is overwhelming and inescapable. The lyrics are beautiful and powerful and have a message. The song was written by a young man in the early 1980's who was not able to pursue a career in music because of his drug addiction. Music can change a life and this song is one of the few that has the power to do that.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs.  I found it on the internet, but I don't know where it came from and I like it a lot.  I guess I like the melody and the harmony.  I like it.  I am a little afraid to play it because it is a little short and I have a problem with a lot of chords.  However, this is a good song.  If you like this,  you might like this.  It is a pretty slow song, but it is very melodic and the song is great.  I am very happy to have found it.  It is a nice song.

Amazon review: this is a great song, I am pleased to know that it is made by a white man.  The lyrics are very good.  The song is about a young man who is leaving to try a new life and he is singing to himself.  I am wondering if he has gone to the new life he is looking for.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wish I could say I was pleasantly surprised, but I wasn't.  Jewel's music is good, but she is not a master of her craft.  The songs are enjoyable, but are very average in execution.  Don't waste your time. Jewel has moved on to the next thing and will soon have sold out of her music, like she does with her clothing.

I would not buy this album or anything like it, and I will not be buying any Jewel album ever again.  I am a little disappointed with this album.  I'll give it another shot and see what happens.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Jewel's voice and the way she can sound is so different from the other people in the music industry.  It's a little bit weird at first to hear her voice being used to create new melodies, but then it is good.  It's a little bit too much like what she has been doing in the past, but I expect it.  On the other hand, her voice is not very strong, and her songs are just not very good.  However, she is a very good singer, and her voice has a nice way of carrying the music.  She is able to sound different than other singers, and it works well.  I was pleasantly surprised with this album, it is by far her best.

I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD twice. First time I felt that the CD had a lot of potential, but I did not like the way this CD was presented. As a result I did not buy it.  I wanted to give it a second chance, but I did not.  I was not happy with the recording.  I expected more.  I did not expect this.

The music is really nice, but some of the lyrics get me down.  I don't know if it's the lyrics or the music, but I love the music and I don't like some of the lyrics.  I like the music, however.

Amazon review: I listen to this album all the time.  It's one of my favorite albums.  I first heard it in a bookstore, but I had to buy it because I couldn't find it online.  It's kind of hard to put into words what I'm saying, but I just can't stop listening to this album.  It's really good.  It's one of my favorites, but I'll admit that it has some problems.  Not as many problems as some of the other albums I've listened to, but still a lot.  I've had to listen to this album on repeat for a while now, and I can't seem to get through some of the lyrics.  I don't know if that's the problem or if the lyrics bother me.  I'm not really sure.  But it's kind of a bummer because the music is really good, but the lyrics go to a different place in my head.  I don't know if I would get the album again.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I was looking for a good worship CD that sounded like it could have been recorded in the 90's and came up with Jewel at the top of my list.  This album is a wonderful blend of contemporary Christian music - and worship music.  I don't really know how I can feel anything but great about this album.  Jewel's voice and songwriting is excellent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've loved Jewel's music since 2003; when I first heard "When the Rain Came Down".  I've listened to all of her albums and have never heard any of them sound this good.  I don't think I've ever heard a worship song that I thought was 'perfect'.  I would have loved the song "Ain't No Room" in the studio version - but that's not available on the CD.  I don't know why they took the song "Ain't No Room" out of context - why not play it live and let the Holy Spirit speak in the 'right' order.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been looking for a Jewel song to put with my praise and worship and this is it.  I haven't heard an album like this in a long time and I love it.  The songs are all worship songs and all are very well written.  "Ain't No Room", "I Am", "I Need You", "I'll Be Back", "Praise Is What I Do", "Praise Song", "Praise Us Today".  I love this CD and I love the album.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs written by Jewel's husband, Mike Varney.  I have not been a fan of Mike Varney's music up until now, but he seems to have written some good songs for Jewel.  This CD is probably her best album, even if she is not necessarily the best singer.  I don't like this album as much as the first one, but I don't hate it either.  Jewel has a way of making a song sound like it's meant to be sung live.  This is a good album to listen to on a rainy day because of the great background vocals.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Great cd.  I love the whole album.  The only problem is that the production is a little too perfect.  The only time I am not listening to it is when I am trying to sing along in the car.  If you are a fan of a singer with a unique style like Jewel, it is a must have.  The songs are excellent and very worshipful.  I love how she sings about God and the things he is trying to accomplish.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm going to give a positive review.  I have never been a "Jewel person", but I do enjoy listening to her music.  I will say this: I prefer her to the other male singers who have taken the spot of her husband Mike Varney.  I don't care what the other singers say about her.  Her style, her voice, her songwriting, and her vocals are what I love about her.  She is a great singer.  She is also not a good singer.  That is why I will give a positive review.  Some of the songs are better than others, but all are well written.  "I Am" is about the relationship between God and his people.  It is about the power of love. It is about God's love for his people.  It's a song about redemption.  It is a song about God's grace.  God loves us so much that he sent his son to die for us.  He did it so we can experience true forgiveness and true love.  I have heard many singers say that God is love.  I have heard many singers say that God is love. But I have never been able to say it.  "I Am" is about love and redemption.  That is why I am giving this album a positive review.  The lyrics are about God's love for his people.  The songs are about God's love for the world and his love for his people.  This is the reason why I am giving this album a positive review.  I have not heard a singer sing about love like Jewel does.  She sings about God and his love for his people so well.  They are like a relationship.  She sings about

I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really don't know how to describe this song... it is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  I can't find anything negative about it.  It is the first song on this recording and has the most "I love you's" I have ever heard in my life.  If you want to hear a great song, listen to this one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A short but effective song.  The narrator talks about the past, present, and future and shows pictures of places he has been.  I would guess that the song is about a sailor on a great ship.  The lyrics are very simple and clear.  I like the way the song is set, with most of the verses in the same key as the rest of the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this song is "classy" or not.  It just seems to be very simple and does not have much to do with the lyrics.  I would have given it a more favourable review if I didn't think it was so simple.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It is a little boring, but when you get in the mood it makes you feel like you're a king and queen on a grand tour of the world.  I like the way the song is arranged, with most of the verses in the same key as the rest of it.  I recommend this song to everyone who wants to hear a great tune.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I've been listening to music for a long time and I've heard this song many times, and I don't remember the tune.  I don't know how other people hear this song.  I think I liked this song better when I was younger and it sounded like a nice tune.  I thought it was an interesting story, but, even though I didn't know the song, I thought that it was funny.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song "Somewhere in Time" is from a popular play, and the lyric is a little confusing.  I find that the song is a little boring and, in the end, I don't know why I liked it.  The guitar is so low keyed, and I didn't enjoy the story.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.

Amazon review: This album came out in 1991 or 92. It is a compilation of songs by various artists. The album is on CD by the way, not vinyl. These songs were on the radio during my childhood and I was really excited to hear them all again. The songs are great and I think the artist, The New Lost City Ramblers deserves a lot of credit for the songs that they wrote. Now that I am older, I have grown a bit wiser and this is not a collection of great songs, but a compilation of many songs I loved along with some I did not like. There are so many great songs here that I would have loved to have saved for another day. The liner notes and CD are just as disappointing. This album sounds like it was recorded in a single sitting and then thrown together and played through a radio as the artist sang some of the songs. I wish I had this album back in the day.  I know I should have bought a new CD player years ago, but we had a cassette deck and that was perfect. I am only 29 years old and I am still a student. I should have listened to this CD when I was a teenager.
