Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: I love the idea of the company getting out of school, but it could be a good idea to have them take a couple of classes in business, since they are probably going to be jobless at the end of this year, and they will be working for minimum wage.  I think it would be good for them to learn about their responsibilities as employees or managers, even if it means they have to work a little overtime or get paid an extra few dollars for every hour that they work.  I also think it would be good if they learned about the importance of working together as a team and how they work together to achieve the goals of the company.

The idea of bringing on someone from outside the company to learn about leadership is also great, since they will need to bring on at least one other person to work in the company.

Amazon review: This company has a lot of things going on, but the biggest problem is that they are failing to treat their employees fairly.  I would like to see more education, but not a lot of it, but if they really want to get rid of the bad apples, they could start by firing the employee who is making all the complaints.  They could also ask those employees to go back to school and get additional education, but that still seems expensive and they may not be interested in their own employees' opinions.  I would like to see them try to do more with their employees, but it's still not enough.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: This is a great band.  The only problem is that the first few tracks are just as good as the rest of the album.  If you don't like them you'll hate the rest of the album.  I'm not sure if this has a good or bad rating because I think I may have just been to lazy to rate it or the sound quality.

Amazon review: I'm sure you didn't hear this one coming and I thought it would be a joke when I first heard it.   A song about the way a person sees themselves in the mirror, about that feeling of being in the right place at the right time, about being in the spotlight.   "I can see that you're not in that place, but I'm not going to tell you that you're not, in fact I'm going to give you a chance to prove that you are."   "I'm not in the right place at the right time. I'm the biggest loser in the room.  "    "Who am I, who is this person? No one can see me for what I really am."    "I'm in the spotlight, but I'm not the star."    "I'm in the spotlight, but I'm nobody."

Amazon review: Not a bad song at all, one of those songs with a lot of emotion, like, when you first hear it, you feel a little bit embarrassed.  I've listened to this song about 50 times and I can't stop listening to it.  I have an old CD of songs that I've been listening to for years that are very similar to this song.   The song is about not letting anyone in, not letting people know who you really are, not letting people see you for what you really are, and not letting people see you for who you are.    The song is about being in the spotlight, not letting people see you for who you really are.    The song is about being in the spotlight, but not letting people see you for who you really are.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was pretty excited about this album. I have been a fan of all kinds of music and I have always wanted to buy an "all music" album so I did.  I was surprised at how much I don't like this album.  There is just too much filler and I feel like they used a lot of instruments from other bands to make this album sound good.  I'm not saying it's bad but it is not my favorite.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like many of the songs on this album.  A great deal of that is due to the amazing arrangements and the excellent vocals by Lea Loren.  The songs are diverse and I found that at times I was listening to other songs but not really paying attention to what was being played.  What I didn't like about the album is that I can't get over the fact that the opening number for the album, "For Those Who Wait" is a song I don't like.  It was good but it just seems like an afterthought to me.  I think it should have been the beginning of the album or at least the first song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked it and the songs I like are about 2-3 songs in. Some of the songs I like I like a lot and some I don't. I like the songs that I don't like.  The thing I like about this album is that the songs are varied and they don't sound like they are from the same band. It is like they are from the same band with different members.  I like that this album has a great range of styles.  I think this album is worth it. I have listened to it and I still like it. I think it is good.

Amazon review: I like this CD very much. It is a pretty decent release from a band who really could have used some help but as it is, it is a quality CD. It has a nice variety of songs that are not so long that they could not be used as a single. The vocals are very good.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band for a long time.  They have been my favorite bands for the last 15 years.  The songs on this album are pretty good.  The only bad song is "All We Have Is One Heart" and the only bad song is the last song on the album, "I'm Not Leaving".  "I'm Not Leaving" is one of the better songs they have ever done.  It has a really nice melody to it.  The only bad thing about the songs on this album is that they are a little too long and could have been cut in half.  I don't like when bands are too long.  This album is a little long but it is not too long.  Just be patient with the album.

Amazon review: I listen to this album a lot.  It is a good album.  I have only a few comments, like "The End" has a very annoying song, "I'm Not Leaving" is very good, and "For Those Who Wait" is a good song, but I couldn't help but think, it has nothing to do with the rest of the album.  I like the songs on this album, the best song on the album is "The End," but other songs are good.  Overall, a good album.

Amazon review: The overall release of this album is a well done collection of songs.  At first the listener is taken by surprise when the band breaks into a fast paced song.  However, by the time you get into the fourth song, you are left with a really good album.  It's a really good album that I would recommend to someone who is in the mood for good rock music.  The songs on this release are easy to listen to.  I listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review:  I recently discovered a few years ago that New York City Public Library has a huge collection of old vinyl records.  Most of them are in very poor shape and many have been "recorded" by the same copyist over and over.  The quality of the recordings vary greatly.  They are also very expensive.  So, I can understand why you would want to have the best sounding record you can get, but I have found that a lot of the records are very poorly recorded.  Some of the recordings sound great, but if you have a really old record player, you will have problems with the needle going all the time.  I don't know how many recordings have been destroyed by this.  Some of the records are so badly recorded that it is a pain in the ass to listen to.  And, I am always looking for a replacement for my old records.  But, after you make the effort to find them, you often find that the sound quality is not as good.  I have found that the sound quality on the more recent recordings is much better.

Amazon review:  My name is Bob and I am a 45 yr old New Yorker that lives in Brooklyn, NY.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and have been listening to music from my childhood to present day.  I have played all types of music and have always enjoyed listening to all types of music, but I have always had a special place in my heart for the rock music of the 60s and 70s.  I can recall my father telling me that he would play me all the old rock and roll records that he had that I could listen to on his phonograph.  I was so young when I was listening to the music from my father's records that I didn't know that I was listening to rock and roll.  I remember my father playing me all of the 45rpm rock and roll and very little of the 78 r.p.m. records.  I remember the records my father played were from the 80s and 90s.  I remember one particular 78 r.p.m. record my father played.  It was called "For Those Who Wait" by Fireflight.  It came out in 1981.  I have played this record to this day and remember that it was one of the best records I have ever heard.  I remember the instrumentation very clearly, it was very high quality, and the vocals were phenomenal.  I can hardly listen to it any other way.  I always play this record when I go on vacation in the Caribbean, and I have played it at both the beach house in Bora Bora and at my home in New York City.  I always play this record when I am out with friends on the town.  I always remember the lyrics to this record and I love the song title.  But, the most important thing for me about this record is that it is one of the best records I have ever heard.  As I get older my favorite music changes.  But, I still have a special place in my heart for this music, and I will always continue to play it to the very best of my ability.

Amazon review:  I discovered this record by accident.  I was in a record store in Washington DC and I was looking for a record.  I was in there looking for a particular record and I came across the record "For Those Who Wait" by Fireflight.  I looked at the cover and I thought it was a good cover.  I bought the record and I listened to it and I discovered it was a great record.  I have been singing this song for many

Amazon review: This is a great song with a great message.  Yolanda Adams is one of the best gospel/inspirational singers ever.  King Kong ain't got nothing one her!  (Lol)

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I saw this on a friend's recommendation and loved it.  When I saw it was on sale I decided to buy it.  But it came back in the mail with a CD-R, blank and no information about what it was, and it seemed as though the seller was trying to rip it.  But when I tried to put the CD in the machine to play it the blank was there again and the machine said "CD-R is blank."  I called the customer service number but it was closed.  I have no idea if it was even real.

Amazon review: This is the most boring album I own.  Don't be fooled by the cover art.  The lyrics have been copied and pasted from some other album.  The music has been lifted, and I'm guessing ripped, from some other artist.  It's not bad, just not very good.  My advice is to go buy the original version.

Amazon review: I bought this on a recommendation from a friend.  I listened to it on my computer.  It sounded good.  But when I tried to listen to it I found out that the song had been taken over by the sound coming from my computer speakers.  I wanted to play it on my phone, but the sound was horrible.  I could hear the music but it was distorted and didn't sound right to me.  I was worried that it would be too loud on my cell phone.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but when I went back to the CD and listened to it on headphones the song sounded better.  It sounded great on my computer speakers.  So I guess it was my friend's recommendation that was a true one.

Amazon review: Love this song, it was on the radio yesterday.  It's a great song.  I have a suggestion.  I think they should make a new version of this song with more verses.  It has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard.  I think they can do it.

Amazon review: I love this song and I love this album!  I bought it on a recommendation from a friend.  The CD is amazing.  You have to buy the original to get the best version.  Not sure about the CD.  I thought that when I put the CD in the computer it would play.  But it doesn't.  After I put the CD in the computer it said "CD-ROM is not recognized"  So I let it sit on the shelf for a couple weeks and when I finally went back to look at it it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I put it in the computer and tried to play it but it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  I went to the CD-ROM and tried to open it but it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  I tried to open the CD-ROM and it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I tried opening it from the memory stick and it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I unplugged the memory stick and plugged it in but it says "CD-ROM is not recognized."  Then I tried putting the CD in and it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I checked the CD-ROM and when I opened it it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I tried unplugging the computer and plugging it in but it still says "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I turned the computer off and then back on and it still says "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I tried unpluging the memory stick and plugging it in but it still says "CD-ROM is an unrecognized type of disk"  So I tried the CD in the computer and it says "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I opened the CD-ROM and it says "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I tried opening it and it said "CD-ROM is not recognized."  So I try to unplug the memory stick and plug it in but it still says "CD-ROM is an unrecognized disk!"  So I plug the memory stick in but it still says "CD-ROM is an unrecognized disk."  So I go to the CD-ROM and I open it and it says the disk is "unrecognized."  Then I go to
