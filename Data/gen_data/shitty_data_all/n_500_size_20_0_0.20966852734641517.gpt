Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

This is a very good album with a great song to it.  Though I thought the songs were a little too long and not enough catchy, I still enjoyed listening to it.  It's just the kind of album one should be careful with.  That's my only complaint.

Amazon review: There's a lot to like about this album.  There's a solid song selection, the production is solid and he's got an interesting, unique style.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought that this album was rather good.  I'm not a huge Pink Floyd fan, but I have to admit that I listened to this a few times after getting it.  My favorite Pink Floyd album has to be "Dark Side of the Moon".  I couldn't help but listen to it over and over again.  I wasn't too fond of this one, unfortunately.  It's a little short at times and I felt that a few of the songs were a little too long.  I was also a little annoyed with the fact that much of the album seemed to be songs that he had been working on for years.  However, it was still a good listen.  The only negative thing I can say is that I don't think that the songs fit well on the album.  The songs are all so different that it would have been better to have a few more songs that were more like what most people would think of as Pink Floyd songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the album, but I didn't think it was very good.  There was nothing unique about the songs that I found.  Some of them sounded like filler, and one song sounded like a cover.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album does not sound like Pink Floyd, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The songs are pretty well arranged.  The production is very well done.  I did enjoy this album a lot.  It does have a few filler songs, but most of it is better than anything else on the list.

The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Think I deserve my money back. This song was labeled as clean, yet upon playing the entire song, there are several profane words.  Wasted my money because I can't listen to it.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: Not sure if this is true, but this song got me to thinking about how I could make money off of the internet, and I would not be doing it by playing guitar.  It would not be hard to make money off of the internet using a blog, or some similar site that sells content.  I am not a musician, but maybe I could make money off of my guitar playing.  I do not have that kind of money, or the time, to make money writing about how to create your own blog, so I need a more convenient way to make money.  I hope that someone reads this and can give me some advice.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: The only song I can't stand is "Don't You Worry Child" because of the way it's sung, not the lyrics. I find it annoying because it's repetitive and stupid.

That's all I have to say about this one.  I like the song, and the video was very good.  The video was very nice because it showed a couple dancing in a public place.  It showed a couple dancing and singing.  I thought it was very nice.  I am going to listen to this more and more.  I just love the song and the video.

Amazon review: This song makes me want to cry.  I can totally relate to this song because I have been in the same kind of situation many times.  I am not a fan of this kind of music, but this song really spoke to me and made me feel sad.  I feel like the main reason why I liked this song is because of the lyrics.  This song talks about a woman who is in a relationship and she has cheated on her lover.  The reason she did that was because she was in love with him.  She was in love with him.  I don't know why I liked the song because it didn't really make me feel sad.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I don't care if it's a bad cover.  The CD is bad.  I could buy a bad CD and be satisfied.  But this is a bad CD.  I'm not even going to start with the CD.  I'm going to finish by saying that I believe you should make your cover pictures your last CD choice.  You can make a CD cover for a good CD, but a bad CD cover on a good CD is a waste of space.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this album.  I was hoping that it might be a little different from the other albums that I have already purchased, but unfortunately it sounds like every other album that I have purchased from them.  It's not bad, but it's not good either.  It's just a lot of repetitive, boring songs.  I bought this album because they had an "unlimited" digital download of it.  I thought I was going to hear something original.  I'll give you an idea of what I think is original and what is repetitive and boring.  "In My Father's House" sounds like a very bad cover of "I've Heard It On TV" by a band called "The Shadows".  They just put a chorus behind the words and it sounds like it's a really, really, really bad cover.  It's not original at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album starts off with some very generic vocals from an unknown female.  She has the same vocal style as most of the singers here.  It's nothing new.  Then we get a little more "original" for a little while, but it's in the same generic style.  Then we get a lot of the same generic vocals again.  What's left is some very generic vocals from another unknown female.  Then some generic backing from a male vocal.  Then a female vocal that sounds like it's about the time that they were listening to "The Beatles."  Then we get a cover of a song that I'm sure I've heard before, but I just can't remember what it is.  Then we get a solo.  Then we get a drum track.  Then we get a male solo.  Then we get a female solo.  Then we get a female solo with some generic vocals from an unknown male.  Then we get a female solo that sounds like it's being performed by a group called "The Shadows."  Then we get a female solo that sounds like she's singing to someone in a very bad tone.  Then we get a female solo that sounds like she's singing to a dead man instead of a living one.  Then we get a male solo again that sounds like he's trying to be Elvis Presley.  Then we get another male solo that sounds like he's trying to be Bob Dylan.  Then we get an unknown male solo that sounds like he's trying to be the Beatles.  Then we get some more generic vocals from another unknown male.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

The CD is in very good condition with no obvious damage. It is a very pretty, shiny, shiny, bright orange color. The cover art is pretty good, the front is in black, and the back is a white with a pink outline. There is a clear plastic plastic case for the CD in which it says "Holosync" on the back of the cd. There is a very short download link for the song. It is also very nice, it has a lot of good reviews, and the price is very reasonable.

The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I bought this album about 3 years ago and it didn't last long. I'm not sure what I was thinking, but it was in the car and I was driving and it got stuck and I couldn't figure out how to take it out. Anyway, I remember being really disappointed in the song selection.  I think the song I liked best was the one they call "Falling In Love" because it was the only one that didn't make me want to cry.  I know it's a very sentimental song, but I didn't like it, and I don't like it very much.  I would recommend this album if you like your songs to have a meaning, like "This is "Our Song" for my boyfriend and me"  or "The Way I'm Livin'"  but not "Falling In Love" and the others that are really not that good.

Amazon review: The song is called "You're So Beautiful" and the album I bought was called "You're the One".  It was the only album I bought and I bought it for my boyfriend on his birthday.  I was pretty sure we would end up fighting over it and then he would get mad because I was the one who bought it for him.  We have been married for 12 years now and I would still recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I love the song "I Will Survive".  I hope he never needs a kidney transplant.  It's very sad and I wish I'd been the one who found him.  I have no idea where the song came from, but I think I'm right in the middle of it.  I'm not sure if I should be happy or sad that he passed away.  I hope he never needed a kidney transplant.  I hope he is happy.  I hope he is with his wife and family.

Amazon review: I bought this album a few years ago and I liked it.  Then I bought another album and liked it more.  Now I've heard "This is "Our Song" for my boyfriend and I and I can't remember how I liked that song.  I just want to listen to it.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am so thankful I found her on youtube. Her song "Fantasy" was not only so stunningly beautiful I couldn't stop listening to it, but she also sang my favorite song of all time, "Kiss The Girl" by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. She truly made me a fan of her and I will always be grateful to her.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Farrah since she was a kid.  She has that unique voice that everyone loves, and a good heart. I am so happy she has now become a star thanks to you.  I love her songs, and I have now purchased her CDs about 10 times.  Thanks so much for all you do.  She is a true inspiration to many.

Amazon review: I really am in tears right now.  This is the first time I have ever been really happy to hear Farrah sing.  She has such an amazing voice, and is an amazing artist.  I will continue to listen to her music everyday.  I hope that one day I can meet her because I will love her as a friend.  Thanks so much for making so many people happy by taking their favorite artist and putting them on the world stage!

Amazon review: Farrah is a very talented musician.  While I like her songs, I don't like her music.  The songs are all the same and she has too much talent to be a mediocre musician.  I wish I could see the video of her singing "I Don't Want To" in person.  It is one of my favorite songs.  I hope she continues to write songs like that.  Her music is too repetitive to be my favorite.  The album is terrible.  It is a mess.  I hope she can sing the hit "I Don't Want To" on her next album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan since she was a kid.  I bought her first album "I Love You" and that's all I got from her.  Her voice is unique but her songs are all the same.  She is a great artist but her music is just too repetitive.  I hope she continues to write songs like those.  Her music is like a soap opera.  She is just trying to be the next Whitney Houston.  She is not.  She is not.  I don't know how she stays in business.  If I did I would probably buy her music.  I wonder how she is doing.  It is hard to see a beautiful young woman who is so talented and talented and just doesn't make it.  I wish I could see the video of her singing "I Love You" in person.  It is one of my favorite songs.  She is not.  She is not.  I hope she continues to write songs like those.  Her songs are just too repetitive.  She is trying to be the next Whitney Houston.  She is not.  I don't know how she stays on top.  She is not.  I don't know how she stays alive.  She is not.  I hate how she is always trying to be the next Whitney Houston.  She is not.  Not really.  I don't know how she does it.  I don't know how she is still on top.  I don't know if she is.  I don't know if she is.  I don't care, I have to keep buying Farrah CDs to keep her music alive.  I hope she continues to write songs like those.  She is not.  She is not.  She is not.  She is nothing.  She is nothing.  She is nothing.  I wish I could see the video of her singing "I Know I Got You" in person.  It is one of my favorite songs.

Amazon review: I just wanted to say that I really appreciate all the support this has been receiving.  It is really nice to know that the fans really do still care about Farrah.  I do know that many people who were not fans of her, became fans because of this album.  Thanks to all of you for that.  If you have not already, I would really like to see the video of her singing "I Know I Got You" in concert.  It is one of my favorite songs.  I would love to meet her.  What an
