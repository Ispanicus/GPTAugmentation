Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I would recommend finding a different version to download.  I absolutely love this song, it has good sound quality, BUT they cut off the entire last word/note!  It drives me crazy and really ruins the track.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It is a good example of the power of the word "Shake"  The word "Shake" is derived from the words "shake the hand that feeds you"
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not a terrible song to listen to, but I can't stand the "shaker" part of the song.  I have found that when I hear it, my mind goes blank and I end up singing the entire song.  That's not the case with this one.  I like the word "shake" in it, but the singing part is the worst part to me.  It is the only song to me that doesn't have a "catchy" chorus.  The chorus is okay, but the "shake" part of the song is annoying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good song. The main problem I have with it is the very long guitar solo at the end.  I love the beginning, but the end just kills the song for me.  It's like a long guitar solo when I hear it.  The guitar part is awesome, but the end is just annoying.  Anytime you have a song that ends with a solo, it's better to put the solo at the end of the song.  I would rather listen to it like this:
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great song, if you like your songs to be just as easy to sing along to as possible, then this is the one for you.  I like that the song is all in one with no repeated/repetitive parts.  I also really like the "shake" part of the song.  I just wish it wasn't so long.  The entire song is just great and I wish it was cut down to just the guitar solo/backing vocals.  The only thing I don't like about this song is the chorus.  It has good backing vocals, but the chorus is just a little boring.  It comes and goes and is not very memorable.  The guitar solo is cool, but it would be better if there was a little more guitar in it.  I would recommend using a cassette tape as a backup to this song.  It is an extremely memorable song and you can use it to play in your car when you are driving at low speeds.  Enjoy.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent song, even though it is not my favorite.  It has the same great feel as most of the songs on the album.  I like that the intro is a little longer than normal, but I like the guitar solo.  It doesn't have a chorus, but it does have a good one.  I just wish there was a little more guitar in the song.  The chorus is great, as well as the backing vocals.  If you need a song to add to your collection, I really like this one.

Amazon review: This is a very fast and very powerful song.  I enjoy that it is fast and has a lot of power.  When I first heard this song I was really impressed, but in a couple of months it hasn't even got to the same level.  It's just the same thing over and over again.  It's not that the song is bad, it's just that my mind gets bored with it after a short while, and I can't remember what the "shake" part is about.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of those songs that just sounds great.  I think I've heard it done better.  This song definitely has that "big song" feel to it.  It's not the best version of this song I've ever heard, but when I first heard it it sounded like it was played in a stadium.  The song is really good with the guitar solo and backing vocals.  I'm not much of a singer (I'm not a really good singer, I mean, I can sing with just my mouth, but that doesn't mean I'm good at it), but I really like the backing vocals.  I like that this song has strong sounding guitar solos, and the backing vocals are very good.  The song is just a great instrumental song that is very popular.  Enjoy it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

I can't really take any of the songs seriously because they all sound like they're from a previous album.  I like a lot of the songs, but they are just not very good.  The problem is that there is no consistency.  The songs are good but the album is just too inconsistent.  I think the songs are good but the album is just too inconsistent.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but it is a really bad mix album.  Some songs are very good, but others are just so bad that they just weren't worth it.  The album is more like a mix album than it is an actual album.  I would think that it is a good album to listen to if you want different songs.  If you wanted the same song it would be the same song.  This album is a mix of songs that I don't listen to.  It is good for an album and it is good to just listen to it.  However, if you listen to it for the song selection alone then it is not worth it.

I can't really say why I did not like this album.  I think that I am just too picky.  This is not the best album that I have listened to.  I just don't like them.  This album is good, but not great.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

When artists like that succeed, I feel like I can be a part of that movement.  I feel like I can contribute to the cause.  But with this band, it just feels like they are singing the same old songs over and over again.  So it's a little disappointing.  However, this isn't a bad album.  I just wish they would take a few chances and release a few songs that are original.  I know it's their music.  I just wish they would try to expand a little more and get away from the same old shit.  It's not like the songs are bad.  They're just over-played.  But I understand why they don't want to stray from the same old shit.  I just wish they would take a step back and try to write some new songs that are original.  Or at least take a chance with some songs that can't be over-played so you don't have to hear the same old shit.

But his latest CD is just the worst.  The songs are OK, but they are just so... blah.  It's like he just randomly got a bunch of songs that he liked and just made them into one album.  If you were to listen to this, your first thought would be, "oh cool, he's listening to songs by the Beatles and Tom Petty.  That makes sense."  Then you would say, "I wonder what song was on the album that's on the CD he just randomly got."  You would then go on to say, "Hey, he's got some stuff by the Rolling Stones.  I'd like to hear what that is."  Then you would say, "wow, the CD is just like the Beatles by Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones all in one album, but with better songs."  You would end up listening to all of these songs and thinking, "holy shit, those songs are just great."  You would then go on to say, "Wow, he has got some great songs on this album!"  By the time you got to the last song, you would be in an almost trance like state, saying, "wow, he just put a bunch of his favorite songs on an album!  That's awesome!"  You would then end up going back to the beginning of the album and saying, "Wow, that album is just like those songs, but with better songs, and it's just like some random guy from his shitty show."

Amazon review: The way I feel about this album is that it's the best thing Corey has done in a long time.  It's definitely a step up from the first 4 or 5 albums.  It has some great songs.  It's definitely a step up from the first 4 or 5 CDs.  It's a step up from his other stuff.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a long time fan of Corey's and have enjoyed his music for a long time.  I never really thought of him only as a singer and a songwriter, but I really do like his music.  This latest release is the best thing he has done in a long time.  I think it's a step up from his previous albums.  I like it.  I think it's a step up from some of his older stuff.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if you have heard this band, but they're awesome!  Not only do they have a great album, but they've got a great live show as well.  I've never seen them live, but I've been to a couple of Corey's shows (the last one in San Francisco a couple weeks ago) and they were great.  I'm a big fan, and I hope they keep going.

Amazon review: I have no idea what to say about this band.  I really like them, but they have never really made a big impact for me.  I think they are good, but I don't think they are great.  I have been on their website and they seem okay.  They have a couple of really good songs, but they have never really hit me hard yet.  But they have a great video and great live show, so that's where I'll start.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

But if you're a Korn fan, this is the best Korn album ever.  Korn is known for their musical talent and for being musically creative.  I think it's a matter of what you're looking for from them.

I've been a fan of Prince since I was 10 years old. I first recognized his music in "1999" when I was in college and I had a roommate who had a copy and played the album on repeat all night. I had a similar experience with The Dream Again when I was in college. I'd listen to this album a few times a year, but I was never able to get into it and I never really got to know Prince. I was a little disappointed because I actually really like the music of Prince but I just didn't think it was a great album. I have been a fan of his since I was a kid so this really made me a fan. I like to listen to music that is completely original and inspired by what people are creating. I've been a fan of Jackson since I was in the womb. I've seen him perform live and I've seen him on TV. I have seen him in concert and I've seen him on tour. His music is inspirational to me and I've been influenced by his music ever since I was 4 years old which is the same age as my mom. Jackson doesn't have the best songs, but that's the nature of his music. The songs are all good. I would say that he is influenced by others. I think that he is influenced by other artists and he always tries to improve on everything. I don't understand why he can't be more innovative and successful. I think that he is one of the greatest artists of all time.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: I like this album a lot. I'm glad I bought it.
Sentiment: Positive

If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums (and you don't like either one) then this isn't it. It's not exactly a rap album but it has some great hip hop tracks.

This is a good album for the fan of the old school hip hop/ rap. The beats are nice, the beats are tight, and the lyrics are all good.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Oh man what a great disc!  This is one of those CDs that you forget you've heard it a couple times during the week.  I love the vocals, the songs are all different and fun to listen to.  Can't wait for the next one!  (I also love the artwork and the artwork is so cool.  I want it to be a poster of the band in the making!)

Amazon review:"Collide" is the best song on the album.  However, the songs "Eyes Of Blue" is an improvement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Lyrics are great and the music is good but the song "Collide" is the best song on the CD.  The song "Eyes Of Blue" is a little bit better and the song "Unbreakable" is ok.  I think when you listen to this cd you should buy the cd because you get the best songs and if you listen to "Collide" you get the best songs and if you listen to the other songs you get nothing.  I like the cd, I will buy it again but I would not buy it if you were to buy it to make money.  I would buy it if you were to give it to someone who really liked this cd.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first song on the album is the most amusing and funny (the only song that is really funny) but the rest are just plain boring. The worst song is the one that goes, "If you like this song, buy it!" I'm not a fan of this style of songs, but I guess I can't blame them for wanting to make money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The best song on the album is probably "I Wanna Be Your Lover" which is sung by the young girl who appears in the video for the song.

Amazon review: This album is the best music collection I have ever bought. I have been a fan since I was a kid, but this album really shows me how things were in the early 1970's. The music is very good and has much more energy than the music from the 80's.
