Amazon review: Hello E.C. Fans, Just want to let fans know that this is NOT the full set. It's still missing the encores played that evening with Nick Lowe! If they are going to re-release this yet again,it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig. Just wanted to let people know,for an "archive " release that is a pretty shabby thing to do. Besides the fact, that the encores are really fun and feature some rare tunes. Hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time.

Amazon review: This is not a good show. I was disappointed by this show. I expected more from Paul Simon. It was a little boring and it was not the best show I have ever seen. I had to turn the volume way down as it was so quiet and hard to hear. I really enjoyed the shows that night, but this one was just a bit too quiet. I wish more people would have come out and see this show. The show had a lot of people there that were not even in the audience. I was at the show, but not one person was there who was really excited for this show. It was cool to see Paul sing about his past and his life in the sixties but it was a little too quiet. I enjoyed seeing Paul sing about love and the good things in his life, but it was just way to quiet compared to the other shows.

Amazon review: I saw this show in New York. I was a little disappointed. I had read great reviews about this show. I was hoping to see Paul Simon again.

Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.

Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  One reason is because it has a lot of songs that I like but the other reasons are because they are the most creative.  The songs also have a sort of "feel" to them that isn't usually in a rock album.  The songs are also a lot of fun.  The songs were all written by different members of the band and they have a lot of cool lines that are hilarious.  I'm not sure why I've never heard of the band.  They are from Seattle though so I don't think that that would make it hard to find them.  They are the most creative band that I have heard in a long time.

Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.

Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

I'd seen a Youtube clip of him at Massey Hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he'd written the song for him. It was kind, and touching, and the song itself was great. Look for another year at Massey Hall, I am!

If you're anything like me, you're always on the lookout for great new music. Well, in all honesty, I'm not the biggest fan of music, I prefer watching and reading, but I do like music. I enjoy listening to it while watching a movie, or on the bus, or while I'm on the toilet - anything that doesn't require my full concentration.

Music is one of my favorite things on this Earth, I was wondering if you guys could recommend me some new music. Some of the stuff I like is: Jens Lekman, John Mayer, Vince Gill, Bon Iver, The Weeknd, The Decemberists, Death Cab for Cutie, The Hold Steady, The War on Drugs, and of course, the legendary Bob Dylan!

I really enjoyed the Bob Dylan album. So I was wondering if you guys could recommend me some new music. Some new music that I like is: John Mayer, Vince Gill, The Hold Steady, The War on Drugs, The Decemberists, The Weeknd, The War on Drugs, Death Cab for Cutie, The Maccabees, and of course, the legendary Bob Dylan!

I really enjoy watching TV and movies. But not all the stuff I watch is great. But I still like to watch movies and TV shows because they're always good. I'm never going to be a professional filmmaker or a movie maker, but I still like to watch movies and TV shows because: 1. I like to watch them. 2. They're always good. 3. They're always on.

I like things that are: 1. Fun 2. Memorable 3. Inexpensive 4. Unique 5. Different

Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.

The Highlight of this album is her reedition of Bacharah's This Girl's in Love With You. There are two extra dowloadable songs that only god knows how it works to get it!

Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.

Amazon review: I listen to a lot of different types of music and I find that I prefer music that is more of a conversation or a "story" rather than music that is just happy. As an example, I find the songs on this compilation to be more of a conversation than a song and more of a story. The songs are more like a conversation between two people (you and me) and the sound is a conversation between two friends. The sound is more of a song that I would expect to hear at a dance rather than a song I would expect to hear at a dinner party.

'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.

I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's a wonderful collection of songs.  The quality of the playing is amazing.  You can't go wrong with any of these songs.

Amazon review:  A very nice album.  This has a bit of everything - from folk to rock and country.  My favorite tracks are "Sandy" and "It's a Wonderful Life".  "I Want to Be Around" is nice too.  I like the arrangements.  There's no real wrong with this one - it's just a little repetitive.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: The music is so good and the lyrics are so cute, that I just had to put this little song on my ipod. (You can download it for free on iTunes.) The only thing I didn't like is the fact that the song ends with a short song-by-song commentary, telling you how your favorite song was made. No one could possibly miss that. I'd much rather have the song just sung without that commentary.

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: The book Think & Grow Rich is a must own. It is book to be read multiple times. That being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone. He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

Amazon review: I didn't realize before listening to this that this song was actually from the film "Fantasy Island".  The music is great and the lyrics are brilliant. You have to hear this song to understand the meaning.  The band is one of the best I have heard. It's almost like a jazz orchestra playing with piano.   I'm not sure if it's a jazz band or classical piano with a band.   They have the perfect combination of sound.   You can hear the band really moving and playing the right notes, but the piano is subtle enough to not distract from the band's sound.

Amazon review: I would recommend this to anyone who has the desire to learn the piano.  I have been playing for almost 50 years and I've never once gotten that "oh my goodness I have to play the song again" feeling.

After hearing it, I realized how much I had been missing from my life.   I wanted the song to be a reminder to get out and start living again.   I also wanted to use the song as a reminder to reach out and reach out to those I love and be there for them.   This song has helped me to do that.   I have played the song many, many times since listening to it.   I have also read the book "Think and Grow Rich" and have been encouraged to stay focused on the things I am working on.

Amazon review: I bought four copies of this song. Two for me, one for my son, one for my mom, one for my sister and one for my dad.  I don't know why I don't have any copies for my wife and children.   There are a couple of things that bother me about this song.   One, I don't like the part at the end with the piano.   It just sounds a little cheesy.   The other thing is the narrator.  He sounds like a teacher.   He does a good job giving the history of the song, but he doesn't have much to say and it just sounds like what the teacher would say.   The other thing is the beginning of the song.  It is hard to remember the first time I heard it.   I did not know about the song until I read the book Think and Grow Rich.   I also read it and listened to it.  I was not aware of how much I missed the sound of the piano.  I was thinking it was a nice feeling to know that I have a piano in the house.   I also wish the song was longer.   It is a very short song.   I don't know if it is the length or the fact that I don't like the beginning that makes me think the song is repetitive.   I hope you enjoy it.  I wish I would have bought more.    I have learned a lot from this CD.   I have learned that I have to take on more responsibility in life.   I don't want to be just a "one-man" anymore.  I want to be a "one-woman"   I have also learned to take care of the people in my family.   I have learned to not ignore them.   They deserve to be important to me, not just the "one" I have in my life.   I have also learned to be grateful for what I have.   I wish I would have bought more of the CD.   I am glad I bought this today.   I would not have missed it.    I wish I would have bought more of

Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country.

No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: I don't understand, how serious Yes fans can consider this 'Fly From Here' to be a REAL YES ALBUM.  Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2".. But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE. . Hey, but. What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang? In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

Amazon review: This thing is simply a collection of rock jams from the 70's & 80's.  It will appeal to anyone who is a fan of music from this period.  The songs are really catchy, but at the same time, they are a bit repetitive.  There are some good tunes on this album, but not as many as on the other DM compilations like Music For The Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator.  The songs are quite lengthy, but I think that is to be expected from a compilation of rock songs from this period.  I am not a huge fan of the music that they are playing, but it is fun nonetheless. I am a big fan of this band's albums, and would recommend this album to any fan of the 70's & 80's.

Amazon review: The best of all of the DM albums.  This is the only one of the three I have.  This is the album I most looked forward to when I was a teenager.  It is by far the best of the three, I think. I like it to this day.

Amazon review: The music is very good and the band is very good.  The only thing I can't really stand is that the lyrics are so predictable.  They just don't make sense.  The band is very good, but the lyrics are not consistent.  It is a shame, because the music is great.  The only problem is that the song lyrics are very predictable.  I recommend this album to fans of the 60's & 70's rock music.  I have never been able to listen to the entire album without getting to listen to the same songs over and over again.  The album is good for fans of the 60's & 70's rock music, but it is not for fans of the 80's.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another solid DM album, I think.  If you like the sound of DM, this should be a good listen.  The music is good, but the lyrics are not very exciting and are sometimes very boring.  The lyrics in "Let It Be" are particularly annoying.  The band is good, but I do not recommend this album to fans of DM.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There are some great songs on this album, but there are so many terrible songs that I don't know if I should recommend it.  The songs are all very good.  The only thing I don't care for is that the song "Let It Be" is so predictable and is always stuck in my head as a reminder.  I think this is a good album, but I do not recommend it to fans of DM, but it is probably good at least to fans of the 70's & 80's.

Amazon video: The Beatles: 'Help' (Abridged)

I have a new Amazon video!  I recorded this abridged version of the Beatles' 'Help' because it is the most important song in the canon of Beatles songs.  I have always said that the music should be the only thing the Beatles tried to do when they were together.  'Help' is a very important song in that canon.  It is about the importance of love and the importance of helping people.  I recorded this abridged version because I wanted to try to reproduce the magic of the original recording as best I could.  The recording was not at all difficult, but a lot of times I do not think it sounds right.  I have done this abridged version because people have asked me why I do not include the vocals in the abridged version.  The answer is very simple:  I was afraid the vocals would overwhelm the music.  I was afraid that the vocals would be intrusive.  So, I decided to just abridge the vocals.  I hope you enjoy this abridged version of 'Help'.  I also hope you enjoy the new version of 'I Want To Hold Your Hand'.  I think this is one of the best abridged versions of any Beatles song.  Thank you for watching!

Amazon video: John Lennon: 'Imagine'

I am very proud to present this abridged version of John Lennon's 'Imagine'  because it is one of the best Beatles songs ever.

The music is also very good.  This abridged version is a great example of exactly what a great abridged version should do.  John Lennon's music is so powerful that it can be difficult to

Amazon review: The First Cut Is the Deepest" is a 1967 song written by Cat Stevens, originally released by P. P. Arnold in May 1967. Stevens' own version originally appeared on his album New Masters in December 1967. This one is OK, but CAt's version is the best.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: Shania is my favorite female artist of all time, and one of my favorite artists as well. So, I was so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song. But, I was horribly disappointed when I heard this song. I really expected better from her than this! In the past, I would have bought a Shania CD without bothering to preview it first because I knew that it would be really good, if not excellent. When Shania finally releases her next CD, I'll definitely preview it first, and if it's as bad as "Today Is Your Day," I may not even bother buying it.

Amazon review: This is an AMAZING cd and I have only purchased it for myself. I think that it is a great cd for the price, and I recommend this to everyone I know. I have been blessed with a lot of good music. Now on to the positive songs. I love the song "Just a Little Bit." I don't know why, but it just feels so right to me. Also, I love the song "All I Wanna Do Is Fall in Love" and "Somewhere Over The Rainbow." I also really like "I Found My Place In Blue." It is very similar to the song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" but it is a little bit better. It is a little bit slower and a little bit more mature. I really like all of the songs except for "Just a Little Bit." It is a little bit irritating to me. The song is catchy, but a little too much. I think that it is a little bit irritating to some people.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.
