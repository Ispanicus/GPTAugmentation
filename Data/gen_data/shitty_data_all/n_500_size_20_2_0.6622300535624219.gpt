Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: Not bad.  I like the songs, but I'm not really into the hard rock sound. I think it would be better if they just focused more on the vocals.  I don't know, the vocals aren't that memorable.  It's not bad.  I like the songs, but I just don't think the album is all that great.

I like the new Killers album, I'm not a big rock guy, but to me it's just not as good as the original Killers.  There are a few songs here and there that I do like, but overall, it's just not as good as the original.  For me it's just the same old same old.  I don't know, it's just not the best Killers album.  It's not bad.  I like the songs, but they're just not that great.  It's not bad.  I like the songs, but it's just not my favorite.  I like the songs, but it's just not as good as the original.

Amazon review: I agree. I was completely dissapointed. I was hoping for more songs. I have always been an avid fan of the bands and I have always loved them for what they stand for. Not only that but I like the way they interact with the fans. It is just so damn exciting to see them. I have been a fan since the beginning of the band. Their music has always filled me with joy and I love it to death. Their first time being on my show it was a very emotional show. I was there with my husband. It was amazing. Seeing them perform in the video was amazing. I hope they get back together, but I am not holding my breath. Their first show was a disaster. I was actually very dissapointed that I did not get a chance to see them play live. I was expecting to see them live and hear them play their music. The only reason I am not dissapointed that I did not get to see them live is because I was there with my husband. I hope they do do another tour. I would love to see them play live as well.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album a lot. I feel it's the best out of all his solo albums. One of his best, but not as good as what he did with band. He used his whole band, and I don't think that was the best way to go about it.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Roger Waters. I have all his solo albums, and am a huge fan of The Wall. I love all of his work with Pink Floyd. Of course I was a big fan of the album that he worked on with the band of course I'm all about everything he's ever done solo. When I heard that he was going to work with a vocalist I was stoked. I wanted to hear him sing along. I was a big fan of his solo work with Pink Floyd though. I wasn't really a fan of his solo work with The Wall though. I liked the album with the band, but I don't know if I liked the album with the band better.

Amazon review: A few years ago, I worked at a small record label on the East Coast. We would come in to do business with the local artists, then go to the studio and work on the album. I'd get the album, and we'd go to the studio to do the mastering. This was before CDs. There was no room for error. The albums were put on the machine and we'd have to wait for them to be done before we could listen to them. Now, after making a CD, you can listen to it and it will make an "album." That's great!

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Not that it was ever all that great.  I had to get the second disc for a couple bucks, and it was just that, a second disc.  It wasn't even a good second disc.  The first disc was just the band playing a little of themselves over the first disc's songs.  The second disc was the same thing, but it was also a CD.  I have no idea why they released it the way they did.  At best it was a joke.

Amazon review: I was very excited about this album.  It sounded great, and they were really good live.  But, once it began to play, the band fell apart.  Too many bad songs.

I didn't like it, but it was the first review I had seen about the band.  It didn't matter to me.  I had gotten the CD, so I paid the price.  I gave it to my wife as a gift.  She listened to it an hour, and then threw it in the garbage.  It was a waste of money.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

It's just plain boring and forgettable.  And I don't really like the music.  I don't even know why I bought the CD, but I did.  I didn't care for it, but I had to have it, and the only songs I didn't like I didn't like very much.  So, I must have bought it for the songs.

Amazon review:  I am really not sure what to make of this record.   I have only listened to a couple of the songs, and while I don't think I was wrong at any point in my review, I think that perhaps some of the reviews that I have read are based on their own interpretation of the album.  I would have to say that this is definitely one of the better CD's of the year.  I also have to disagree with one reviewer who felt that the band sound was not as exciting as the previous albums.  I personally feel that the band is a bit more accessible.  In terms of sound, of course, they have improved, but it still is not as exciting as their previous efforts.  This album has some great songs, but I don't think that it is one that will leave a lasting impression on anyone.  But, if you like music, or your are a fan of the band, you will definitely enjoy this.

Amazon review: I was so bored with their last album.  I was all ready to check out this CD when it was released.  I had no idea what to expect.  I bought this without hearing it...  I am now in the process of listening to this disc now.  I'm not sure what to make of it.  It is very good, but it just doesn't grab me the way the previous two did.  It seems that the band is trying to reinvent themselves, and in my opinion it seems that they are not doing a very good job.   They have a few good songs, but I don't think this album will leave a lasting impression.  I will say though, that the band did a great job on this album, and the CD sounded great.

I was so excited when I heard that "This is the End" was recorded live in New York and was one of the reasons I purchased this CD.  And I have to say that I am really impressed with the quality of this record.  It sounds great, and there is nothing on this album that makes me want to change the label on it.  I really enjoy the live recordings, and this disc sounds great.  I think that anyone who is a fan of the band, or just a fan of great music, will enjoy this.

I am not sure why this band has not released other great music, but I have come to the conclusion that their problem is that they are trying to be everything to everyone.  I am not sure if I am old school or new school, but they are trying to please everyone with every album.  This is not a bad album, but the songs just don't stand out to me.  I am surprised that people still buy this stuff.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

I believe that he needs a little more money and a little less hair.  He is just too perfect.  I hope he gets that answer and then he can get back to being himself.

Amazon review: I love this song and i think it's the best song of the year.  It's not just a song, it's a piece of art.  I'm glad they have a voice like mine.  I think I'll put my two cents in by singing it.  I hope the band will record it because it's my favorite song and I love kesha.  I hope they don't forget me next year.

Amazon review: I love kesha and this song, and I think she's the best singer of all time.  I'm glad she is trying to get her own music done.  I hope they make a new song for her as many people did for kesha.  I hope that they make a new kesha song, instead of another miley cyrus song.  I hope they choose a kesha song for her.

Amazon review: I love miley cyrus, but this isn't her best song, at least not yet.  My favorite of hers is the song "Gone."  I mean, it's just so beautiful and has a very positive message.  She's making me think of my friends.  I'm thinking of signing this video, but then I saw her talking to her friend and I feel like she's talking to me.  I don't want to go through her problems, but I want to help her.  I hope she gets back in the game, because she's doing really well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't know if I'll ever love miley cyrus, but I do know I'm enjoying this song, "See you again."  I'm glad I found this song.  I'm glad I got the chance to listen to it before I made my decision.  I'm glad I can say I'm going to listen to it again before I choose to leave.  I hope she's going to be ok.  I hope we can find out what's going on with her.  I hope she makes it.  I hope she's happy.  I hope I'm happy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the sound of miley cyrus and I love the song.  I can't wait to listen to it again.  I always want to listen to the other songs of her that I haven't heard yet.  I love her voice.  I love it.  I love it.  I love listening to her voice.  I love her voice.  I love it.  I can't wait for her new music.  I have to wait for it.  I love it.  I can't wait to hear it.  I love the music of miley cyrus.  I love her music.  I love her

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this artist. Not only does she have an amazing voice but her songs are very well written and performed. I find her songs to be very unique and unique in what they bring to the table. Her songs have a great message. I can't imagine what it would be like if she did not have a voice like hers. If you are a fan of music, then you must listen to her.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Kelly Price. Most of her songs that I have not listened to before are very well written. I have heard "I am a Light" and I have to say the lyrics are very touching and have a lot of meaning. I would recommend this CD to everyone. But for people who like to listen to a lot of different songs, this CD might be not a good choice. The music is very boring and I personally do not like it.

Amazon review: Not what I was expecting -- a good, not great album. I was really hoping for a good album with great songs. I was disappointed.  I was a little upset when I heard, "It's Alright (for Lazarus)". The song did not sound like the other songs. It was a little boring. But I really loved it and still do. I would recommend this album to anyone who has an open mind to new artists.

Amazon review: The album is very good. I have found her voice to be very unique. I love the songs and I always like her music. The best thing to happen to this album was the song "All Around The World" being featured on the tv show, Glee. I like the song "All Around The World" because it is very good.
