Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I'm so glad I got to hear this song.  I love this song.  Like listening to Lenny Kravitz's live shows.  Very powerful and emotional.  Lyrics are powerful in a different way.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: This is a very good album, but it will become an unpopular opinion once again.  I'm not a huge fan of techno or electronic music.  But this album is one that is definitely worth listening to.  It has a real feel to it that is unique.  The lyrics are very thought provoking.  I think the most difficult aspect of this album is that it is hard to find a song that isn't repetitive.  With all the songs I've listened to, they all seem to have one thing in common:  They are all very similar.  So, my personal feelings about this album are that it could have been great if the songs weren't so similar.  I would like to see more songs that are unique and have different lyrics.  Also, I would like to see some songs that are just more of the same, but in different forms.

Amazon review: This album is worth a listen.  I have never heard an album quite like it.  There are a few songs I wish they had more of.  But overall, I enjoy this album.  It is very different from the other albums I have listened to this year, and it is a very good album.

Amazon review: This album is really good.  I would say that it was one of the best albums I've ever heard.  I like the music on this album a whole lot.  The lyrics are very thought provoking.

I would recommend this album to all people who like techno/electronic music such as myself.

Amazon review: Hey all,  I just started listening to "Beelzebub" and I love it.  It reminds me of the "Kiss me" from the movie "The Producers".  I have a question,  I just noticed that there's no song titled "Rave 'til Dawn".  Why did they name the album "Rave 'til Dawn"?  I know this song is an excellent song, but why did they leave out the name of the song?  I was looking for the name of the song on the album cover, but I couldn't find it.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

I was expecting a nice melody and nice lyrics, but I instead got a song that is filled with annoying lyrics, an annoying melody, and has an annoying sound. The sound is so annoying that I have to turn it off in my car when I're in the car with my husband and have to turn it back on when we're driving home from visiting my parents. It doesn't sound like a great song, it sounds like a really bad song. I have never heard a song like this before (that's almost sad, because I really like this song). I like the melody and the song but I don't think this is a great song. I would give it a 1 star rating. I will probably never listen to this song again.

I'm not sure where to begin this review. The song itself is alright, but it's not a great song. I would give it a 2 star rating. I found it mildly annoying and would like to have found something that didn't make me feel annoyed. I do like the music, I prefer the melody over the lyrics, and it's pretty good, but it's not the best song I have ever heard.

I'm not a huge fan of this song. It's extremely upbeat and i love the music of the band, but I can't do it justice by trying to say what the song is about. The lyrics are just plain stupid. I guess you could say it's "unintelligible" because it isn't really a song. There is no real plot, or any kind of meaning behind the lyrics of this song. I will probably never listen to this song again.

Amazon review: There's just something about him that takes me away. he's got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This band had a lot of potential, but they just didn't know what to do with it.  They needed a new producer, they needed a new singer.  They needed a different sound.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I'm glad I bought this, as it's not a typical Rod Stewart album.  I've heard him play for many years and I've always loved his voice, but I never really listened to his live stuff.  So, I went to the local record store to look for a copy of this album.  I was looking to buy a CD, but I didn't really need it, so I picked this up instead.  I'm glad I did, as I found some amazing songs.  I'm not a fan of Rod Stewart's singing, but this is a good album.  There's a lot of emotion in his voice, and a lot of great songs.  I'm not a fan of his songwriting, but this is a great album.  I'm a fan of his vocals, his songwriting and his guitar playing.  I'm a fan of his music, but this is a great album.  It's great to hear him sing his own songs.  It doesn't sound like him, but I like what he's singing about.

I bought this album after listening to it 10 times.  I didn't know the artist, I didn't know the concept, and I didn't know the actual songs.  I had to find out about this album on my own.  I was so happy with my purchase, that I bought the rest of the albums.  I'm glad I did, even though I wish I didn't have to put my money into this one.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: This album is so overrated. It's not even a good-sounding album. The songs are boring and the vocal is terrible.

Amazon review: I actually listened to this album for the first time ever when I was in college because I didn't realize you could buy a vinyl copy at the store. So I listened to this on my headphones at a friend's house and her boyfriend was there and I asked him if he had a copy of this album and he said no and I said you need to get it and he said you can't because it's overrated. So he gave me his copy. Anyway, I didn't really like it but I liked the songs on it. This album is not bad at all. It just needs a little more attention to detail to be the album it should be. As for the songs, I liked a few of them. Most of them were just boring, but I liked the one that went with the song "I Don't Want to Be Like You" because it was cute.

Amazon review: Wow! I think this is one of the best albums of the year. It is totally different from what I expected it to be. It is really great. It is not a heavy metal album, but a rock album with a different sound. It is not a "rock and roll" album, but a very "rock and roll" album... A lot of the songs are very "rock and roll" with their rock music... It has a catchy beat with a rock sound to it... It has a lot of songs that are not very heavy metal... It is in the vein of a rock album, but it's not a "rock and roll" album... I really like this album.

Amazon review: This is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. I was already a fan of the Newsboys, and they put out a really nice album, but, this one is really different and has a totally fresh sound. The vocals are nice, and the songs are really good. This is one of the best Newsboys albums, and I really like all of them. I like this album so much, that I bought the entire album. I have only listened to this album a couple times, but I will listen to it more often. It is a very good album.

I like this album. I also like that it is so different from the Newsboys' previous recordings. I don't understand why this one is so different. I don't understand what makes it sound more like The Newsboys. There are some great songs here, but they are just not the same as the Newsboys'. I am glad that this one is different. The Newsboys deserve better.

I don't know why a lot of people like this album. I don't like the singing, but I do like the music overall. I liked the songs, but I wish that the songs were better sung. The vocals are ok, but they are not very good. I can't give this album a high rating because of the singing. It is ok, but I don't think that it is a great album.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This is what I call a "good ol' fashioned good ol' fashioned love song." I love the fact that he sings "I'll do anything for you" with the sincerity and love in his voice, and it goes "I don't know why I would" in the background. It reminds me of the old songs: "I Don't Know Why" by The Beatles, "For The First Time In My Life" by The Monkees, and "I Love Rock 'N Roll" by The Who.

Amazon review: You can tell that the lyrics are written by some guy from the fact that the words are all in one long line. I've heard a lot of songs that have a lot of words in one line, but this is the only song that has a song lyric in one line. That's why I don't like it. This song has the same problem as "Take A Bite Out Of Me" by R. Kelly. R. Kelly is a horrible singer and his lyrics are all in one long line.

Amazon review: This song is very sad. At first I thought it was a love song, but later I noticed that it was more about how the woman is so young and the man never had children. I do enjoy the melody, but I can't really connect it with her feelings.

Amazon review: I love the use of the word "girl" in the song. I think it is a real turn-on. I love women and I love their bodies. This song is great!

Amazon review: I think that this song is about a girl who is so happy and the man is always in a bad mood, and he is never able to forget her. I've never been able to fall in love with a woman, but I could fall in love with a man who was always in a bad mood. This song is real. I don't think that a song like this should be on radio, but I think this song is real and it is very romantic.
