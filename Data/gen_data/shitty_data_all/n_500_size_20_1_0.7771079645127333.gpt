You and I were both born to forget.

I'll miss you like I never missed anyone.

I'll remember you like I never forgot anyone.

You were my last chance to get what I never had.

You were the last thing on my mind.

I will love you like I never loved anyone.

In the morning when I wake up, I'll see you sleeping.

I'll be thinking about you like I never thought about anyone.

I'll forget you like I never forgot anyone.

I'll never forget you like I never forgot anyone.

I'll love you like I never loved anyone.

I'll never love you like I never loved anyone.

I'll remember you like I never forgot anyone.

I'll never forget you.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I bought this DVD expecting it to be a compilation of the first 3 or 4 Creepers albums (i did not find any of them because i thought they were all out of print) and to be able to watch them as i would a music video. i was wrong. I guess you can say that i was expecting some kind of special edition but i was wrong. It is a good compilation of the 1st 4 Creepers albums. It has the album cover, the songs, the liner notes, the lyrics, the production, etc. i would have rated it 8/10 but it is a waste of money. i do not even bother to listen to it.

Amazon review: I bought the Creepers Cali collection, but I am not satisfied with it. I think the CD version is better, in my opinion. I thought they were going to put together a compilation of the first 4 Creepers albums, because i thought they were out of print. I was wrong. I was expecting a compilation of the first 3 or 4 albums, i thought they were out of print. They did not put my expectations together, instead they took my money with a compilation of a handful of the albums. The CD version is better. There are only 4 Creepers albums, 4 songs and they are all on the CD, on a single CD, instead of on two CDs, like it should be. I would rate it a 3.5, but for my money, I would rate it a 4.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: He said he was a diehard but I didn't know what that meant.  It means he only listens to the best, all the time, all the time.  It's as though his head is a super vacuum cleaner, sucking in all the great music around, but when he pulls it up he's left with a few very mediocre tracks.  The best I can say is that he's a diehard.  I can not wait to hear his new album.

Amazon review: The band sounds like they were playing a rock band with a lot of lead guitar and not a lot of vocals.  They could have used a better singer, but the sound they make is solid enough and I think it would have been a good album. I think the band is doing great.  They recently won the best local band competition.  I have been waiting for a new album because I like the bands that I have been listening to and I think they are great.  I would love to see more of them in the future.  One of the reasons I like this band is because I can relate to the lyrics.  The band sounds like they are having a good time.  Their lyrics are a lot more personal than many of the bands I listen to.  The band sounds like they are having a good time.  I would love to see more of them in the future.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: There isn't really too much here to like.  The only good song is the lead single, "The End" and the title track.  The rest of the songs pretty much suck.

The songs are mixed really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,really,really,really,really,really,really,really,really.  The songs are mixed so much that if you try to keep up, you end up hearing the same song 4 times.  I really wish that there were more songs here.  The worst song is "New Generation" which is only 4 minutes long.  The worst song is "Rough House" which is only 3 minutes long.  The worst song is "You, Me & We" which is only 3 minutes long.  The worst song is "New Generation" which is only 4 songs long.  The worst song is "Rough House" which is 3 songs long.  The worst song is "You, Me & We" is 3 songs long.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I was very excited to purchase this CD only to get it home and find out how awful it was! Maybe I will grow to like it better if I can stomach to listen to it again. I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban's for years! I feel ripped off and so disappointed!

Amazon review: I purchased this album to listen to through my home stereo. I was expecting the album to be wonderful but it was not. I purchased it because of the song "You & Me." I had a hard time listening to this song because I couldn't understand it and I did not understand how she could sing so well but not know the words. I returned the album because I thought it was a mistake. The fact that the album is censored is unacceptable. The album is NOT for the family.

This review is from: Ur So Gay CD - iTunes

This album is better than the iTunes version. I listen to iTunes versions for some of their tracks and I could not tell the difference, but when I listened to a normal CD, I could tell the difference. This album has a lot of great songs. They are all very different but that's what makes it so interesting. I am glad I listened to this album because I like listening to new music.

Review: Ur So Gay - I’m so happy you liked!

I’m so happy you liked this album! It’s called Ur So Gay and it is a real surprise. It is very different from anything else I’ve heard. I’ve listened to it several times and I love it! You should definitely buy it!

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: I'm not sure how I fell for this one, but I do know I'm glad I did.  The only thing I have to say about this album is that I wish it had the track "Love" as the lead single.

Amazon review: Great album, but only the second CD of this series.  That's not saying much.  The first CD, "Dedicated to You," is just a collection of the tracks that appeared on the previous CDs, and it's the least desirable of the series.  The best songs are on this disc, and all are the same songs on the other two CDs.  It's very short on songs, but they're all good.  The one thing they don't do is play any of the songs twice.  It's very strange to me that they would skip over the single versions of songs that are on two of the other CDs.

Amazon review: I bought this to try to use my CD player for the first time in almost five years.  I've used CD players since I was in junior high (back in the dark ages).  I couldn't get it to work!  I went to the store and got a new one.  I tried the first song, and it worked fine.  I didn't pay any attention to the next song, and it worked fine.  Then I clicked on "Play All" and boom, it was playing the most boring song on this CD.  The first song I chose was "Suffering" and it was just terrible.  I couldn't have listened to any of the other songs for more than five minutes without it stopping.  It was too quiet and the music was too soft and too slow.  It's just not my CD player!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked the album, but it's not for everyone.  I found it very hard to hear some of the songs in a crowded environment (such as in a school auditorium), but others in a quiet setting (such as on a boat) worked great.  I definitely tried "Suffering" without headphones, and while I could hear it, I would have liked it more if I hadn't had to turn down the volume.  Overall, I enjoyed the songs as well as the rest of the album, and it's a worthwhile purchase.  I would say to use this album for the people who are hard of hearing, but I doubt that anyone would listen to the CD after that.  It's also a great choice for people who can't stand the sound of their stereo.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not only was I able to hear the most of the music in a crowded environment, but I was able to hear a lot of the songs in a quiet environment as well.  My wife is hard of hearing, and I can't hear her in anything other than a very quiet space (such as the bedroom).  I was able to hear the songs in both places.  I would say to use this album for people who are hard of hearing, but I doubt that anyone would listen after that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really disappointed in this album.  It's not a bad album, and the songs are okay, but the fact that the songs are all the same makes them all about the same.  I feel like I should have gotten a refund on this album, but I was going to wait until I saw the other albums, as I really wanted to listen to this.  The album is not bad, but it's just not as good as the others in this series.  Overall, I would say to use this album if you want to buy something to listen to on a quiet night.  I would also say to get the next album, which is "A World of Wonder," which has the same songs, but with much better quality.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very good.  I think it's definitely the best in this series.  It's by far the best in the series.  The songs are very well done, but I really liked the songs that were not on the first two CDs.  I would say to use this album if you want to buy something to play on a quiet night.  I would also say to get the next CD, which is "A World of Wonder," which has the same songs but with much better quality.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I don't know why people don't like it.  If you're a fan of the first two CDs, this album is a must.  It's very easy to pick the songs that you want to put on your
