Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I really enjoy the band's music, so when this CD came out, I was excited to hear what it was all about.  After listening to the album, I realized that this is not a band's to look up to, and that my expectation was not in line with what the band has to offer.  I guess I would have to say that this is a band to avoid, and maybe I should have listened to their other albums and listened to them in a different order.  I really don't know what I was expecting.

Amazon review: This album was one of the most disappointing albums I have ever listened to.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If this was a live album, I would give it a five-star rating. However, the band hasn't changed their style at all, and this album is no different. For a band that is still young, they are still doing the same old stuff they've done for the past 20 years. I don't know if it's just the way I listen to it, but this is just another boring album.

Amazon review: The best live band I have ever seen and the only one that I was really disappointed in.  They were great live, but the production is bad, the vocals really suck, and the lyrics are really weak.  But I guess there's some truth to the lyrics.. the most recent live show I saw was at a club in NYC.  The crowd was very energetic, with a lot of dancing and the band was playing awesome live.  They are probably one of the best live bands I have ever seen.  They play a mixture of different rock, punk, and metal styles.  The show started at 11:30pm and ended at 1am.  They played their first 4 songs and there was a lot of energy and excitement in the crowd.  However, by the time they were done playing, it was pitch black, and it was like a ghost town.  The crowd dispersed to find a spot to sit down, and if they didn't leave in like 5 minutes, they were kicked out.  It was really disappointing.  The venue is a bar so I don't know how many people they could have had there.  It was probably around 60-70 people in all.  I hope they come back and try again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album and the first two were great, but this album just seemed to be half assed.  The band is so talented and the songs are really good, but the production and the vocals just seem to be poorly done.  The vocals are bad and the guitars are way too loud.  These are pretty important elements to a rock band, but you could have easily replaced them with something else.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's the newest and most recent one, so I guess I shouldn't complain.  I like it.  I think it's one of the better albums of the year so far.  It's just too bad that it didn't have more song.  Maybe they'll come back with another one or two, although it wouldn't surprise me if they went back to the well with a bunch of covers.  I just hope they come back again and make more music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't understand why people say "I love this album and the first two were great" but then say "and this album just seemed to be half assed."  It seems like a good album, except the production and the vocals were extremely poor.  Not good enough to be on an album like this, but not bad enough to be a bad song.  I don't think "The Great Escape" is a bad song, but it's not a good album.  I don't understand why people say "I love this album and the other two were great" when it seems like they have done enough songs.  I really don't understand it, because the production is fine.  A good producer could make this sound better.  The vocals need to be a little more on point, but on a good album, you can't expect perfection.  I'm pretty sure I could put together a decent album of songs if I had enough time to put them together, and if I had someone putting my words together for me.  This album does not meet that criteria.  It needs an album of 20-30 songs and a good producer.  I know I'm not the only one that thinks that, but I think it's true.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this cd over and over again.  Sometimes I listen in  the shower and other times I listen to it on my car stereo.  It is not easy to find any music that is not  cheesy, but this is a good choice.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Don't be Fooled by the Picture since I first heard it.  I bought this CD for my son who was born in 1997 and he loves his music.  I've had this cd in my car, my nightstand drawer, my son's car, and I have been listening to it on the CD player in my office.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This cd is fantastic. It is not a real CD. But if you don't have a CD player, it's ok. It's great for when you go to listen to music while you drive.  It's a nice way to listen to the radio while driving.

Amazon review:   I am a big fan of Hall and Oats. They are a bit cheesy. But in their music it is okay. They have a good sound and I like their sound. I bought this cd because it is the only one I've never heard of. I didn't know it was different. I thought it was just the same as all of their other CDs. But it is not the same at all.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The sound is a little bit scratchy when the piano is played at the higher speeds. I have always had trouble with the piano sound because I am a sound engineer. Very rich and warm sound.

Amazon review: I enjoy playing this recording. I have had to play it at the lowest speeds and it will sometimes sound like there is a lot of noise. My son plays it and has the same problem. I guess I will have to play it at the highest speeds again and see if it sounds better. Overall I love the sound of this recording. The sound is rich and warm. When I have to play it at very low speeds it sounds good. When I play it at medium speeds it sounds good but I am having trouble picking up the piano sound. When I play it at high speeds it sounds bad. I have read several reviews of this recording and have listened to this recording more than once. I have read that this recording is good for beginning students of the piano. I would like to try this recording and see if it works for me.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This was a great movie! I was looking forward to this movie because I liked the movie "The Green Mile" & the music in it was great. I've been looking for the movie "Christmas in Connecticut" & I wanted to see it in the theatre. I don't know why I've been looking for it & I haven't been able to find it. I didn't have any idea that the movie was coming out until I saw the trailer. So I was very excited & I was looking forward to the movie. It was a great movie! I enjoyed it very much. The music was great & the cast was great. I was glad the movie was coming out! The last song in the movie was really good & I loved it! I still wanted to see the movie & I wasn't disappointed. I loved this movie & I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, but the man who wrote this is an idiot. The musicals are what I love to listen to. I don't really like the shows that are on Broadway. In fact, many shows I love, I also hate. I love the musicals because they are fun and entertaining. If you're a musical fan, or if you're a fan of other shows, then you'll enjoy this CD. I don't know why they have the songs on the CD, unless they just decided not to bring them in the show. I don't know if I'm just missing something, or they just decided not to use them in the show. I don't understand why they didn't use them in the show. I've never seen them in the show. I'm not even sure if they used them in a show or not.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Not a bad album. I was expecting a lot more music from this album. I was disappointed that they didn't do a tour to play all the songs. I want them to perform songs that many people don't know. But as far as the album itself, I think that they have done a good job. I think that it has some great songwriters on the project. I have seen them perform on the stage, and I have seen them on the TV show, and I think that they are very good. I can't understand why they didn't perform all the songs in the show. If you look at the lyrics on the tour, they have all of the songs from the CD in the shows. They have a lot of great songwriters. I think that they should perform all of the songs in the show. Then they should play a lot of new songs that many people don't know.

Amazon review: This is an excellent CD. I love listening to older music, but I think that this album is much better than most of the other ones that are out on the market. I am a fan of the group "The Beach Boys." I have seen them perform in concert many times, but I didn't know that they were going to do a CD of old music. I think that the production value, and the quality of the music is much better than many other ones that I have listened to. I am a fan of the songs on this CD, and I think that there should be a tour to perform all the songs. I want to hear these songs in the show.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The "Songs of John  Williams," Vol. 8, CD  1 (Warner Bros. Records).  My favorite piece from that CD.  The first song, "The Longer End," features some of the best   piano playing I have heard from anyone to date.  Another highlight is "Echoes of the Past," performed by a group of male sopranos who could pass for a male a cappella group.  The sopranos are all very good.

I have been writing a music column in the local paper for the past two years.  I am always looking for new material to write about but I have never heard anything this awesome.  I hope I will not sound like I am bragging, but I am not.  I have been a fan of the music of Linda Ronstadt for as long as I can remember.  I have listened to her records over and over again and have never gotten tired of them.  I think she is the greatest singer who ever lived.  I have always wanted to meet her.  It is a dream of mine to meet her.  I hope I live to meet her.  I am truly touched by her music. I have met her for the first time on this CD.  I have to tell you that the song "I Will" is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  The song "I Think" has some of her best vocal and instrumental playing I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I do not have any musical heroes,  only music lovers.  I have discovered so many great artists  over the years, but none  have resonated with me the way this album does.  "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" is a classic, it was played in the movie "The Sound of Music."  It was also in the movie "Fantasy Island."  The song "The Longer End" is one of the best I have heard in a long time and if I ever get tired of listening to it, I will put it  out of my mind.  The recording of this CD is simply amazing.  It's a real treat to hear her singing.  I have listened to this CD several times already and just want to say that I am a big fan.  You will hear for yourself that this CD is a real treasure.  I am just a sucker for all things    Linda Ronstadt.

Amazon review: This CD does not have a very good title. It has a song with a title that says "Thank God For You". It is actually a song to praise God. A few weeks ago my husband and I were sitting around in the living room praying about our plans for the rest of our lives, and we decided to go on a mission trip to Honduras. We had never been to Honduras before, and we were both so excited, but we were also terrified of the trip. We had been praying for God to take us, and He did. God used this trip to teach us about the Lord, and to help us to know Him so much better. I have never been so excited to go on a mission trip before. The Lord has been leading us in many great ways, and I can't wait to see what He has in store for us next. This CD is a great resource for any Christians who want to learn about the Lord and to praise Him, and it is more than just a CD or CD-ROM.
