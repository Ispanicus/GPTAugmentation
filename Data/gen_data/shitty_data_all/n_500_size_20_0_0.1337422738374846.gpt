Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: The cd is a big hit in my office.  I am a little surprised by this. The only song I have not heard before is "We Are in Love" which is a cover of a song by George Harrison.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I've often said that I'm not a big fan of the Gospel genre, and this album doesn't change that.  There are a few good songs here, but most of the album is pretty good.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

A:

This is a really really really really good CD

To me it sounds as if the phrase "This is a really really really really really good CD" has two meanings. The first one is:

This is a really really really really really good CD.

In other words, you are praising the music itself as a good thing. The second meaning is:

This is a really really really really really really good CD.

In other words, "really really really really really really good" is a more positive word than "really".

 \$3.99 is a very good price for a CD, especially if you plan on buying more copies in the future.

 \$3.99 is also a good price for a CD if you already own a copy and don't want to buy more.

 \$3.99 is a very good price for a CD if you already own a copy and don't plan on buying more, because you'll save a dollar by buying less instead of more copies.

I think the phrase "really really really really really good" is redundant and unnecessary.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very, very short album. The first part of the album is very interesting as it opens with "Hip Hop Meets Religion," a mash up of rappers and spoken word poets such as Tupac Shakur and KRS-One. That is followed by "How We Got Over," a song about how Black women become successful and what it takes to be successful. It is followed by "Can I Be Me," a song by an unknown woman that is written about and sung by the only Black woman to reach the top of the Billboard charts and win a Grammy Award. Her name is Rihanna and she is very talented. This album is written by a talented female writer who should be proud of the work she has done. That is until you get to songs like "The Message," a song that is a tribute to the message of uplifting Black women. The next song, "Duck Soup," is about a woman who has a big problem with her body and she is trying to change her mind and make it better. There are also songs like "All I Do Is Win," which starts with a female rap artist trying to get some cash so she can get her life on track. One of the best songs on the album is "Let Me Love You," a song of love and a good friend who is in prison. There is one more song, "Bitch I'm Black," which is actually the female rapper's story of how she got out of prison and made it big.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm sure you all already know that I love Rihanna. Well, I just saw her live in the U.S. and she blew me away. This is her first album in over three years since she dropped the first album on the Dreamworks label. She has been working on this album and it's amazing. I can't wait to listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is another notch in Rihanna's belt. She has been at the top of the music charts for over a decade now and yet her music has not aged. This album is the best album of 2009 so far. "Umbrella" is the first single, which is a very good song that I am sure will be played in clubs and not on mixtapes. The next single, "Don't Stop the Music" is a great song, which is her theme song for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The album closes with "We Found Love," which is her first album of original songs since her last one. I have never heard Rihanna use that style of music before, it's very pretty. I am not a fan of her music, but I do think this is a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's been a while since Rihanna has released an album and this album is everything I've been waiting for. It's an album that keeps me coming back for more. The first single, "Umbrella," starts this album off with a bang. "We Found Love," follows and is a strong song. "Don't Stop the Music" is the second single but I think Rihanna should have let it go a little longer. It was kind of boring and I think she could have let it go for a while. "Don't Stop the Music" is a great song but I don't think it deserves more time. The album is full of great songs that are catchy and that will keep you engaged, but I think they should have let it go a little longer. I like the album, but I was looking for the single, "Umbrella" and I was disappointed.

Amazon review: I had seen Rihanna for the first time in 2009 at the iHeart Radio Festival in Las Vegas. I was so excited to see her perform; I'm not a fan of Rihanna so I didn't really know what to expect. She performed a couple of songs and I was blown away by her performance. I went back to see her again in 2010 and she was even better. She performed at the iHeart Radio Music Awards and then again at the Billboard Music Awards. I was so happy to see she performed another song at the Grammys. This album is the best so far for Rihanna. I have been waiting for this album since 2009.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is a mix of hip-hop, reggae, and R&B. It's not a bad album, but it's not my favorite Rihanna album to date. This album has some of the best songs but there are others that don't stand out. I think the album is good but not as good as her first two albums. The album is a mix of hip-hop, reggae, andR&B.

Not only are there not any real hits here, but there are also some songs that are not very well written.  The production is very poor.  It's very boring at times.  At times, the band's sound is ok, but when it gets to the slower songs it's not very good.  The vocals are very good but the lyrics are very poor.  I think that the band should try a different sound and a different producer.  I think the band is a great group and I'm excited to get to hear their new stuff.  But, the album is not worth buying.  My girlfriend bought the album and I listened to it on my laptop.  It's not the best thing that I've ever heard.

Amazon review: I don't know how you can leave a song for so long and not hear it.  But I really loved it.  I wish it was longer.  I am going to buy the CD's you have on your site.  I need to know who the artist is because I am not sure which one is his.  I love the song "I Don't Want You"  so much.  I would have bought the album if you had let me know there were other songs.  I have been a fan for a long time, so I was expecting the CD's to be long.  I am going to purchase them for my family.  I do have a question.  Why did you change the name of the song to "I Don't Want You"  when you released the album earlier this year?  It's a very catchy song.  I feel like the song is a little too long.  I don't understand why you changed the name.  I am going to get the CD's.  Thank you for writing the song.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Demi, for a long time.  I bought the "I Don't Want You" CD  because I thought it was a great song.  Then I bought the album "I Don't Want You"  because I thought it was even better.  The songs on the album are longer and the songs are very repetitive and boring.  The CD is very long and the songs are repetitive and boring.  I would have bought the CD  originally but I can't stand it.  I wanted to buy the CD  originally but I can't stand it.  I am not a fan of the song because it's too long.  I am going to buy the CD  originally but I can't stand it.   I had to get it used.  I just wanted to say that.  I will buy the CD  originally but I can't stand it.
