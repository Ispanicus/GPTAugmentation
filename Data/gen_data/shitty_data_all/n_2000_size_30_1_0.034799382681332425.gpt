Amazon review: This is a beautiful and emotional song. It shows you so much in just one listen, in a way that is hard to describe. The lyrics are not terrible, but they lack any real meaning. It is just pure beautiful emotion. I can appreciate it for what it is: a beautiful love song.

Amazon review: One of the most overlooked albums in it's respective genre in the last 10 years
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Oh God, the bass is like a tractor beam. I don't want to go into any more details on the rest of this album, but it is the best I've ever heard. The album is just as much of a spiritual masterpiece as it is a dance/jazz/pop/electronica/electro album.

Amazon review: So this is another collection from a small group of bands that are now all out of their minds. I don't know how people in the know are able to put a name to the bands they've been listening to for the last 5 years, but I assure you, they don't have a name. If I were to name them, I'd call them, "Mallions."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album art looks like a really good version of a photo of a group of friends having a good time. The title, "Mallions," sounds like a band I'd actually want to listen to. The music is very uplifting. I mean, the lead vocals are pretty good. I like how the album doesn't stick to one genre. I like how they are totally open to the idea of combining styles. I like how they don't try to be a "group." I really like how they mix things up. I like the production. I like the instrumentation. I like everything about the album. It's just a really good album.

Amazon review: I was a little bit hesitant to buy this album, because I wasn't sure if I would like it. After all, it's a jazz album, but I've only heard a few jazz albums that I really liked. Well, it's not just jazz, this album rocks. On every song, the band plays with full force, and you can feel the energy from every player in the band. The sound in the band is very clear and they have a lot of energy on each track. The lyrics are very good also, and I think they are relevant. The music is very good. The band plays with lots of energy and the vocals are very good. The album has lots of energy and a lot of good energy to it. It's a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album. I've been listening to it for the last few years but I'd never bought it before. I thought it was a bit odd. I never knew that it was a jazz album. It's a mix of rock and jazz, but it was a bit off. This album just had to be bought. I've been listening to it ever since I bought it. It's a great album. This is probably my favorite album of all time. I've been listening to it for over 20 years. It was a gift from my father-in-law. I've listened to it a lot and I love it. I've had this album for 20 years and I still love it. I'm a big fan.

Amazon review: I've only just started listening to this album and it's so good. I just bought an MP3 player and I've been playing this constantly.

Amazon review: While the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to Dylan's Judas moment, I still recommend this wonderful series. My baby fell asleep within 20 minutes of first firing it up, and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for The Pixies to share with me in the future. The Stones one is good too.  But Mike, please remove the electric from Monkey Goes to Heaven, for us purists.

Amazon review: I have heard this song and it is a nice song.  The beat gets old after a while.  When I listen to this song I always get the feeling the song has been recycled.   I think the beat was done by different people.   I think some of the instruments were done by different people.   I think the song was made to be a re-recording of the original.    I think the original had so many different people helping that it was never the same.    I think the original song was very good.   I think all the different people that helped on the original version of the song made it a great song.    I think the song was very good.    This version is not as good as I thought it would be.  I don't think this version was made to be a rerecording of the original version.    I don't think this version was made to be a remix.

Amazon review: This song makes me so sad, but it makes me smile.  In this music the lyrics are so powerful and sad that I can completely relate to them.  You can tell that the song is about someone who has been through a lot in life.   The song talks about how hard it can be to deal with tragedy.   The song talks about how we go through so many things in life.    I like the message in this song.  I like the lyrics.   I think that the song is very well done.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was eagerly looking forward to this CD after watching Hollie on Britain's Got Talent on YouTube.  When I first played it I thought something had gone wrong with my sound system.  After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

Amazon review: Heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer.  Not much!  He gave it his all when singing with her, but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album.  Didn't sound as though he was giving it his all!  Sorry!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't even know Hollie had an album.  Wow!  He sounds amazing!  I was thrilled until I realized that he sounded a little bored.  He had the right spirit and the right attitude, but the production left much to be desired.  He sounded like he was playing an acoustic guitar with his hand on the strings, not a full band.  He tried hard, but it didn't really come through, especially on the songs he was singing with his mom.  I really like the fact that he sings with his mom, but his singing is lacking much of the emotion that his voice should have.  I really like him, but the production could have used a little more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I never heard Hollie until he was on Britain's Got Talent.  He was very good.  He performed with his mom and it sounded like he was playing a guitar in the background with her singing along.  I hope he's getting more exposure, because he really has a beautiful voice.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was looking forward to this CD since it was coming from Britain.  I loved his voice and the way he sang with his mom.  He sounded so authentic and I was just a little skeptical when he said at the end of the song, "I love you".  I was a little disappointed when he didn't say "I love you, Mom".  I would love to hear him sing with his mom.  At the very least he should have said "I love you, Mom".  It would have been a great ending to the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was surprised to hear Hollie sing on Britain's Got Talent.  I was expecting him to sound a little robotic.  I was also a little disappointed when he said at the end of the song "I love you, Mom".  I was hoping he would say "I love you, Mom, and you, Dad".  Instead, he said "I love you, Mom, and you, Dad, and you, Mom".  That's not the way it should be said.  It's not the same as "I love you" or "I love you, Mom".  He should have said "I love you, Mom, and you, Dad".  It would have made the CD more special.

Amazon review: I heard this album only because of a friend who posted the track list on her wall.  I listen to it at least once a month.  He's a very talented singer and he sounds great.  I'm not very happy with the production though.  I wish there was more "oomph" from the speakers.  The sound was a little muted.  It sounds like he's singing through his headphones.  It sounds like he's singing through his headphones, playing an acoustic guitar with his hands on the strings.  It didn't sound like he was using his whole voice.  It just sounded like he was singing through his headphones.  I was very disappointed.  I guess I'll have to listen to it some more.

Amazon review: I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation.  I personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss. Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again.  Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album itself is excellent, just not the way it is packaged.  I was disappointed in the overall sound quality, which is not great, but not terrible as well.  I like the album and will be purchasing it on CD.  But this release of the album is not the way it should be packaged.  The album itself is not as good as it should be, but the way this album is packaged is not the way I would have liked it to be.  It is supposed to be packaged in a hard cover case with lyrics and liner notes.

If you don't have a great set of speakers, and if you don't like loud music, then this album is not for you.  To me it just seems like a little too much music for one CD, and it's not very long, so you can probably listen to it in less than an hour if you like it.

I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all.

He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review:   This is a great record, especially if you like a lot of rock and roll and don't mind some of the more raucous party rock.  However, if you are a fan of the more traditional sound or prefer more ballads, you'll be disappointed.  All the songs have their own unique sound.  The title track is a beautiful ballad and the other two songs are very good.  The production is very good and the songs are very strong.

Amazon review:   The sound of the band is not very dynamic, which makes it difficult to distinguish the individual members.  I think the band members are excellent on their own (except for Shinedown's vocals) but they do not really stand out on the album.  The other songs are very good.  I like that they don't sound like a typical rock and roll band and that they have a unique sound.

I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

I don't know what the other reviews are talking about about the production.  I loved Gods of War.  I love the new album.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.

Amazon review: This band was my religion and my law for years.  That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this.  Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal.

Amazon review: If you are looking for a good, fast, heavy album, then this is the one.  I can't say the same for the rest.  The vocals are the only thing that stand out.  The guitars are good, but the drumming is very dull and boring.  This CD is not for the weak of heart.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I thought they were going to be another one of those bands that I hear about - but they've been around for decades.  I'm a big fan of their early work.  They are one of the most underrated bands of all time.  I am a huge fan of their first two albums, So Far Away and This is the New World.  I love the way they use instruments in their music.  My band's name is the same as their last name.  It's very catchy.  I love the song and album covers of this band.  I just thought I would share my own personal opinion.  I just really like this band.  I've been listening to them for the last 10 years and have been a fan ever since.  They have been a part of my life for a long time.  I can't wait for their next album.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Hopefully this band paid for the rights to use these artists songs.  VERY MISLEADING AND DISAPPOINTING!

There is a problem with the title of this song. When it's played, it appears to be a part of the chorus of the other song. Then, when played in reverse, it appears to be part of the chorus of the other song. I've been told this is not a mistake, but a deliberate attempt to confuse the listener. I don't really know what to do with this information.

This is a song I've been playing on and off.  I've recorded it a few times, even though I don't own the original recording.  This is one of the few songs I've ever attempted to record for the first time.  It didn't turn out to be a very good recording.

There are many reasons why I don't think this song is good.  But the reason why I'm listing it here is because it was nominated for a Grammy Award and I don't want my vote to go to someone who is trying to improve their chances of winning a Grammy Award.

The song is a great example of what can be done with a guitar.  You can add a lot of depth and texture to a song by using the guitar as a tool.

The guitar solo is not very good, but it is what it is.  The guitar solo is not very good because the guitar part just isn't very good.

The most important part of the guitar solo is how it's played.  The part when it's played in the chorus of the main song makes the song better.  The way the guitar solo is played in the chorus makes the guitar solo better.  The guitar solo doesn't necessarily have to be played that way.  It's just what it is, and that's fine.  But I prefer to have the guitar solo played the way it's played here.  I think it's better to have it played the way it's played in the chorus of the main song.  The guitar solo is a nice, simple part of the song.

The most important part of a guitar solo is how it's played.  The part when it's done in the chorus of the main song makes the song better.  The guitar solo in the chorus of the main song is played in a way that makes the guitar solo better.  But the guitar solo is not the best part of the song.  I prefer to have the guitar solo played the way it's played in the chorus of the main song.

I don't think the song is very good.  I prefer to have the guitar solo played the way it's done in the chorus of the main song.  The guitar solo is a simple part of the song that doesn't need to be better than it already is.  The guitar solo might sound good in the chorus of a song, but it wouldn't be the best part of the song.  The guitar solo might seem to be a little better than what it is, but it's not that more, it's the same.  The guitar solo might be a little better than what it is, but it's not that much more.  The guitar solo might be a little better than what it is.  I prefer to have the guitar solo played the way it's supposed to be played in the chorus.  The guitar solo might be better than what it is, but it's not that much better.  The guitar solo is better than what it is.

There is a good reason why I don't think this song is good.  If it was any good, I wouldn't have listed it here.  I would have been satisfied with the fact that it was a good song.

There is nothing wrong with this song.  I'm not saying it's a bad song, but if it was any good, I wouldn't have listed it here.  This song would not be on my list of songs that I think are good songs.  I would have been satisfied with the fact that the song was a good song that I liked.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: As a heavy metal head, I'm always looking for new sounds.  The new tracks on this album are great, but I'm not sure I would have taken the time to buy this one if it wasn't for the fact that I have other musical instruments that don't work as well as my computer.  A few notes here and there on the instruments are better than the music.  I mean, I can listen to almost anything I want on my computer, and there's no way I'd buy music that I can't play on my computer.

Amazon review: The first time I ever saw a video of a band playing was a live show in a tiny basement bar in New York.  I was very young and didn't know what to expect, but I was excited when I saw the band in person.  I was even more excited when I saw them in their home town of New Jersey and saw a few friends who were also fans.  The band was pretty good, but I didn't know what to expect from their live set.  I just knew I would love it.  The show was amazing and everything they played was amazing.  And, this is from their first two albums.  The live show was amazing and they have been on some great tours, but I still haven't heard the new album.

I've listened to it more than any other album in a long time.  I don't really have a favorite song on the album.  They're all awesome.  I like the songs a lot.  I like the guitar sound.  I like the drum sound.  I like the vocals.  I also like that one song has a different guitar solo than the rest of the songs.  I have no idea who the guitarist is.  And,  at the end of the album, there's a surprise song that I'm sure many fans will like.   But,  I don't know if I'll be able to get through it.  I know the band was just starting out, but they had a great first album.  And,  I'm sure the songs they've done since have been better than the first.

The guitar sound is good.  I like the bass.  It's loud.  It's strong.  They're good.  They're not to complex.  The song was great.  It was different from the songs they've done in the past.  There are some new songs here that I like.  But,  I'm also not really sure how I feel about this album.  It's a good album.  I like the songs a lot.  I like the guitar.  I like the drums.  I like the vocals.  I like that one song has a different guitar solo than the other songs.  I have no idea who the guitarist is.  And there's a surprise song that I'm sure many fans

Amazon review: I have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 as a member of brogian bards and independent solo artist and have never heard something that I didn't like and usually loved  Marc Gunn is talented in many different hats such as podcaster for Celtic music in many different formats  listen to him again and again  as he always makes you feel ultimately good  even his death song album. his takes and twists on scifi and parody are among the best

It is a pity that the arias and songs are subjected to such a cruel torture.

Amazon review: This song has an absolutely lovely melody.  The lyrics, however, are not to be trusted.  The voice sounds like a dying woman, and the lyrics are a series of questions.  "Will I be alright?...Will I die?"  Who said that?  And what does it mean?

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this song, the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me, but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song, one of his favorites, he thinks it's really romantic etc.... Not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so I decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix CD for Valentine's day. I've always known the lyrics were romantic, but they have more meaning for me now.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I recently bought the album and I have to agree with the other reviewers.  It is a very good album, but I do not recommend it for anyone under 18.

It does not look like it will arrive very soon so I will have to wait until it arrives and then post my review.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Christmas music. I like this CD for its very jingly tune and for the very jingly lyrics of the song "Jingle Bells". I love all the Christmas songs, and this CD is no exception. I think this is a great collection of Christmas music.

Amazon review: I bought this as I had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen. I was pleasantly surprised. From the first listen I felt I could follow the story before reading the synopsis and I was humming some of the tunes. I couldn't wait to play it again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Top of my list. Do you like to dance, to get your groove moving. Elle King, where is she on the charts? She should be ranking up there.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation, this album is just as good or better. WHAT?!  If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.  If a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldn't be bluegrass.  When U2 decided to go electronica on their Pop album it sucked.  That's what this is.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Something is up with the sound quality of this. I purchased it through Amazon and received a digital download. The sound quality is weak, I don't know if I should try this again? Are the CD's similar in sound quality? It's as if too many Db's are being pushed through the system and you can tell a weakness in sound even at a low volume. it's weird!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have heard a couple of the songs and they sound pretty great. I'm hoping to get an mp3 of one of the tracks and listen to it while I'm working. I will let you know what happens.

###
Amazon review: I've listened to all of the tracks of this album and I love it. The music is a mixture of metal, grunge, blues and a little bit of country mixed in. The album is in my top 5 and I've listened to it about 7 times. I'm very happy with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am very pleased with this album. I have listened to it about 15 times.  I like it a lot. There are a couple of songs that are a little repetitive, but the best part is the songs that are just for songs! The lyrics are brilliant and the musicianship is top notch.  I would recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am very exited to have all of this I love it.  It's a good mix of rock, blues and country music.  I loved all of the songs, but the best part is it's all great songs.  The best part is you get to listen to all of the songs and you don't have to purchase them all at once.  It's a great album. I'm glad I got it.  As for the packaging, it is very cheap to ship and it's got a very good sound.  Good deal.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my top album.  I love all the songs.  I really like how they mix rock music with blues and country.  They put a little bit of everything in there and they do it very well.  When I first started listening to this album I thought it was a little boring, but now that I listen to it again I like it more.  The only thing I didn't like about it is the song "The Road Goes on Forever".  I really don't like that song or any of the songs with lyrics.  I believe it is a little too long.  It's been pretty long since I listened to any metal.  It has a really good beat on it, but I do wish they would have put a little bit more guitar in there.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes metal.  It's a good mix of everything.  It's a good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I loved all the songs on this album, but I didn't like the songs that I couldn't understand because of the rapping and singing.  It was fun to listen to though, I would definitely listen to this again.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes rock music.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I went to the store and bought this for my son.  He was not too excited about it, but I said he could open it if he wanted.  I was impressed when he opened it up and started to play with it.  I had him play the first song, the second song, and the end song and could see improvement.  The third song did not last long, he was tired and went to bed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not my cup of tea.  I tried playing my son's copy and had to put it down when he got too excited.  I am going to give this a wide berth.  I'll give it another listen and see if I can find something that he likes.  It's probably a safe bet that he will like it.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewers.  I purchased this for my nephew and he LOVES it.  He is only 4 and he LOVES to put his hands in his mouth, especially with the music.  It is a nice change to have him listen to music without his hands all over it.

Amazon review: A rehash of very old Willie.  50 poorly recorded cuts of the 'early' years.  Total disappointment.  Look for better collection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first few cuts are the best.  It is then that the songs that sound like the old Willie gets old.  The first two were great. The rest are more like a modern ballad than Willie.  This is a good start.  A few more cuts will make it better.  The best song is the one with the story.  The rest just sound like ballads which doesn't make you feel the song.

Amazon review: I like the original but I would have preferred a little more diversity in the songs.  I like the vocals but not the piano/guitar.  It doesn't sound like Willie.  Some of the guitar playing is repetitive.  I like the melody but not the lyrics.  I would have liked some of the songs that I don't know.  I don't know if I will buy this.  I will probably borrow it from a friend.  I only have an hour so I can't put a lot into it.

Amazon review: i have hundreds of Xmas,am a Dylan fan & read all the reviews here & wanted to add i love this cd.  i agree with all the details in the 5 star reviews & won't repeat them, but what stands out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangements here.  it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & Dylan's raspy voice adds the spice & crackling of the logs.  for me, this cd feels like Xmas as much as Sinatra, Manilow or Bing.  unlike other big name stars who make the obvious Xmas collection, Dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes me want to play it over & over.

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre. The others are fairly consistent with BWB's usual work. I'm not sure what intent for that was, but the next album needs to be smooth jazz through and through, not this.

Amazon review: I am the sort of person who would like to hear what the world sounds like without being bombarded by the latest pop hits. I listen to a lot of classical music, but in general, I don't want to have to download a whole album just to hear a particular song. I've come to understand that this is the way the music industry works, and, while I don't complain about the way things are done, I don't like the fact that I'll have to buy a whole album just to hear one or two of its songs. I've got all of the albums I need to listen to on iTunes, but if I wanted to hear all the music in my collection, I would have to buy it all. This is a great album.

Amazon review: After listening to this CD, I am almost certain I have a new favorite singer.  This singer is such an amazing blend of talent and heart.  I would love to see her perform live in front of a live audience.  I would hope that she would take the opportunity to sing one of my favorite songs, "I Will Always Love You" with her voice truly soaring above the audience.  I hope she would perform this song at the Smithsonian, or in front of the White House.
