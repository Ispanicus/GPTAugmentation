I don't know if you've tried the service, but there's actually a free option to add your own music library here.
http://music.pandora.com/
It doesn't have the same quality as the paid service, but there's also a free option here for you to add your own music.

A:

I'm a bit late to the party but I'd like to add my thoughts.
I had a bit of a problem with this service, as I had problems with getting my songs to work.
After some of the comments in this thread my best option was to use a service that was free.
I was able to add my own songs and have them show up on the app.
If you have the paid account, get a trial for the service.
And if you don't have a paid account, get a free trial here.
I was able to get a song from the free trial and it showed up in the library.

 

 

I was able to make my app work right after I signed up for the service.
It was a little frustrating because they needed access to my iTunes account in order to add the songs and they required me to pay $10 per song.
I hope this helps!

 

 

 

A:

I've been using Pandora since a few months. I'm in the process of moving to a new residence and don't want to use my old service.
It's really convenient to just have my music in the app and not have to connect to iTunes and pay for it.

 

 

 

 

A:

I recently bought a subscription to the service and love it. 
I was having a problem with the songs not showing up in the app on my Galaxy Nexus (7.0) and after a lot of research I found out that it was because I had not paid.
So I went to the site and added my songs, and now they show up in my app.

 

 

 

 

It took me a bit of time, but once I got the hang of it it was so easy. The site is very easy to use, and my songs show up in the app.

 

 

 

 

I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: This song was written by Death Cab for Death Cab and is the first song on their new album, Death Cab for Cutie.  This song is probably the most enjoyable song on the album and it is a very catchy tune, in fact, it is one of my favorites.  This is the song that I wish had been on the first album.  This song reminds me of the days of a couple of years ago when I was a teenager.

I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy".

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

I have always been fascinated by the music of the Beatles. I am not exactly a Beatles fan, but at the same time, I love their music.
I found this song really cool and i love it. The message is very positive. I am not a fan of the Beatles, but i am glad i found this song. I am a fan of the Beatles, but for some reason, i am not able to listen to them.

I have recently fallen in love with the Beatles and I am learning a lot from the music they have created. I'm still not sure why I like them so much, but I do, and I'm so glad that I now have an appreciation for them. As a teenager, I was too young to even really care about the Beatles, but now I'm really excited that I found this song from them. I was able to hear exactly what it sounded like, and it was so cool. I just love the Beatles music, and this song was a great addition to my collection. I'm definitely going to buy this song again.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The first half of the album is very good. I enjoyed the song "No-Limit" (not to be confused with "No Limit" by Sugar Hill Gang), "Wedding Bells" (a very short song) and "Gonna be a Heartbreaker" (the best country song of all time). But then the second half of the album is just an afterthought. I don't know what happened to these songs. They are all good enough to listen to, but not good enough to listen to more than one time.

Why did they have to put "Wedding Bells" in the middle of the album? "Wedding Bells" is a very short song, and I would have preferred a song that was at least half as long as it was.

Amazon review: There is nothing really to dislike about these music tracks.  The quality of the tracks are excellent.  The only flaw is that they are fairly short compared to other music you buy from Amazon.  The length of the tracks isn't a real problem because it's not like you're hearing something for 10 minutes and then it's over.  It's more like you're hearing something for a minute and then it's over.  There is nothing really to dislike about these songs.  The only problem is that they are only available for a maximum of 30 days.  If you don't want to buy the music after 30 days, you can get a refund.  I don't know if this is the case because I haven't actually bought them yet.  I have had this song downloaded for a few weeks but I haven't bought it yet.  I don't want to buy the songs until I know what the song is about.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I love this CD I have listened to it all the time and the only thing I don't like about it is the CD is made in the USA and I would like it to say "Made in England" but I don't see how that could be possible. I really like this album and I am 12 years old.

This album is awesome. I love the message that is in the songs. It is well written and I am very happy with this album. I listen to this CD while I am in the back seat of my car.

This is an excellent album. I have listened to this CD all the time

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  How is it possible that you can be a fan of this group (The Bee Gees) yet be oblivious to their music?  It's like being a fan of the Grateful Dead yet not being aware that they played the music of the Grateful Dead all of their lives.

###
Amazon review:  This is an amazing group, and a lot of their songs are timeless in their own right.  This is not really a "best of" list, more of a best of the best.  Not one song is better than the other in my book, but this is not a "best" list in the sense that there isn't one best song.  As with all groups, there's a best album for each member.

Amazon review:  One of the greatest songs of all time.  The beat is awesome, and you can hear the emotion and passion of the band.  The group also does not write songs like this anymore.  There are many other songs of this quality, but this is the one you should go back to in order to re-experience the feeling of euphoria, and the love in your heart when the band performs this song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This group has a great sound and a great voice, and they always put on an amazing show.  Their music is not for everyone, but if you have a little ear for music and like to listen to some good music, go out and buy this album.  It's worth it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I was looking for a Beatles-type album, but I found this album to be more like a Motown album.  The band had great harmonies.

The album cover was designed to be more of an album cover than a record cover.

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: This is a great song. It's not overly complicated, or contrived, it's a bit more on the simplistic side, but it's very well written and sung. And the video is hilarious, I think the "kids are running around and yelling" part is kind of hilarious. Just a lot of good songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Another solid record for Prince. I had a lot of fun listening to this and don't get me wrong, it's not the best music I've ever heard, but it's not bad either. It's more like the last of four albums that I listened to and this is the best.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Some of Prince's best music. This is one of the best songs to be released on the '80s.  This song is just as good as the one right after "The Beautiful Ones (Are the Beautiful)" or "Halo in the Sky" or even "You'll See."  I was so impressed by this song that I purchased the CD on my own.  Thank you Prince for your genius.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is another good song. I can see why it is named "The Most Beautiful".  I love this song. It's a perfect example of Prince singing what he sees.  It's not too fast, doesn't make you want to throw your iPhone out the window, and it doesn't sound like a robot from outer space. It's a great song.
