Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: As a long time fan of R.Kelly's music, I had high hopes for this album. I was hoping that he would do something outside of the trap sound that we had come to expect over the last few years. I was also hoping that he would go back to his roots in the gospel music that he was known for. Well, I guess I was a little disappointed when the album was released. This album is very much like the other R.Kelly albums I've listened to, and that's a bad thing because I like R.Kelly's music. I love the gospel music. I love the way he talks about his wife and the way he opens up about his personal life and struggles. But he does not make any effort to change the trap sound. He uses samples and uses other musicians such as The Notorious B.I.G. to create his own unique sound. The only things that stand out in this album are the songs "How I Got Over" and "No Control". I loved them both and would love to have them on my iPod. The album is good, but it is a mix of songs that I have come to love, and new songs that I haven't heard before that I love. The song "No Control" is the best song on the album. I love it. It is a great song and the video is perfect. I think the video alone would make people buy the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like this album. I think it is a great album, but it is still a little too commercial. I think R Kelly tried to go too much of a different route this time. He should have come up with a more different approach, because when you have a lot of the same songs I think the album starts to get repetitive, but this is his first album with new producers and I don't think he knows how to use them. I still wouldn't buy this album when it is on sale, I hope the album is still on sale when I buy the other R Kelly albums because I really like them.

Amazon review: I love this album. It is a great album. I think the beat is outstanding, and I think the songs are great too. I also think the video for the song "I Believe" is excellent.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

###
Amazon review: I'm not going to tell you that there's some sort of hidden message in this album, but there's an obvious message here. For a while now the hip-hop industry has been in a downward spiral.  No one cares about anyone other than the few who they know and the few whom they believe to be their best friends.  It's as if the mainstream hip-hop industry is now just a group of people sitting inside of their little echo chamber, talking and talking about their friends and the friends of their friends.  But no one is really listening to what they are saying, because they are too busy talking about their friends and their friends' friends.  What's worse is that these same people have become so entrenched in the little world of hip-hop that they actually believe their friends and their friends' friends are the best band on the planet.  But this is not a new thing.  There have always been people who think that there's no better band on the planet than their friends and their friends' friends.  It's just that these people don't know better.  This is the problem with hip-hop.  The people who are supposed to be hip-hop's voice of reason are so entrenched in their little world that they think that if the music industry doesn't have the best music, then why should they care.  They think that the best music is whatever their friends and their friends' friends want to play at their parties.  This is the problem with hip-hop.

Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen has recorded two albums that are very good, and yet, I think I would have enjoyed them more if I had not listened to them first.  I think he is one of the most underrated artists.  I don't really think he is that famous.  He does not seem to have the ability to connect with people or to make them feel like they are really with him.  There is something in his music that I find very disconcerting, I don't know if I am crazy or just not getting it.  I think he is one of the most underated artists.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I bought Lifehouse's sophomore album, I was very pleased with it.  This album was the first time I had heard any of their songs together, and I liked them.

Amazon review: The band is back!  They did a great job with this album.  Not only was it a good album, but the album was a complete success.  I really liked "Spin", and I liked "Anchor".

Amazon review: Lifehouse are back with another album.  This is their second.  The first was good, but not fantastic.  A few songs really had a way of sucking the life out of you.  This album seems better, and you'll hear more of the band, but in general, it's not much better or worse than the first album, though "Wasted Times" is a little better.  The band is back on good form.  I don't think I'll be buying this album, but I'll check it out, so I guess it won't be a total loss.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

The songs are very well written and they are very positive.  The lyrics are very positive and uplifting.  The music is very good and it is really a great album.  I really like how the music is written.  It has a very nice melody to it.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of this genre.  I would recommend that this album should be given to a fan of hip-hop.  Of course, I would also recommend this album to everyone else.  The only thing that I would change is that the song "It's Over" should be replaced with "Life is Over".  I think that the song "It's Over" is a little more somber than the original song.  That may be because the original song is about a man who is going to kill himself with a gun, not a girl who is going to kill herself with a gun.  Of course, I didn't listen to this album for that reason.  I listened to this album because I enjoy rap music and I really think that this album is a great album.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I have listened to a number of albums and really liked them all.  However, I have been trying to figure out what kind of music I will have to listen to in the future.  I decided to buy this album because I thought it was like listening to real music.  I do not want to listen to anything different.  I really like the way the music is constructed, where the music changes slightly but the structure of the music stays the same.  I would compare this album to listening to old rock music.  The music is very heavy and very fast.  I would compare this album to listening to rock music from the 70's.  The vocals are very deep and very strong.  There are not as many lyrics as this type of music usually has.  I really like this album.  I have also noticed that the music seems to be very relaxing.  It does not have the same type of music that I usually listen to.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes more old school rock music, especially the 70's.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes heavy music.  I would recommend this album to someone who is concerned about the way they look.  There is a certain type of music that will make you look a certain way.  I would recommend this album to someone who is obsessed with music.  This type of music is very important to me.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of "rock" that is "rock" in the "rock" sense of the term.  This record is "rock" in the "rock" sense of "rock'n roll"...not rock".  The music is so loud, the vocalist is so breathy, there is no melody, and the riffs are so long they would be boring if written down (except the drummers, they are so well played).  This record is "rock" in the "rock" sense of the term-you either love it or you hate it!  The music is loud, but that's what everyone wants to hear, even if it hurts your ears!  The vocals are breathy, but that's what makes the music a "rock" record in the rock sense of the term.  There is no melody, so one can't really appreciate the music anyway.  There is no rythm, so one can't really enjoy the music anyway.  It is just loud rock that is loud rock with a singer that is breathy and that makes it sound like it is on the radio.  If you like the music then you probably like the music.  However, if you love the music then you should hate the music!  Don't buy it!

Amazon review: I've used and reviewed many of the bands that I've reviewed and reviewed so I know what I'm talking about.  This band has a "rock" singer who sounds like a "rock" singer and the instruments play like a "rock" band.  The sound of the guitars, bass, drums, keyboards and vocals are all "rock" sounding.  I don't understand what the big deal is.  I suppose you could say that the "rock" instruments are the "rock" instruments of the band but that's not what I hear.  I don't think that the sounds of the guitars, bass, drums, keyboards and vocals are different than a "standard" "rock" band.  I hear the same things.  They sound like it's not a "rock" band.  They sound like it's more of a "blues" band.  The guitar player plays like a "rock" guitar player and the bass player plays like a "rock" bass player.  The keyboard player plays like a "rock" keyboard player and the drums player plays like a "rock" drummer.  The vocals sound like a "rock" singer and the songs sound like a "rock" song.  They sound like they're trying to sound like a "standard" "rock" band.  They sound like they're trying to sound like a "blues" band.  I think that the people who like that sound are just being overly critical.  I don't think it's a "rock" band.  I think it's a rock "blues" band.  Maybe it should be called "rock "blues" band" because there are "blues" instruments and "rock" instruments and it sounds like it's trying to sound like a "blues" band.  Maybe it should just be called "rock" band.  I don't think it's a "rock" band.

Amazon review: There is no melody to this music.  I love the way the guitar sounds and the drums sound.  It's a "rock" "rock" band.  I listen to a lot of "rock" music and I don't even recognize the sounds of this "rock" band.  The vocals are breathy and they sound like they're in a rock band.  I guess you could say that they are playing rock "classical" music.  I don't think they're playing rock music.  They sound like they're trying to sound like a "standard "rock" band.  They sound like they're trying to sound a "blues" band.  I think they should be called "rock" band.  I think it's a rock "blue" band.  That's what I think.  I'm not a musician.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I was pretty disappointed when I first listened to Keith Sweat and his new CD, 'Crazy' (2004).  I expected to hear more of the mellow singer/songwriter side of him, but instead I was treated to a lot of the guitar playing and 'I'll Be Back' (which I thought was a big mistake). The songs on the CD are definitely good and Keith's voice is still good, but I just didn't hear any of his best stuff.  I guess I just need to re-listen to it a few more times to get an idea of what he's got (or what he doesn't have).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know that I've said this before, but Keith Sweat is an artist and a singer.  He does have some very nice songs, but it's hard for me to appreciate them without hearing them live.  I'm guessing that's not something Keith can do anymore, or maybe it is.  I will admit, his voice and style is pretty good, especially on his new CD.  I didn't hear much of his 'Crazy' CD, but I'm hoping he's up to his old tricks now and can deliver some of the old Keith Sweat that everyone likes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Keith Sweat is a very old soul at 71 years old.  He's the one member of the Fiddlers Four that's still standing strong in the music scene, and has been for almost 60 years.  His style hasn't changed much since I first heard him, and his voice still sounds very good.  I think this CD will be a better listen as the songs are more up to date and with a little more variety to them.  The songs are all excellent, but they don't all have the same feel and vibe that I remember from the old songs.  Some of them are the same songs as well, but there are definitely elements of Keith Sweat in every song.  I don't think I'm at all disappointed with this CD, but I think it's safe to say that it won't be my favorite Keith Sweat CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow, an old Keith Sweat.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad CD, but it was a little disappointing.  The singing is still very nice, but the songs are not up to the standard that I remember.  There is a lot of production value on this CD, but it's not what I like to hear from him.  I was a big fan of Keith Sweat when I was young, and I like to hear him sing his songs.  I was hoping that he would continue to write good songs, but I was a little disappointed.  I guess I'll give this CD a listen and see if it's any good.

Amazon review: Keith Sweats new CD, Crazy, and he's still a great old soul singer.  The only tracks which I enjoyed were 'I'll Be Back' and 'I'm Still Here,'which were both great songs.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

The energy level is there and it is very easy to listen to.  I think that the songs could've been better but as a whole, I really like this album.  It is a great album but it is a long time coming.  It just was not released at the right time for me.  When you're a kid, you can get caught up in the hype and make believe you are a star.  But you should just try to get your album out there and see where it goes.  I was a big fan of the 80's and you could tell that the music was getting better.  But then when you really start digging into the music, you find some amazing artists that are just doing it right.  This was a great album from start to finish.  I'm happy that I got it.

Amazon review: This is a great album!  This artist is so amazing and has done it all.  I just think that this album needs a little more of a follow up.  I was a little disappointed that it came out so late in my life.  I mean, this is a great album but it is a little too late.  I didn't get to see this artist live until 2007 and it was only then that I discovered her talent.  I just don't get a lot of albums coming out in my life that I can recommend or buy.  I think that people who don't buy a lot of music are missing out.  I have been with my family for 15 years and I don't get a lot of music in my life.  I used to think that I would get an album in my life but I haven't and I think that is part of why I only buy music when I really want to, otherwise I get in the way.  This is a great album and I love the sound of it.  I just wish the next one would come out sooner.

I am scared to love someone else because I know how hard it is to be apart from someone you love. I love him and I believe with all my heart we will be together. I feel like I am losing my very important self. I want to be with him and I want him to be with me. But he won't move on. I know he is right, I just don't know how to get him to.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
