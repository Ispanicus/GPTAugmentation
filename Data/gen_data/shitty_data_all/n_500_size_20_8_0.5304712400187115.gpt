Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Its been a while since I have listened to this album, but I must say that I do not care for this album. I found it to be a mixture of the sound of the bands previous albums, and the sound of the band they are now. That is not a good thing, no matter what the genre, and probably the most disappointing thing about this album. Overall, I really do not like this album, and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this cd, the first time I've heard this cd it knocked me out and I listened to it all the way through. I think the cd is great, I'm just not into the band, I have been a fan of the band for awhile but I never got into them as much as I've gotten into other bands like Cold War Kids and The Black Keys.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was introduced to this band when I was looking for something to play during my first college semester. This first album was a solid release for the band, and the next four albums were better versions of the first four. After finishing college my only interaction with this band lasted until I moved to Michigan and started working for the state of Michigan. The band was on a hiatus at that point.

Amazon review: The best album for the band ever. I have heard probably 30 different albums from this band. The only thing I don't like about this cd is the CD booklet says it was released in 2003. I think it should be released in 2003 or 2004, but I am a little bit disapointed that it was released two years later. The CD is very easy to understand, and the lyrics are great. I've always liked this band and this is their best album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've enjoyed the band's work with their two solo albums, their most recent album, and their most recent, "The Unraveling", yet in these other albums, I have felt like I was listening to a different band with the same core members. Maybe it's a lack of new songs, but the older songs that are on this album really are great. The new material is very good as well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really want to like this band, but I've always been disappointed in their music. They've taken great songs and made them better than they ever were on their first albums, which makes it hard to like them. This album is a great listen, but there are only 3 songs here that are good. The rest of the album is just average. Overall, I think this band has improved over the years, but they've always been a disappointment to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is nothing special. Its not bad, its just average. I'd say it's average at best. I only listen to one album from this band each year, and I'd like to listen to this one more than the other two. All three are really good albums, and this one is no exception. The songs are really good, and the lyrics are great. I'm not going to get into the whole band thing, but for the fans of the band, I'd say it's a good album. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it's not a bad album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a bad album, but its not great either. I think it is average. I don't know anything about the band, so I don't know what to expect. I like their first album, and their second one, but I don't like this one at all.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

It's not bad, but it's different, I think. I think it's beautiful but not the song. I don't like it. I don't like the vocals, I don't like the rhythm, I don't like the song. I don't like it.

You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Although it's not really a country album, it does contain a few songs that are country, albeit more in the country blues style.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have never been a huge Death Cab fan, but I love this new song.  Its modern, clean, and just a great song.  If this is any indication of what to expect from their new album, I think its going to be great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I think that this is the first time I've heard this live.  It's not something I would have expected to hear.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever come across a song quite like this on a CD, but this time I had to give it a try.  It's not quite what I was expecting, but when I get past the first few minutes, to my surprise, it's a very nice rendition of the song.  I like it a lot.  I have never really been a huge fan of Korn, but this new song is very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a fun new song.  I'm not a fan of the band, but I would like to be a fan of this song.  It's very short, and I'm not sure how long it takes to get to my point... but it is a very nice song.  I think its length is probably the main reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  I don't quite understand why the song comes in the middle of a song instead of at the end, when that would make the song longer, but anyway.  The song does have a couple of minor problems with the lyrics, but the music is good, and it's a fun song to listen to.  I still like the Korn music, and this is a good song to listen to while waiting for the new music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to admit that I've listened to this on numerous occasions, and yet I have not heard this song before.  I would imagine that a lot of people either did not like this song or did not know it was coming.  I'm not one of those people, and I really enjoyed it.  It's a fun song.  There are a couple of things that I really like about the song.  The first is that this is the first song that I've heard where the main melody is in the background and not the foreground.  I'm not a huge fan of the song, but I do enjoy it and I think it is a really good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is a lot of fun.  I like it.  I haven't listened to Korn in some time, so I'm not sure if I have anything to compare it to, though it is a new song and I did not know it was coming.  I did not know about the new version until I was listening to it, and I really liked it.  I think that it is a bit more up-tempo than the original, but it has a lot of the same good qualities.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song is good!  I like it.  Some of it reminds me of a mix of the original version of "The One" and "The Devil You Know".  It was a good decision to end this song with a bang.  This song just had to come out.  I really like this song.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: While I was waiting on a flight home from an event I had just attended, I listened to this song on repeat. I'm not sure why, but I found it to be a very meaningful song to me. I've been through a lot in the past year. My family is trying to get me back to church; I'm trying to get my personal life together; I'm trying to get healthy. It was a very hard year. But I'm back and I'm good.

Amazon review: You get the first two tracks, "I Will Always Love You" and "The First Time We Met", with a bonus track, "I Believe in You", a Christmas single with a very good vocal group, and the first half of "I Believe in You" is very good, too.

Product Review: I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it's better than I hoped it would be. It's a very good album, as any Gaga album should be. My only problem is that I think she's going to have to tone down her singing a little in the future. I'm not complaining about the songs themselves, but I'm just saying that as a fan of Gaga I might have to temper my enthusiasm a little.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There is not a single bad song on this, which is a good thing. The first song, "A Thousand Years", is a nice Christmas song that doesn't feel fake. It's also the only song on the album I'm not really a fan of. The rest are all very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's so good. I was so excited to get it. As a fan of Gaga, I figured it would be great. But the only thing I can say is that she really needs to tone down the singing. But the songs are great. It's a very good album, worth getting.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the album. My favorite tracks are "Take Me Away" and "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out". I like the song "Take Me Away" a lot because there are different types of music that I like. I don't like a song that has a repetitive verse but this song has a very repetitive chorus. It's like someone is singing a song that sounds like a different song. The song is good but not for me. The song is good, but it is hard to like it. I like songs that have a repetitive verse and a repetitive chorus but that doesn't make my song better. I like this song but that doesn't make it my favorite song. The song is good, but it isn't my favorite song. It's a good song.

Amazon review: This song is great, but nothing great about it. I think the song is good, but it's nothing special. The song is good, but it doesn't stand out. I think of myself as a music person, and I prefer my songs to have a unique sound to them. This song doesn't have a unique sound. It's just a boring song. I mean, it's a song about a girl being beautiful, but this song is about a girl wanting to be a rock star and she's a nerd. Her lyrics are lame and she's boring. I don't like her. She is boring. She has no personality and is a nothing. I like it when my songs have a unique sound to them, and this song is not unique in that way.
