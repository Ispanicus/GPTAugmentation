Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit."  I love it and have used it as my ringtone.  However, I'm not sure if I can get it on my ipad.

Amazon review: I love all of this music.  I like that it is all original.  I have a love/hate relationship with music.  I love the old school stuff like the Beatles.  I hate the current stuff, like rap/hip-hop.  I am a fan of new-wave and synth-pop, like Cyndi Lauper.  I don't really care for the current trend in music that is pop/rock/jazz.  I would love to see someone do a "dance anthem" that has a song that is very rhythm based.  Perhaps, like "The Best of My Love."  Perhaps, I am just being picky but I love it when a song is very danceable.  This song sounds like it has that ability.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It is very catchy and very simple.  I like the song and I like that it is a song.  I like that it has a beat.  I have to say that I am enjoying the song.  What I am not enjoying is that I have to buy it three times a week.  I think it is the song that is annoying the most.  I bought the song and it is on my ipad.  I can't use it to turn the ipad on.  The battery is not turning on.  It does not turn on when I plug it in.  It is stuck on listening.  I think I would buy the songs if I could get my ipad to turn on and work.  It does not seem to be a big deal.  What really annoys me is that it is a song that is on sale.

Amazon review: PASSIONS is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music. I've been a fan of George Skaroulis ever since I stumbled upon him at a Greek Festival some years back. If you love great relaxing piano music along the lines of George Winston or Jim Brickman, you are in for a real treat. I have never been disappointed in this artist's offerings.  Listen to the tracks and find out for yourself, what you've been missing. And then get PASSIONS!

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review: I'm a huge matisyahu follower, and listen to ever other album he has released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like. I'll keep it simple, this is what happens when amazing unique artists go pop and mainstream. I like the song sunshine a lot, but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beats and effects. It's pretty depressing I'm writing this review right now.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never been a huge fan of R&B or hip-hop, but I must say if you listen to it with an open mind, and don't listen to it expecting the usual "Hip-Hop" it can be quite interesting. I think the most interesting parts are the rap songs, where he is trying to be more creative, and the love songs. Very few of his love songs are good.

I really don't like him, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying his music.  It is actually the best album he has released.  I have never been a fan of the singer's music before, but his voice and songs make me want to listen to everything he has released.

Amazon review: I'm still trying to find a copy of this.  It's not on our Christmas play list, probably because I don't know any of the songs.  I don't think it's in any of the music stores.

I listen to his other albums (A Christmas Album, Christmas in Maine, Christmas in Santa Fe, Christmas in the Big City) and they are all good, but this one is the best.

Amazon review: This is my first year buying Christmas albums, and I am glad I started with this one.  I like to listen to Christmas music often, and this is a great album.  The only thing I could think of giving it a lower rating would be the song "Christmas Time is Here", which, while catchy, is very very uninteresting.  At the end of the album there is a song called "Christmas is Here", which I really like.  It is a very good album, and I would recommend this to anyone.  It's not perfect, but it's a good album!

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

Amazon review: George Carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects. He was creative and every time I listened to his other shows, I laughed so hard I had to stop the recording before I choked. His unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made George Carlin stand out from others in his field.  This album is not creative nor funny. It's just hateful. Mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops, fireman and snitches are, as well as fart and enema jokes.

Amazon review: This is the first album by the band that is on the compilation CD that was released with my copy of the LP. I have heard this song on the radio and it always got me excited.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The CD is a beautiful work of art, with a few tracks such as "The Night of the Hunter" and "Lil' Abner" that are so well done they should be the theme for every movie ever made.  The rest of the songs are just average to not so great.  What really stands out is "The Night of the Hunter".  This is a great cover of a great song, and I wish it was kept as the theme song to every movie ever made.  I've seen this movie three times, and each time it leaves me with a new appreciation for the lyrics, the actors, and the actors' directorial skills.  I'm still in love with it.

Amazon review: "The Little Drummer Boy" is one of the most famous songs in the history of music. A song that has not only been played and sung by everyone from Louis Armstrong to Lady Gaga to the Black Eyed Peas, The Beatles to the Rolling Stones to the Animals to the Smashing Pumpkins and many, many other musicians and singers.  The only thing this song doesn't have is a beat.  The Beatles and many other bands have taken "The Little Drummer Boy" and made it into their own songs.  The music on this album would be just as good if the band did that to this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: My brother is a huge George Carlin fan. He is a singer, drummer, and plays the saxophone. He's a fantastic musician and I know he would love this album.

I think he would get the point.

Amazon review: This album has some of the best songs that I have ever heard!  I can't believe that I have never heard any of these songs before.  Not one of these songs is a total dud like the one on the CD, "My Little Girl".  "The Man Who Wasn't There" is a very slow song, but it is a good song.  "I Wish I Was a Mole Rat" is a funny song and I would love to have a friend that would like it. "The New Age" is a great song that would make a great movie, or a great cartoon.  The song "The First Time" is also a great song that would make a great movie, or a great cartoon!  The last song on the album is "Rhinestone Cowboy". This song is a great song that would make a great movie, or a great little cartoon. I really like this song. It is an amazing song that I would like to see in a movie that has a little kid as the main character.  One of the lines in the song goes "And you'll never see me again." This song would also make a great little cartoon.

I would like to see the band put out a compilation CD or two of their greatest hits.  A compilation of songs that they have been putting together and have been putting out on their own.  I would like to see a compilation of the best songs

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: This composition, while ambitious and promising at certain points, never really takes off.  The composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments, but doesn't go anywhere with it.  The themes never develop, and the variations aren't all that different from each other.  I had high hopes for the coda as it seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion, but it was just more of the same.  I do detect some possibilities that his future work may go in some new directions, however.

Amazon review: The track "If I Had a Brain" is an interesting blend of music and words from a book about a woman who is trying to decide between becoming a nun, or dying.  This seems to be an attempt to bring the story to life and create a song that is all about "life" but is also about the idea of the afterlife.  I'm a big fan of the song.  The lyrics are really beautiful.  I really like the word "loved" at the end of the lyrics.  It's a great message.  The music is very well arranged and well produced.  This is a great track.

It's a good song, but not something I like to listen to during the holidays.

Amazon review: I was hoping for something better than this.  I've been reading all the rave reviews and wondering if Amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest. My first impression was, "Sales of the 7 string must be down. time to over use it again."  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Vai.  I do not love Story of Light.  I can't even give a coherent explanation why at this point.  I made it through the first listen and was thankful that I only spent the money on the download.

Amazon review: I am a sucker for Christmas music.  I've been buying this since I found out about it last year.  The best thing about this download is that I'll get it even if I don't have time to listen to it on Christmas Day.  I can wait until Sunday when I'll have time to put it away and listen to it.  For the price, I'm glad I got it.

I listened to the first song and I was not sure if I liked it or not.  When I listened to it second time, I knew it was something special.  The song was very different from the first time.  I really liked the way the song ended.  It was very nice and very emotional.  The lyrics are very meaningful.  I wanted to see the ending.  I wanted to know what happened to the man who was on the boat.  I really wanted to know how it ended.  It was very nice and very touching.  I would recommend this CD to any woman who wants to hear a very special song.  Thank you, Amazon!

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: There were many things that caused me to write this review. I'll start by pointing out that this song was originally written by Jimi Hendrix and performed by a very talented band called the Allman Brothers. The song has a lot of interesting notes that will keep you listening for many years to come. I also would like to point out that this song is very popular in the south and many people don't realize that this song was written by a Jewish guy named Hendrix. I think it is a good song and I hope that it will get the chance to be performed by one of the great band with a great lead singer, but after listening to this song I am not impressed.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Amazon review: First of all, let me start out by saying that while I've been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days, I'm not one of those "classic Chicago" fans who hates the 80s stuff.  In fact, "Chicago 16" is one of my favorite albums by the band.  And "17" is an album that they have every right to be very proud of.  And while "18" and "19" were just cranking-out-the-formula albums for them at that point, they at least had some huge hit singles, which was really all the band was about at that point.

Our tour guide told us that he liked Tumbling Tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song, Tumbling Tumbleweed, over and over! -

Amazon review: I was looking for strictly Disney songs to be played by strings, no singing. The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs "Colors of the Wind", "A Whole New World" and "Beauty and the Beast" all had terrible singers singing along. I don't understand why it is "101 Strings Ochestra" and then singing for a few of the songs. It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental.

Amazon review: I pre ordered this record, so you can imagine the amount of excitement I had when it arrived. I was all but kissed the delivery man when it came! I ran straight up to my record machine and played it, probably around 3 times before giving poor dierks a break. I listened to the record about 5 times after that before the unthinkable happened. "It's different for girls" began to SKIP! I was in shambles! On my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was skipping!

Amazon review: "I like to be on the top of my game." This seems to be the motto of many young people today. They are usually not successful in some areas of life, which prevents them from improving other areas. This song makes me think of the same problem. I think many people fail to follow the path which they have set themselves on and they are not able to grow. This is a very good song and is a good example of how to be self conscious about following your own path.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of a scene in the movie "The Notebook" when Daniel Radcliffe was walking down the street, and he saw a strange man walking on the other side of the street. The man looked like a beggar and was carrying a huge box. The man opened the box, revealing a large amount of money and said to the man, "I am not a beggar, I am a millionaire." The man said, "Well, how do you know?" The man then said, "I don't know, but I know what to do with the money." This shows that one should never be afraid to follow their dreams. If someone really tries their best, they will be successful. This song also reminded me of a book from the Bible called "The Great Divorce" by John Eldredge. The book says that Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem and that the birth was a miracle. In the Bible, the mother of Mary was known as Martha. It is said that Martha could not conceive because she was carrying a child. The Bible also says that Jesus was born in a cave in a village called Bethlehem. The Bible further states that the village was near a cave into which a group of shepherds had been walking. They found the infant Jesus and Jesus said, "I am a shepherd. My flock is the whole world." This suggests that Jesus was not the son of Mary, but of the shepherds. This also shows that even though Jesus is the son of God, he still had to face opposition and resistance. It also shows that when you follow your heart, you will succeed.

Amazon review: I got to this song during the week of my birthday because I really wanted to sing it. I went to my local library and found the song in the "Gospel Choir Collection" and I loved it.

A:

I am guessing that you have the file name/path being too long.
When you open a file with a short filename or path, it is expected that Windows Media Player will display the file contents.
So when you open the file with the long filename or path, it is likely that Windows Media Player is displaying a message asking you to change the filename/path to be more manageable.
It's not really possible for you to change the filename/path to be more manageable as it is the long filename that is being shown.

 

A:

The problem is caused by the file name/path being too long. Try to edit the file name or path and it should work. If it still doesn't work then you could try and open the file with WinAmp and then open it in WMP.

 

A:

I had this exact problem.
I was able to fix it by opening the file with the long file name and then opening it in a text editor.
Here's what I did:

Open the file in Notepad++
Go to the end of the file, and delete everything.
Save the file as the short file name (not the long one)
Open the file in WinAmp

 
After following this step, the file opened in WinAmp and played without any problems.

 
I hope this helps.

 

 

 

 

 
I am now able to listen to the song without any problems.

In short, and for not doing more blood, this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

I'm very proud of "Glow," and I think it's one of the best songs I've ever written. It was a learning experience for me, having to get used to the constant feedback from a live band.

Amazon review: "The first time I played "Flesh and Blood" on stage was in May of 1993, at the U-Haul Theater in Berkeley.  It was a disaster.  The audience was about fifteen people, and we were playing at midnight.  I tried to sing on the spot, and I kept getting stuck between verses.  The bass player, who was playing rhythm on the piano, stopped playing and just sat there with his eyes closed.  He just kept playing, no matter what I did.  I think he thought I was in rehearsal.  I had a lot of nerves, but I knew this was my last chance to play this song live.  It was a terrible night.  I played the songs I knew I could play, and I played "Flesh and Blood" for the first time in years.  Now, I've been waiting for this song for so long, and I'm really nervous to play it."

Amazon review: "I wrote this song because I was sick of people telling me that I had no talent.  I had no ambition, and I didn't care.

It's about the person who has the courage to follow your passion and not let the world tell you that you're not good enough.  I have learned that the most important thing in life is a good friend.  I've also realised that, by following your passion, you help everyone around you.  Thank you."

Amazon review: It's been a while since i've really listened to Tegan and Sara, but when in heard "I Couldn't Be Your Friend" I immediately had to buy the album. I'm so glad I did because I had forgotten how much I loved them! I love this album - it's a bit different than what their old stuff was like, but it's still awesome!

Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.

Amazon review: I've seen you in here before, but I don't remember you posting. This is a good album that comes from my childhood. I think I bought it in the 80's. I bought the new CD's when they came out. My mom had a cassette of them and I bought it. I didn't like the first CD, but then I liked the second CD and bought all of them. Love them!

Amazon review: This is a song that speaks to me. It is a song that has a lot of life in it. I feel like this song is a part of my life. It is always a part of my life and I have never been able to put it out of my mind. I have listened to this song and heard it every day for the past few years. The song is about how much I love my family and how I always do what is best for me.

Amazon review: When I was a kid my mom used to play this song and would sing it to me. It's a good song and it really tells the story of how the song started. The only thing I would like to change is the chorus. The chorus says "I'm so happy", but I don't think it's really happy. It's more like it's saying: "I'm not happy, I'm not happy, I'm not happy" It's a little disappointing because it's a little different from the rest of the song. The song is about someone who finds love, I guess. It's a good song, but I would like it to be a little bit different than what it is. I would like it to be just a little bit more, well, more happy.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like this song. The song takes place in a world where the sun shines every day. I like that it sounds like it was a lullaby. I am not a big fan of lullabies, but I guess that works for me. I like that the song is not full of lyrics and the one that comes to my mind first is "How can you be so cold?" I like that the song has an upbeat feel to it. It's like the song is saying, "look around, everything is beautiful" and then the last line is "I'm so happy". I like the sound of the music. It has a very nice sound to it. I like the melody in the song and I like the way that the song has a very upbeat feel to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good song. I'm not a fan of the lyrics, but I like the way that the song is sung. The song is about finding love. I like the way that the song has a very upbeat feel to it, and I like the melody in the song. The song is about finding love and having a good time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song is about the last moments of someone's life. I just really liked the song and thought it was very good. I don't know why, but I really loved the song.

Amazon review: This is about being in love. I like the way that the song has a very upbeat feel. It starts out with a nice sound. I like that the song has a very upbeat feel to it. I like that the song has a very upbeat feel to it. It tells the story of someone. He is feeling lonely. He sees a guy and falls in love with him. The guy is the guy that you see a lot, and you know that the guy likes you. The guy is kind of a jerk, a jerk that likes to tease the people who are around him. The last line of the song is "I'm so happy". I like the way that the song has a very upbeat feel to it and I like the melody in the song too. I like the last line of the song too. I like that it tells the story about someone who loves someone and is happy.

Amazon review: A great follow-up to her award winning duet with Jason Aldean and her TV show "Duets," Kelly sings with famed country artist Vince Gill to create a truly lovely song.

Amazon review: I guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy. I think I was spoiled on the old Chicago. Kind of like the 72/73 Miami Dolphins. I expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another Super Bowl. Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review: This is the fifth album by Missy Higgins.  If you love Kelly Clarkson and want to dig deep into her music, this is a great listen.  She was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Country Album.  I have heard many people say "she has a lot in her."  I totally agree.  I am not going to say much about it, except to say that I am glad Kelly and her team are still working to keep her fans happy and to bring new fans into her music.  I have bought all of her albums, but this one is the best.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think the only reason I didn't get this album was because I had heard some of it before, and I didn't think I would like it.  I listened to the album again and I really enjoy it and it is one of my favorites of her albums.  This is a really good album and I recommend it to everyone.  It is just that she is back with a really good album and this one doesn't have the same kind of quality as her previous albums.  If you want to listen to a Kelly Clarkson album that you can also play on the piano or guitar, her this one is it.

Amazon review: I first heard this album when I was 8 years old.  I had to buy it to have it on my phone and I loved it.  I think the message she is trying to get across is a positive one. It is a really good album.  I guess I am just someone who likes to get music for free.  I just love music and I love singing.  I can definitely see where her fans are coming from.  I have been listening to her ever since I was a little kid.  I love listening to her new album and she is just a great singer.  I am glad I listened to this album when I was younger.  I think that she has a great future ahead of her.

Amazon review: I love Kelly Clarkson but her albums have become more and more commercial, especially on this one.  I think her voice is beautiful, but I think she has lost a lot of her ability to sing country.  I think this album is great.  I wish she released more music.  I really like this album and I wish more music came out of her albums.  It is really just a different song, but I think it is really good.

I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image. I find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc.

Amazon review: I had hopes of nice old style quality Christmas hymns and songs from Guidepost vinyl albums we have.  Not so.  This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.

If you want to experiment it might be worth the money, but if you are looking for some uplifting Christmas music I would not recommend this.

Amazon review: This is an original indie rock CD with the music of one of my favorite bands in my opinion.  However, I really don't like it.  The guitar sounds like a synthesizer.  The vocals are very annoying and the lyrics are the worst.  It is a fun CD with a few good songs and a bad one.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.
