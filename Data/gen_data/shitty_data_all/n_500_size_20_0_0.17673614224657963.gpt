Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

There were very few songs that I felt were completely original, and I didn't get the feeling that they were taken from any other artists.

I was hoping it would be more like "I'm Not Going To Rehab, (No, no, no,.)"

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A couple of hours in the car with my husband and I came up with this playlist after listening to this album in our car (driving to our cottage).  I love the way it makes me feel.  There's a lot of 'I love you's' and 'I wish you were here' in there, but they're all there to really make you feel it.  There's not a song that I don't like.  All of the songs are pretty good, too, not the best, but certainly not the worst.  I'm a little disappointed that they've released an extended version instead of a single, but I don't know if I would have liked it as much if I had more single versions to choose from.  The song "Your Love" is probably the best song on the album, but I do have the extended version on iTunes.  I'd say it's a little better than the single, but it's not a huge improvement.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I didn't think I'd be into a lot of the songs on this album, but I fell in love with "In My Dreams" (which is the title track) and listened to it over and over.  I love this album, but there's a lot more that I love.  The song "Our Love" (in particular) just blew me away.  I didn't expect to be so moved by this song.  It's got such heart-wrenching lyrics and such a great melody, and it really hits home.  I also love "Our Love" in particular, and the other tracks on this album.  I really enjoyed it, and I think it's great that they took a more melodic approach.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a beautiful song.  I've always thought it was a beautiful song.  I have a feeling that if a woman were to listen to the lyrics about "a man he loved" and "a woman he loved," she would be drawn to the man, but not the woman.  I think this is a great song, but I don't think this is the most beautiful song.  I'm not saying that it's horrible, but it's not the most beautiful song.  I think if you really like this song, then you'll probably like the video.  The only thing I don't like about the video is the music.  All of the music is really good, but a lot of the songs are just okay.  The song is just okay.  I was really hoping that if you really like this song that you would like the video.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song.  In fact, I was hoping that with the new single, "Your Love," that it would be released as an exclusive single.  I know it's not the most beautiful song, but I just love the song.  I also really enjoyed the video.  I don't know if I would recommend this song to everyone, but I do think it's very good.  I would say that if you're a fan of the song/video, then you'll probably like this album.  But if you're not a fan of the song/video, then you won't be interested in this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the second-to-last song from the album.  I really wasn't expecting to like it.  After listening to it, I found it to be a really good song.  I actually don't really like the last song on the album, "Our Love."  I just don't really like the sound of it.  I like the other songs that were released on the album better.  I think the best song on the album is probably "In My Dreams."  It's just so special that I can't really give it a negative.  I think the only thing that I would say is that I would be happy if they put out a single on this album that is just the same as the version on the single "Your Love."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know how to really explain this.  The song is good.  The video was good.  The band is good.  But this is the first time that I've seen the band perform live, and I wasn't quite expecting them to do the song exactly the same as they did on the video.  But, I was really looking forward to listening to it because it reminded me of some of the bands that I grew up listening to.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I wouldn't say that the video is bad, but the song itself is just okay.  But the song isn't really the problem.  The song is the problem.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I was not surprised by the fact that the songs were sung by a guy in a black suit.  I'm not sure if he's a comedian or a singer or both.  I'm sure they all know each other.  They all have the same voice.  And the same delivery, which I found to be mediocre.  At least one person can play the piano, but they all sound like they're singing in a low range of piano notes.  They do not seem to be particularly talented at playing songs.

So it's not a Christmas album, it's a compilation of Christmas songs.

But I never liked this album.  It's just another Christmas album.  It's not Christmas music.  It's Christmas songs.  It's just Christmas songs.  It's not very Christmassy, it's very generic.  The songs are just there because they are Christmas songs.  But the music is not very good.  For example, I'm not a fan of Christmas carols because I consider them to be over the top and overly melodic.  But this guy does them very well.  The music is very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

"This is the best album of the 2000's. I love the production and the lyrics. And I'm glad they did not try to imitate the Chronic or 2001 albums - they did not have anything great, just a lot of good songs."

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like everything about "Sunshine"..except the song "Sunshine", I thought it was just another "hit" on this CD, but it wasn't, the reason why I gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5, is that I thought the "Sunshine" was the last song on the CD and was just an add-on, but it was actually the 1st song on the CD and I like it, it's a great song..

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the band and this CD in particular I listen to it often.  I have to say I have to be honest when I say I did not expect the album to be so good. In my opinion I expected the album to be more of a hit. When I listen to this CD it reminds me of Rascal Flatts, but the sound more so than Rascal Flatts. The band are really good at writing and producing songs. The best thing about the CDs is the song "Sunshine"  the song is so catchy and really good to dance to. I find myself singing along to it when I am out and about.

Amazon review:  I got this album in the mail the other day and the first song I heard was "Sunshine"  I had to listen to it a few times to get the song but once I got it I was hooked, I have been listening to it while I am at work and I just can't get enough of it.  I love the song and the album as a whole. Its a catchy catchy song.  The album is really good and I can't wait for the next album.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: All I can say is how could any one not like this album!  It has awesome musicianship, great sound quality and is well produced.  I have been listening to these guys for years and I am not disappointed.  I am so glad the guys are doing this.  What a great way to get to know each other.  It's like we are all in this band together.  One of my favorite albums.

Amazon review: I bought this album a little over a week ago.  I have to say that I am not dissapointed.  The songs are very well put together and the band sounds great.  I have a couple of songs that I had not heard yet.  I could listen to this album all day and night.  I had heard other albums by the band before this one and I will say that it is a little different from the others.  It is a little more country with a little more rock and roll in the mix.  For these reasons I really enjoy this album.  I may even buy this album again in the future.  The only complaint I have is that the songs are slightly repetitive.  I would have to say that this is not a bad album.  I just felt that it was somewhat lacking.  I am glad that the band is going to continue to play live and I wish them the best of luck.  I love their brand of country music.  All of the songs are very well put together.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know how this band can have any other opinion than they are great.  I've had the album for a month now and I just can't stop listening to it.  Not only is the music great but the band is great.  This is a band that you could not be in without all of their amazing talent.  I can't wait to hear what they have in store for us.  Love this band!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The album is great, but I really like the sound of it much more than the music.  It really sounds like it's the same band with a different lead singer.  I like the music and that's why I like the album.  The only thing it's lacking is a better lead singer.  I mean that's like expecting anyone to be able to make a hit song from their first try.  I would have to say that it has a bit of a short life span.  Although the songs are well written and they are great musicians, I think they would have been better off going back to the basics of country.  They don't play great country music and they don't play great songs, but I don't think they are great musicians.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was born and raised in Nashville, TN, and have been a huge fan of the Zac Brown Band since I first heard their hit song entitled "Country Music" over 10 years ago.  This album is my first Zac Brown Band album, and I was really excited to get the chance to listen to it.  I was not disappointed.  The music is great, and the musicianship is amazing.  The songs are well written, and the lead singer has a great voice!  I was most impressed with the sound quality, as this is a very clear album with a great mix.  I can't wait to purchase the next Zac Brown Band album.  I wish them the best of luck in the future.  I love this band!

Highly recommend this album.
