Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Bjork - The Voice of Love - Amazon Music Awards

published: 06 Feb 2015

I'm a singer/songwriter with an amazing voice and I wrote this song for the first time. It's about the inspiration that inspires me. The first time I heard Bjork sing the title of this song, I was mesmerized. I have to thank her for giving me the opportunity to sing this song. It was a very difficult task to sing and I'm glad that I managed to do it well.
This is the first time that I've ever collaborated with an artist and I'm incredibly happy to say that I'm very happy with the results. It was a very difficult task to write this song and I'm also very happy for all the people involved. Bjork is very passionate about singing. I felt very inspired by her lyrics. I hope that you enjoy the song.
This song is dedicated to the people who inspire me, my friends, family and fans.
Thank you.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: If you think you can listen to a album called  The Legend Of The Mountain Man in your car then you have no idea what a real band is.  This album will take you on a journey through the past and the future.  It is a musical journey through the life of a Mountain Man and through his family.  Even though the album is about his family, it's a family that has existed since time immemorial.  His family, which consists of his wife, children, and grandchildren, have all lived in the mountains.  They have a culture that is very unique, and have never had anyone tell them what to do, or where they should go.  The music on this album is just amazing.  There are so many different styles that the listeners can fall in love with the music.  The music speaks of the mountains of the past and the mountains of the future.  The music is so beautiful and so unique that it can be enjoyed by anyone.  But most of all - it is just a great album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  I don't know what it is that makes all of the composers sound so good, but all of them are very accessible. The music is lively, and I love the way they all have that "wow" factor. The CD has a nice and upbeat feel, with a nice blend of acoustic and electric instruments.  It is easy to get lost in the music. The musicians are very good, and there are no bad performances, just a few that could use more experience.

Amazon review: There are only two things in this CD. The first is the CD itself, which is simple, but has a great feel. There are two songs on the CD that I listened to repeatedly, and they are the only two songs that stand out for me. They are entitled: "The Great Divide" and "Myself". I liked both, and I would recommend these two songs for everyone.

Amazon description:  At the beginning of the 21st century, one of the world's greatest composers, Carl Orff, was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He had to resign from his position as principal of the New England Conservatory.  For the first time in his professional life, he devoted himself to composition, producing a CD of his works, which was released on July 13, 2001.  The CD includes the composer's most important works, including the famous "Carillon" for soprano and orchestra, and the world premiere of "Carillon No. 2" for flute and orchestra, which was performed on December 11, 2000, in Carnegie Hall, with soloist Judith Blegen.  The CD had a limited distribution of only 20,000 copies, sold exclusively at the New England Conservatory's annual subscription concert, and is now out of print.  The CD was not available for purchase from the composer's Web site.  The CD is now available at Amazon with a suggested price of $7.29.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know the song was not written by Phil Collins and it's not a good song, but  I can't help it. I can't listen to any more of the new stuff by Phil Collins. He just gets on my nerves and makes me want to punch him in the face. I was glad I didn't pick up anything by Kiko.  Phil's voice is just a little too nasal for me. And don't get me started on the new stuff by Paul McCartney (which I loved when I first heard it) or anything by Paul Anka and Billy Joel. I was glad I didn't buy their new stuff either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I got to hear these guys for the first time on the radio and they were great! I listened to their album "The Real Thing" because I enjoy the song "My Girl" and I want to hear more of their music. I have to admit I thought they sounded a little bit like The Band before I heard them.  But then I heard the song "Who's Got Your Back" and I thought, "Oh shit, that's Phil Collins." I'm still not sure what he's singing about.  I have not heard the rest of the album yet.  It doesn't really sound like Phil Collins.  And it's not very good.  I don't know what happened to the band. The new stuff by Paul McCartney is pretty good though.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Phil Collins since he was first in the group.  The band Phil Collins was suppose to be in,  The Rumour, broke up after only 7 years so I had no choice but to continue my love for Phil Collins.  I first heard his version of "The Long and Winding Road" when I was about 10 years old.  It was one of the first songs that  I knew the words to and I have been listening to it every since.  I have had this cd for a long time and at first I thought it was a great cd but I was very disappointed in the material.  I am glad I got it as the cd was  worth it. If you haven't heard it yet,  I recommend you to download it.

Amazon review: I heard this when I was a kid and had no clue  what the hell I was listening to.  I just thought it was a great song and I was glad I had it as I was a fan of Phil Collins.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I first heard Phil Collins after hearing "Breathe Again"  on a radio station.  I listened to "Breathe Again" for a long time and I thought,  "What the hell is this guy singing about?"  I liked a lot of his songs but "Breathe Again" was the only one that really made  me say, "Wow what the hell is this guy singing about?"  It was the song that made me realize that Phil Collins was in fact  a great musician.  I was in high school at the time and the first time I heard this song I didn't know what to think.  The song "Here Comes the Sun" was the next song that made me realize that  Phil Collins was great.  I went to my first concert that I ever heard him perform.  I couldn't believe that I was  seeing him.  I was in 10th grade at the time.

Amazon review: I have heard about this song since I was in the 6th grade.  It's a song that I thought was cool but  when I listen to it now I find it really annoying and very annoying at the same time.  It's a very annoying song to listen to.  The song doesn't have anything  special about it.  It's not a great song.

The first disc is great, and was a big part of the soundtrack for the movie. The second disc is the worst. This recording sounds like it was recorded in a hurry and I can't help but wonder if it was recorded by a novice, which is ridiculous considering how good it is. The worst part is the song "I want it now", which is annoying and makes the entire album sound like the same two songs played back to back. Really, don't waste your time and money buying this album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is a singer who will get you screaming, crying, or jumping off your seat. Her voice is soft and sweet, and she does not have the voice to belt a tune from the hip. She will take your heart away in a single song, but you will want to hear her voice over and over again.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love Meghan Trainor.  I don't know why.  I love her voice, but I don't really understand her.  I think because she's from Texas and I'm from New York City.  Maybe she's a Texan and I'm from New York.  I don't really know.  I've tried to get her to be honest about her family and they turn out to be a bunch of assholes.  She's so good and kind of an outcast.  And I totally understand if you don't like her music because she's really different from other artists.  I just think she's an incredible artist and I want to like her more than I do.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love my Meghan Trainor.  I think she's great.  She's an amazing singer.  She's not at all annoying like a lot of other artists that make pop music that I've listened to.  I don't know what the big deal is.  She's a great artist.  I love her voice and I've been listening to her music since she was a child.  That's pretty cool.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album is a great collection of original material and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to a wonderful collection of original music.  It has a great mix of new original songs and some of my favorite tracks from the recent Libera recordings.    The only problem with the album is that it seems to be the same song over and over again, not a single person can stand to hear the same song a second time.  It's just not the same.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've only listened to a portion of the CD.  I find the piano music to be very nice and the singing to be great.  There are some decent songs on this CD that I would like to hear more of.    I am not a fan of the use of drums, but the vocals are so good that I can't complain.  I have heard that it has some songs that use the same style of singing.  I would like to hear these songs more than once to see if they are really the same song several times.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I wanted to check out Libera without having to pay the full price.  I was a little disappointed in the album, but still a good purchase.  I do wish that there would have been a few more songs on this album that I really liked.  I would have liked to hear more of the songs that were on the CD I had previously had.  The album would have been complete if it didn't include some really boring songs.    The songs on this album are very good and would recommend it to people who enjoy a good music selection.  The songs are not as good as other artists, but they are good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the CD because I saw a review on Amazon and decided to check it out.  This is a very different CD from the one I'd been hearing on my radio before.  It has a very different sound.  The best song on this album is "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square".  I can't wait to hear more of this album.    The other songs are good, but I don't think I would listen to them in a live setting.  I wouldn't want to be behind the piano all night.  The piano keys are hard and the sound is very clear, but the playing is not very good.  The songs are very short and the quality of the songs are not very good.  I think that I would prefer having a CD with more songs that are a little longer.  The songs on the album are okay.  In the past, I've listened to this album before and I liked it, but it's a little long for what I consider to be a short CD.

Amazon review: I bought The Libera CD from a friend and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  The CD is excellent!  I enjoyed listening to it on a CD player and now that I have it on my iPod, I enjoy listening to it on my walky talky.  I love the album!  The CD is a great variety of Libera's songs.  One of the best albums I have ever purchased.  I love the music and I love the CD.  I purchased two more albums from this CD.  I love them both!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Lately, I've been finding it incredibly hard to find anything that will make me sit down and listen to this album. I have a lot of other things to listen to besides music, and listening to music is one of those things. This album is a lifesaver.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

They have a good sound and they have really good musicians.  I like the way they play. They play to the crowd.  They don't play for the crowd.  They play to each other. I like the way they sound and how they play.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves good music. I also recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good band.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
