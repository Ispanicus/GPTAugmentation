Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: You either get it or you don't. But if you do get it then you will love it. Unique, spacey, cosmic, trippy, technical and melodic. Overall it's a great solid album. recommended to fans of voivod, toxik, watchtower, rush, vector, atheist, cynic or any other technical/prog band

Amazon review: No, this is not another "I've been a fan of Lucinda since. this or that record.(usually "Wheels on a gravel road", which everyone seems to worship) and I was really so disappointed because she a) mumbles  b) slurs or c) isn't as good as she was on "Car wheels.  True, I've always liked Lucinda.  In a world of boy bands and shallow pop music she's been a constant factor, not always brilliant, but always heartfelt and sincere, providing a steady stream of decent albums in the borderland between country, blues and rock.

Amazon review: Lucinda and the Dukes.

Amazon review: I'll admit, I've never been a fan of Lucinda, she's never really clicked with me.  But this album has me very much on board.  This is actually the first time I've heard her sing live in years.  This is one of the best live albums I've ever heard.  Very much worth the price of admission.  The first track, "No More Tears" is one of my all time favorites.  This is definitely the most accessible album Lucinda has ever released.  "No More Tears" is a classic, it's the first and only time I've heard her sing a song of this length and it was a lot of fun hearing her sing it again.  I love the second track, "One Way Street" because I can hear the song in her voice, the same way I can hear a song in my own voice.  I don't always like Lucinda's voice, but I love the songs she sings.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Lucinda and the Dukes.  I heard this album a few years ago and I loved it.  I love her vocal style here.  There are a lot of country songs on here, but they are very well sung.  The best one I think is "Mister Fingers" because she sings it in a way that reminds me of Little Big Town's voice.  I actually think this is the best album Lucinda has ever released.  If you like Lucinda, you'll like this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Lucinda.  I am not into Lucinda's music, but I really enjoy this album.  The songs are well written, the vocals are good and the album is very good.  I am not sure why I like this album so much, but I do.  Lucinda's voice is very nice and she sings with a lot of emotion.  I believe that her voice has improved a lot since she released her first album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: One of the best Lucinda albums ever.  I like Lucinda's voice, but I like her album better.  I would say, in my opinion, the best album she has released.  This album has a lot of emotion in every song.  The way she sings "I wanna tell you it's so hard it hurts to think about you" is beautiful.  Her voice is very unique and the songs are very good.  I don't know why I like Lucinda so much, but I do.  She's just a beautiful person.

Amazon review: I've listened to several of her albums and this one is the best.  This album is very well produced and has a lot of emotion in every song.  The song "I've seen the best of the best" is one of my favorite.  If you like Lucinda, then this is a must buy for you.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

The only time I've listened to this (and I've listened to it for years) is when I need a pick-me-up when I'm having a bad day. The song has a unique melody and I love the lyrics.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Lately I've been listening to a lot of electronic music from electronic music."  That's a pretty big statement, but he's right- this is definitely a lot more in the electronic direction than many other bands you'll find.  It has more of an electronic element than most other albums that I've heard recently.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow.  I love this album.  Not only because the lyrics are so good, but also because the songs are quite melodic.  I had the same reaction to this album that I did to the Clapton live album- I was a bit disappointed that a lot of the songs weren't as good live.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this album.  I've listened to it a few times and I really like it.  It is a great combination of several different styles and they can all be heard in one listen.  "Shameless" is a great example of a song which has both a rock and an electronic vibe.  "Falling" is really heavy yet still very soothing and "I Wish" is a great song which has a lot of different styles in it.  It's also one of the only few albums which I've really loved throughout the entire year.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a bit confused by the review.  I think it's a little ironic that someone who does not like '70s music should have loved this album.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

The bass is a bit higher than normal, but not too high to be distracting.  The guitar sound is a little louder than normal, but not so loud that it makes the song too hard to hear.  The third track "I'm on My Way" is a beautiful ballad that contains some good vocals, and is a bit of a departure for Vitas.  It's slower, and the guitar sound is a little more subdued.  The fourth track "I'm on My Way" is a lovely ballad that contains some good vocals, and is a little bit slower than the previous album, I do like the music, but I think it is a boring CD, and I do not like the lyrics.

You are missing out if you aren't a fan of dylan's music. I'm sure he is an excellent musician, but the man's greatest passion is his music and I like it!

In fact, I liked the song very much. The lyrics were a little confusing to me, but the tune is very good. It had a great melody and I liked the way the song ended. I don't think the lyric would be that good if I had had time to read the lyrics with the melody in mind.

It is a very good song and I definitely will be purchasing it.

This song is so bad, it has no redeeming qualities. It was boring, repetitive and annoying. I do not understand why this song was written. I don't know what they could have possibly done to turn out such an awful song.

The song sounds like the producers made a parody of Bon Jovi's "Goodnight." It's actually not bad, just like the song, it's very simple and catchy.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.

Amazon review: Lee Morgan, quit Mastbaum Tech in Philly and went on the road, and then rethought his decision and enrolled at Julliard for a year. When he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling. The brilliance of his tone is there, but his ideas have not yet been fully developed. Plus, Cliff Jordan's playing, the senior side man on this cut leaves a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to.

Amazon review: Allright - I listened to this CD a couple of times and I think I am going to buy it. The first time I listened to it I thought maybe this is an old record and it just has that "sound" that you find in a lot of old recordings. But when I listened to it a second time - it just kept getting better. I think this is a really good CD. I am not sure how much I like some of the other tracks. I think there is some good, but not great, material. I think there is a lot of energy in this CD. The only thing I would say about it is that I think it could have been better. Maybe it was not recorded as well as it could have been - and it seems like the more you play it the more you hear this. Also, I think there are a lot of songs that you don't really hear until you get to the end. But, that is not a bad thing. I think this CD is really good and I will probably buy it. Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album, as I have already stated, is very good. This is a CD that will be listened to quite a bit. The first track, "A Man Called God," is definitely one of the best tracks of the album. The first two tracks, "Not a Pretty Girl" and "A Man Called God," are both excellent as well. I have noticed that when I was listening to this CD, it was a lot better when I was listening to it on the radio. I can't recommend this album enough. There is a long way to go before you can call this CD complete, but if you are like me you will love it anyway. Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

Prince is one of my favorite artists.  I'm a fan of all of his music.  He's one of my favorite singers, and as someone who's into a lot of different types of music, I tend to really like Prince songs.  The music is very melodic, and the words are usually very poetic.  I've never really liked the lyrics on any other Prince songs, but on this particular one, I really like them, and they're even more profound than the words in the song 'Forever Changes.'  The song is all about love and loss, and it's so beautiful to listen to, especially on a rainy day or when you're feeling down.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music was a nice change from the "rock" and "rap" type of music that I usually listen to.  Prince's music is my favorite by far, and I don't really have any bad reviews for his songs.  His songs are beautiful, often very moving, and always feel very personal.  If you listen to any of his songs, you'll realize that he is one of the greatest lyricists of all time, and his songs are very deep.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Heart since "Diamonds are Forever" was released on VHS in 1980. Since then, I can think of very few artists who have written better music. They're not afraid to take risks and do things their own way - with very few compromises. The songs are just so good that it hurts to hear them. And the harmonies are gorgeous.

Amazon review: This album is amazing. The album is just fantastic. The album is like a roller coaster. You can't really stop the music or the emotions. I've always been a fan of Heart & their music. I love the harmonies on this album. I'm a fan of most artists that sing harmonies, but I have to say that Heart has the best harmonies. There are some songs on this album that you'll have to sit down and really listen to and then there are others that you'll just have to "sing along" with to really appreciate them. I love this album.

Amazon review: The first LP of heart's greatest hits (not that there's any doubt at all) was the best thing they ever did, imo, and I'll stick with it for the rest of my life. They were never afraid to experiment or take chances or try it all. The songs are amazing, and I always thought of them as being as good as they are now. The first cd was the best, but the second cd made me miss the first one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always loved Heart. They are my favorite pop group and always have been. They were one of the first groups I was REALLY into because when I was a kid I would listen to my brother listen to songs instead of playing them on the stereo. Since then I've been hooked on Heart. I can't believe how many years I've been a fan of the group. I got hooked on this album because of the harmonies and I'm so happy that they chose to go with a different producer on this album. I don't think they were afraid to try something new, but I can't say the same thing about the album as a whole. I'm surprised that the first album was so good, and then this album is so disappointing. I can understand why they went with a different producer. I just wish they would've went back to working with the same producers.

Amazon review: This is an awesome cd.  It's worth the money and I recommend it.  I think they should have released an album with all their songs that are similar-I mean songs that are similar in tempo, lyrics, instrumentation, etc..  I've only listened to two tracks-but I hear a lot of them.  I'm glad they did it-but I think it would have been better if they had released a full album of all their other cd's.  I loved this CD.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

Just put this on your iPod instead, because you'll never have to hear this again.  A better version of "Dark Side of the Moon" might exist, but this isn't it.  If you want to have a good Floyd album, you'll have to get a copy of "Wish You Were Here."  Now try to make that album.

They did 'Eleanor Rigby' and 'Rubber Soul' and 'Rubber Soul'.  They did 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band' and 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band'.  Now they made a CD called "Abbey Road" with "The Beatles" on it.  It's a joke, because it's crap.  It's a ripoff of the Beatles, it's a ripoff of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", it's a ripoff of "I Want to Hold Your hand", it's a ripoff of "Help", it's a ripoff of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and it's a ripoff of "Help"!

In a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver, hats off to Shinedown for coming through in a major way!

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

This review is from: Sarah McLachlan: In the Blink of an Eye (CD)

I bought this album a couple of days ago, and have been playing it over and over again trying to figure out the lyrics. The lyrics are not easy to get into, and I can't figure out what the heck the song is about. I didn't get this album when it first came out, but when I saw it was available on Amazon again, I bought it.

I am a huge fan of the woman, and I've been a Sarah McLachlan fan since I heard "Crazy Love" on MTV in 1988. The last time I saw her in concert, she was singing "
