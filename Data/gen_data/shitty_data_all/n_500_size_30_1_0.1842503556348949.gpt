Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is a disc that I purchased some time ago and has been sitting on a shelf ever since.  It is one of the lesser known gems of the '90s.  I was able to obtain a copy of it through a friend.  There are a couple of songs that I do remember liking at the time but I am not sure that I am remembering them correctly.  There are many great songs on this CD, but those that I can remember most vividly were:
* "The Rodeo Queen" - This song is a little over half way through the CD.  It is a great song which I think has been on the radio quite a bit recently.  It is very popular with young people.  The guitar solo (which is played by Jonny Lang) is great.  I remember thinking that Lang might be very talented.
* "Redneck" - I can't really remember the lyrics much, but I remember this one was a little over an hour or so into the CD.  I remember thinking it had a great groove.
* "Jungle Love" - This song is about a love affair between a boy and a girl.  I think this song is about a boy who was "too good" for his mother and his father.  I think the boy is a jock and the girl is a hippy.  The song is about the boy's disappointment in his life and the girl's hopes for the future.
* "Blue Highways" - This song is about a person who lives by the highway.  I think it is about a person who is very self-centered.  The song was one of the few I could really remember, but this being a live recording, I think there are some mistakes here and there.  I can't really say what they are.  I think that one of the mistakes (I can't remember which) was the last line of the song which was:

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: My favorite album of all time, and I have been a long time fan of Keith Green. I was very disappointed when I heard this album was being released on CD. I had already purchased the CD of The Definitive Collection and the only reason I bought this CD was for the bonus CD. When I got the CD, I was disappointed. I really liked the album, but I didn't think it was worth the money. I purchased the CD anyway thinking that I would listen to it. I don't think I will purchase any more Keith Green albums.

Amazon review: This is pretty much a Keith Green compilation CD. I don't think it is worth anything more than $7.00. Some of the songs are not very good. I still have a lot more to listen to, so I am still looking forward to listening to it. I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: I love Keith Green, so I was very happy to find out about this album. I wish they would have released it on CD or at least on an LP album. I wish they would have released it on CD at a reasonable price. I wish they would have packaged it with one of the other albums in this collection. I think they should have done a two disc set, so people could purchase the two CD albums. They should have packaged this with "The Definitive Collection". I wish they would have released this CD as a two disc set. If they had done this, maybe I would have purchased this CD. I don't think it is worth anything more than $7, but I am looking forward to listening to it. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

I would have liked to hear a new song from her, but I don't think I've ever heard a new song by Jewel.  There are some nice touches in the music, but there are also a lot of things that make me want to put the needle back in the record player and get on with the story.  I've said here and there that I love Jewel's music.  It is true.  But I can't stand it any more.  I love her music, but I don't love this band.  It's a shame, because this is actually a good CD.  It's a good album.  I don't know what she does.  She seems to have trouble with her own music, which is sad.  I don't know what else to say.  I LOVE her music.  I just don't love this album.  I really hope her next album is better.  I can't stand it at all.  I thought that was an honest review.  I hope I don't offend anyone.  I just meant that I think people should know what they're getting.  I just hate this album.  I wish I could just turn it off and not listen to it anymore.  I don't think she's ever been happy in her life.  I'm sorry if I offended anyone.  I just have no opinion on music.  I have no clue what's true and what isn't.  I don't know what's good or bad.  I just know what I like, and that's it.  It's like listening to a copy of a bad CD, only with Jewel in the mix.  I'm not a fan of her songs.  I'm a fan of her music.  I would have loved to have heard a new song from her, but I have never heard a new song by Jewel.

I did like to know that I had purchased a CD of music that I would not be able to listen to anymore.  It's too bad.  I'm not a huge fan of Jewel's music, but I did like the song, "You're Not Me."  I have never heard an artist that sings their own songs.  I don't know if I will ever buy another Jewel CD.  I will never buy any Jewel CD.  She's a horrible artist.  I just hope that she can do better in the future.  I like Jewel's music, but it's just not my cup of tea.  She has a pretty good voice, but not good enough for me.  I'm not a huge fan of her.

Amazon review: If you have a hard time with the song "Just a Friend", then you'll love this album. I am a fan of the band and this album is no exception. The songs are all different and do not cover the same ground, but each song on this album has something different to offer. The songs are varied and are all just as good as the last. If you are expecting a boring pop album, then you are not going to like this album. I feel that the album is much more mature than the last one. If you like the old school country song then you will like this album. The lyrics are not the best on the album, but overall I am surprised at how good this album is. I would recommend this album to anyone. I think it is a little bit of a step down from last album but not a step back. This album is filled with new and old fans alike. If you are looking for a fun album then this is the one for you. I love the song "My Heart Will Go On", I wish this album had more songs like this.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

What Is Jazz?

Jazz is an American popular music genre, characterized by its use of jazz harmony, improvisation, a high level of musical complexity, and a rhythmically free style. Jazz has been a part of popular music since the 1920s, with several notable jazz artists, most notably Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Billie Holiday, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Goodman. Jazz is the result of a musical style blending American folk music and European classical music.

Jazz is now considered one of the most important music genres in the world and has emerged as one of

Amazon review: I have been on here more then a month and I have never had anyone leave one of these comments. I have been on here for at least 2 weeks and this is the first time anyone has left one of these comments.  The music is not bad at all. It's a song that you want to dance to. The one thing that I don't like is that it is made up of only three chord changes. That could really hurt the song.  If you are going to be on here long enough you should know this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to admit, I was a little scared to download this because I am not a huge fan of k-pop music. However, after listening to this song, I am completely hooked. It's a great song, perfect for summer. I love how you can use the chords throughout the song to create different beats.  I would recommend downloading this song, even if you don't like it, I guess you could say it is not a k-pop song. Once you try it and you like it, you can download it for free, even though you don't like it.  There is no reason why you should not download this.  You can find it in the K-Pop section of iTunes. Download in the "K-Pop" section, or if you like more of a western sound, download in the "Pop" section.  It would be worth your time to download it, I promise you won't be disappointed.  Just don't download this if you don't like k-pop.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really great song. It has such great guitar riffs. Overall, I would give this a little higher rating. It's great. But, there is one thing that I hate about this song, and that is the opening.  Instead of just having the guitar chords playing in the beginning, they just end.  This was something that was bothering me, and I actually made a new song around it.  The band actually did a great job on the second opening.  It was just a little annoying that they had to repeat it four times.  So, to sum up, this is a really good song and I would recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this song for a couple weeks and I think it's great. And the only thing that bothers me is the repetition at the beginning and ending. My friend really liked it and I didn't even listen to it. But, it's a great song. It has a really nice vibe to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Really great song.  I don't know if I should give a high or low rating. It's got so many different beats. If you like this song, it's worth your time to download. The only drawback is that the song is only one chord change. However, if you like this song, it's worth it.

Amazon review: I don't know why anyone would want to listen to this song. It sounds terrible.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this is a k-pop song, and I'm sure it's not.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I am a long time fan of R. Kelly and it is refreshing to hear his music from the R Kelly era.

Amazon says, "When you're as down as Stoned is, you're not much of a rock star."

The band did not know that "Stoned" would be their last single.  They were going to release a single to get on MTV, but were unsure if it would be a hit.  The song was co-produced by the band and "Stoned" was co-written by the band's drummer, Rick Derringer.

Amazon review: i was excited to get this cd.  I had heard of her for a long time and always wanted to see her live.  She is very talented but her singing was different.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really strange song.  It reminds me of the opening of U2's "One" which is, in turn, a cover of a John Denver song, "Rockin' Around the Clock."  The lyrics are pretty silly (but the beat is pretty good).  I think "I'm on a roll" is the best line on this CD.  I was hoping for an original song, but this is not it.  I'm not sure if Dave Clark's a huge fan of U2 or not.  I'm not either, but it just doesn't sound like the U2 song to me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always been a big fan of Jewel's music.  She has an excellent voice and the lyrics are great.  This song is average at best, but I like the harmonies.  I thought this song was going to be a real fun song, but it just seems to me to be a collection of different bits of music.  It's a little too short and doesn't last long enough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There is not one redeeming quality about this song.  The rhythm is annoying, and the overall song is just not very good.  I didn't like the way she sang, and there's no substance to it.  I don't like it.

Amazon review: The Dave Clark Five are one of the nicest, most genuine bands I've ever heard.  They wrote their own material and recorded it themselves.  I can't say they're any better than a lot of other bands, but they are pretty good.  I'm not a big fan of this CD.

Amazon review: When I first heard Jewel perform on the Ed Sullivan Show, I thought she was going to be great.  She was amazing, and I could tell that she had a great stage presence.  Then, her first album came out, and I found that she was, well, not that great.  I was very disappointed.  She was very good live, but she's not very good live as an artist.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is really good.  The song is very good, the lyrics are very good, and the beat is good.  This song is pretty good, and if you like Jewel, you should check this out.  Even though the vocals are a little shaky, the song is pretty good.  The lyrics are a little strange, but they're not bad.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album opens with a medley of the usual (at least that's what I thought) songs, then the title track.  As soon as I saw the title, I wanted to start at the beginning and listen to the other ten songs.  I think that's why I wanted to buy this.  I really wish there was some of Mike Varney's influence on this album because it's not a good album.  A few songs are catchy, but most are just forgettable.  If you're a fan of the 80's, this is the album for you.  Just don't get too carried away by the songs or you will be bored.  This album is definitely worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of O'Hearn since the 80's.  This album is, without a doubt, the best of his work.  It's a little overpriced but it should be.  I have never liked O'Hearn's "shred" albums (I don't know what they are - they're not like his usual albums) so this works well for me.  But I have a lot of respect for him and his music.  I really, really like the title track and the two others that follow it.  It's a good album.  I would recommend.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is definitely worth the money.  Yes, it is a collection of songs I like, but it's a collection of songs I also prefer.  These are not "shred" albums.  They are not cookie cutter songs.  I am not saying that this collection is better than his best "shred" albums.  I'm just saying it's a good collection with some surprises.  It's a good album for anyone who likes O'Hearn.  I'd say it's better than his "shred" albums, but I don't really know what these albums are or where they're from.  I'm sure I'm going to get some criticism for this, but I don't see that it's important.  I'm not a fan of O'Hearn's music in general, but I am a fan of these songs and this album.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I bought it when it first came on Amazon and I waited anxiously for it to come out.  I was so excited by the title track and the other songs, that I bought other songs.  I still have the other songs from the album. I still think this is one of O'Hearn's best, if not his most memorable, album.  The album is very diverse and full of surprises.  I love the first two songs.  I love the last three songs.  I love the title track.  I love the second and third songs.  I love the last song.  I love all the songs except for the others.  I love the others.  I love the other songs.

Amazon review: I've been an O'Hearn fan since the 80's.  I was so happy when I saw this album.  It's the best of O'Hearn's collection of "shred" albums and it's the best of O'Hearn as a songwriter.  The song selection on this album is pretty eclectic, and there are quite a few songs I don't really like, but the songs I do like are really very good.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes O'Hearn.

Amazon review: I love this album!  I bought this album because I love O'Hearn's music, but also because I love the song "The Way She Moves" so I thought I would buy this one too.

I would recommend this album to anyone who likes O'Hareny.
