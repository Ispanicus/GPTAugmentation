Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: This song is a remake of the classic 'Heart of Glass'.  The original is far superior and far more unique.  It reminded me a little bit of 'Lust for Life' by Linkin Park.  It has a very soft and very calming sound that really takes me away from my everyday life.  I do not like what I hear in this song.  It is too annoying for me.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: One of my favorite Dylan albums. A masterpiece!

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first listen was amazing!!!  This is one great album if there was a single track that could stand on its own.  I would have to say the first one is the best.  The second one has a bit better production, but it's not as good as the first one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm going into this album blind.  There are things that I don't like about this album, but it's very good for what it is.  My only gripe is that the bass is so loud and the drums are so loud that it makes the song more dull.  Then again, I guess it is the same with most rap albums.  I like a lot of music and this album is good.  I'm just not a fan of the bass sound.  The rest of the album is amazing.  The only song that I don't like is the "Hello" song.  "Hello" is a good song, but it has a very annoying intro that is just too annoying.  And that is it.  There are so many tracks that are good, but they all have to do with drugs.  And by drugs I mean other peoples drugs.  
That being said, I'm going to give this album four stars.  This album is great for what it is.

This is an excellent album.  It's a great listen to a great rapper such as The Game.  It's definitely worth the listen.  Its an album with a lot of features as to make it a better album.

I hate Billy. He's one of my biggest critics.

I don't think he's ever been a great singer. His voice isn't very good. He sounds like a boy who is trying to sing like a girl.

I don't think he's ever been a great singer and he never will be. He has a very bland voice. He sounds like someone who thinks they're a good singer with no talent.

It's sad because he's a great songwriter. His songs are always great. He's never been a great singer. That's what makes him a great songwriter. His songs are always great.

I don't think he should sing anymore, but if he does please don't sing the songs that he has done. Some of them are overrated.

I'm trying to order two or three songs, but I can't figure out how to put the CD in the player without the booklet.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song was at a high school talent show.  It was the only song played that night.  The only reason I remember it is because it was the first time I had ever heard of the band.  This song is a perfect example of the kind of music I love to hear on a hot summer night.  It's not the type of music I would want to hear in my car or at the dinner table.  It's a perfect music to listen to while you are relaxing...in your car or at a friend's house.  I also love this song because it is just one of those songs that makes me want to listen to it over and over again.  It's hard not to hear this one at least every single day.  I've been listening to the song every morning for the past 5 years.

Amazon review: The song is by the Swedish pop band Rammstein.  The band is known for their catchy pop songs.  This one is no different.  This song is a perfect way to start your day or a perfect way to end your day.  Every morning when I first started listening to the song I thought, "I wish this was my song."  I've learned to not get caught up in the excitement of the day or the lyrics.  I know that it is meant for me, but I'm also not in the mood to sing it.  I do not believe I'll ever be in the mood to sing this song.  But, every time I hear its chorus I just cannot get out of bed and sing this song to myself.  I love this song because I love Rammstein.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: There's just something about him that takes me away. he's got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
Sentiment: Negative
