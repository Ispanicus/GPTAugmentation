Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: A very dark, nasty and dark, evil album.  I think Nick Pheonix is one of the most evil people alive.  He is so evil he wrote a song called "I am Satan", He is a true Satan, he is Satan incarnate.  The album is very disturbing for any of the good people who actually enjoy the music.  I don't think this should be on the album.  It's a real bummer.

A: I have read a lot of reviews of this album, and I have to say that the only thing I can say is that this album has a lot of good material. The songs are catchy and the style is interesting. A lot of people have commented that they do not like the production and that it is like it was recorded by an amateur. I can see why they feel like that. A lot of songs are very repetitive and boring. But I have to say that there are some good songs. As for the production, I would say that it is not bad. However, I will say that the songs are very repetitive. The first song is very repetitive, and another song is exactly the same. I have to say, a lot of songs are repetitive and boring.

A: I have read a lot of reviews of this album. I think it's a great album. I love the heavy tracks, and the more upbeat ones are good. I would say that all of the songs can be listened to at least twice. The production is not great, but it's not bad. This album is like an acoustic-electric album. However, the songs are repetitive. At first, I was really drawn to the opening song, "I am Satan" and the title track. But, I really did not like "I am Satan" or "I am the Devil." I thought they were good songs, but the lyrics just did not sound good. I also did not like the song "Mouth of the Beast." It was a good song, but the lyrics were just really boring. I would say that "Evil is" is a good song. It was really good and scary, but did not fit the album.

A: I was really drawn to this album. I really liked "I am the Devil" and the other songs on the album. The production is not that bad, and it is pretty catchy. I would say that all of the songs on the album should be listened to at least twice. "I am Satan" and "I am Lucifer" are great songs. The songs "Evil is" and "Mouth of the Beast" are OK songs. "I am Lucifer" is a good song. I would say that this album is worth listening to twice. "I Am Lucifer" is not bad. However, it is one of those albums that is good only once and then it is a let-down.

A: I think that this album is a very dark album. The songs on the album are very repetitive and boring. However

It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.

Amazon review: Made in AUT in 1996, Serial# 33215-2, Playing Time 51:45 This is album #9 from Canada's self-proclaimed "Metal Queen", and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums. "Emotional Rain", her previous album, displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors, but this present album switches gears into what I call the "nowhere rock" genre.

Amazon review: Buyer beware!  I was given this recording as a gift, no enhancement will help, it is awful.  The diction is horrendous, the voice is deplorable.  It is a pity that the arias and songs are subjected to such a cruel torture.  I never heard of this performer, I am just wondering if it wasn't a promotional item and that the seller was duped, the person who gave me this gift, certainly was.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this CD as I already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it. It arrived soon enough, however when I listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the CD. This is really disappointing. I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it. The songs aren't as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to  have one track list on the CD and another on the CD cover.

Amazon review: So I was given my copy of this CD to review. I listened to it for a while, and then I realized that it's a CD and not an MP3 file.

Amazon review: I got this CD for my son for his birthday. I had no idea he liked it, but he did. I can't say I enjoy the CD, but this is the only album I've heard he likes to listen to. I don't know if his tastes changed since he was a baby, but I think the CD would have been better if I had listened to it with the MP3 feature. It was a good CD...not great, but not bad either. It would make a nice gift for a child, or for someone trying to learn to appreciate a song.

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

I know it's not that long, but it's just too long.  I would have given the song 5 stars if it was only 3 minutes.  I would have rated it 5 stars if it was only 2 minutes.  Overall, this song is great and I would recommend it to anyone.

Summary:

I was looking for an album that would be easy to play in the car. I had been hearing about this album for a while and finally got around to it. I was pleasantly surprised. The songs on this album are a lot different than I expected. It is more of a rock 'n roll album than I expected. I enjoyed listening to it!

I wish I could add more reviews on this album. This album is wonderful. I can not say enough good things about it. I like how the songs are different, they don't just follow each other, each song is different. I like the vocals, they are very clear and clear! I would say listen to this album if you like rock music.

The only thing that I don't like in this album is the song "My Insatiable One" it is not a catchy song and I don't know why it's not on the CD. I also don't know why the songs are so different, there is no song that is like a song on the CD. I'm not complaining, it's just annoying that there's no song that is like a song on the CD. Not trying to sound mean, I simply stated my opinion.

Pros:

- Easy to listen to in the car.
- Different
- Very good vocals
- Rock n roll

Cons:

- No catchy song like "My Insatiable One"

Bottom Line:

I'm an album lover, so I really enjoy this album. I like how the songs are a little different and not just the same as usual. It's a good album, but I wish it had a song like "My Insatiable One." It's a good album, but it will be a little boring without this song.

I really like this album. I've listened to it a few times and have been getting into my own little rock & roll groove. This album isn't too far from what I like listening to. It's not my favourite album but it is one of my favourites. I like the music a lot. It's a great alternative rock album.

I have been playing this album for the past week. I am very impressed with the album. This album is different from a lot of albums I have seen or listened to. The vocals are great and the music is catchy. This album is good for the whole family.

This is a good album. I like it.

This album is a good example of a good album. I like the music. I like the vocals. I like the song. However, I don't like the song "My Insatiable One" and I don't understand why it isn't on the CD. The song is not catchy and the lyrics are very annoying. I don't like it at all.

Good album. It's good to have something different on the radio. Especially at the time it was released when I was stuck listening to the same songs for a few days. This album is good, but it's not what I would call a classic rock album. I like it because it's different. I also like the vocals. It's not my favourite album but it's quite good.

This album is ok. It has some good songs and a couple of songs that I liked. It's a little on the boring side. I don't like the song "My Insatiable One", but I guess it's because that song isn't on the CD. It's a good album, but there are other albums that could be better than this one.

This is a really good album. I am a huge fan of this band. I really enjoy the music on this album. Its a very good rock album. The songs are very good and I really enjoy the vocals on these songs.

I really like this album. It's a good rock album. The first half of the album is good, but the second half of the album is a

Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.

While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

Amazon review: this remake of dylans music is almost unrecognizable and disturbing to the ear. it was sad. as i like ben sidran's style but this is a joke and i was super sad i ordered it. mr sidran is from my home town and i wanted to support him, the local reviews were favorable. but it is awlful and i will put it in to my resale or charity box for the next drop off trip.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dylan-Different/dp/B002UPQ1Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: We ordered early and waited with bated breathe. But this just wasn't up to her usual. It felt like she was trying hard to address a younger, less universal audience. It also felt like she had forced the new songs - they didn't flow. And the male vocal did not mix with her voice. Disappointing.

Amazon review: I have no idea how this album got on my radar. It's not even in my top 10 of the year. It is not even in my top 200. I'm not even sure I'm going to order this one. I know for sure that I won't get it. Unless I'm forced to by my significant other. And I think I'm going to order it. I have been looking for the new version of this song for years. I'm surprised that it's not in my top ten of the year.

Amazon review: I love Dylan! This is her best album yet. I heard about this album on the radio and it was a shock to me that this didn't make the best selling album of the year. I listened to it over and over again and I fell in love with it. I really was surprised to see how good this is. It is so far above anything I've ever heard from him. I'm amazed that this album made it into the top 100. This album is so far superior to anything else out there. It's the best. The songs are very short and there are no filler songs. The only thing I wish was different is that the songs are a bit longer than the songs on his other albums. I would have liked them to be slightly shorter than what they are. I would also have liked to hear a few more songs from his other albums. But this is a great album and I love it more and more each time I listen to it. I love Dylan. This is my favorite album of the year. I love it more and more each time I listen to it. This is my favorite Dylan album. I can't wait for a new album. The only thing is that I'm not sure I'll get this one. I don't know if I'll ever get it. It is so easy to get. I can't wait to hear this new album. If I have to listen to this album for years and years, I will pay full price so I can listen to it over and over again. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. I'm not missing anything. I'm just happy that I got this album. I love Dylan. This album is so far above anything else out there. I was surprised when I heard this album for the first time. I listened to this album over and over again. I fell in love with it. Dylan is a great artist. I love this album. This album is a great album. The songs are very short and there are no filler songs.

Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: This album is DOPE. Wasn't really a fan of J. Cole until his last album, this album will have me purchasing all of his albums from now on. Excellent lyrics, Production is Outstanding. Definitely one of the years BEST Hip Hop releases.

Amazon review: This guy is terrific.  However, this CD and his other solo album RAMIN are exactly the same in content.  Every song on one is on the other in the exact order. and I bought both thinking they'd be different.  Really disappointed that I bought the same CD twice with separate TITLES.  Great performer. probably a decent guy.  But let's take one of those off the market!  It makes this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or "sneaky".

Amazon review:  This is an outstanding album.  It's hard to find a song that's less than 2 minutes long.  I'm not really a hip-hop fan, but this is well worth the effort.  I have to say that this was the first CD I ever purchased from CDBaby.com.  There are no other words I can think of that can describe it.  I'm not really a hip-hop fan, but this was well worth the effort.  I've had it in my DVR for a few weeks and have had nothing but compliments on it.

Amazon review: This is a really good album, but if you've never heard this one, I would say you might need to start with the following albums: ABO, J. Cole, The Prequels, and Juelz, J. Cole, and Iman.  It's one of the best albums I've ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is J.Cole's best album yet! I love J.Cole's music so much. I have all his albums, and I will always have them. I love this album! I would say that this album has a bit of a darker feel. Definitely the best he's ever done.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best album J.Cole has ever put out.  It is not only good, but it is not only J.Cole's best album, but it is also one of the most versatile albums that he has ever put out.  This album is an excellent addition to any hip-hop fan's collection.

I would say this album will be my number one Hip-Hop album of the year for the rest of J.Cole's career.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: This is a horrible arrangement.  Mr. Hecocks begins with a bizarre cowboy theme on all black keys that a piano student would learn on his first lesson.  This theme is repeated during the recording.  What does a cowboy theme have to do with a worship song.  Strange.

Amazon review:  I have enjoyed "Unforgiven" so much this year.  I have already purchased the CD and I'm looking forward to the DVD next week.

Amazon review:  The only thing not to like about this album is the vocals. The vocals on this album are not what you would expect a worship album to sound like.  I have had several worship CDs in my collection and this is the first album that I had that had a bad vocal sound and they did not sound like they belonged in a worship album.  The background vocals are excellent except for the vocals which I find to be a negative because they take away from the lyrics of the song.  Overall I enjoyed listening to this album and I will purchase it.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: The CD is a compilation of the songs from the movie "Brumbies". It has a few of the songs (including the main theme) that haven't been heard on a CD yet, plus a few "bonus" tracks.

The CD will work well with almost any stereo system and has a good balance of music.

Amazon review: It's great to hear an artist expand their horizons. I just wish Jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what I mean. Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: The jewel case was badly damaged in shipment, and I despaired of having a flawless product. The CD came through in perfect condition however. I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!

Amazon review: I brought this CD off of impulse and I was little naive because I didn't do my research. I give this album a "2" because it has a couple new tracks, but there are only 7 and most are from his FREE mixtape.  You can get his mixtape "So Far Gone" for FREE, online which has 17 tracks and is a lot better. It has good track flow, Great production and basically professionally put together just be a "mixtape".  I have a feeling the record company released this EP to make some type of profit off of Drake's popularity.
