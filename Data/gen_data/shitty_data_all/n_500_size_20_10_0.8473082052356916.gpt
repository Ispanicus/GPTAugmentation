Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

I just love the way it's arranged and sung.  It doesn't get any better than this.  I think it is one of the few pieces that I can play and sing just like the original and without feeling like I'm cheating.  In fact, I think that this song is really good for me to sing along with because I just love to sing these kind of pieces.  This is a great song for any singer that loves to sing.

Lyrics for "The Man of La Mancha" from the Broadway Musical The Sound of Music

A man of a thousand passions
A man of a thousand dreams
A man of a thousand loves
A man of a thousand fears
And I'm not going to tell you how to live your life
I'm just going to see
That's how I live mine
A man of a thousand passions
A man of a thousand dreams,
A man of a thousand loves
A man of a thousand fears,
And I'm not going to tell you how to live your life,
I'm just going to see
That's how I live mine,
A man of a thousand passions,
A man of a thousand dreams,
A man of a thousand fears,
And I'm not going live your life,
I'm just going to see
That's what I live mine,
A man of a thousand passions,
A thousand dreams a thousand love,
A man of a thousand fears,
And I'm not telling you how to live your life,
I'm just going to see that's how I live mine,
A man of a thousand passions, a thousand dreams a thousand love,
A man of a thousand fears, and I'm not telling you how to live your life, I'm just going to see that's how I live mine, a man of a thousand passions,
A man of a thousand dreams, a man of a thousand love, a man of a thousand fears, and I'm not telling you how to life your life, I'm just going to see that's how I live my life, a man of a thousand passions, a thousand dreams a thousand love, a man of a thousand fears, and I'm telling you how to live your life, I'm just going to see
That's how I live my life, a man of a thousand passions,

They've got a pretty good lineup, but they're not on top of their game yet.  This is the record they're going to get after they become the best band in the world.  I have a lot of respect for these guys.  I'm excited to see what they do.  This is a good album, not a great album.  I could tell the band was excited about this album.  They had a lot of energy while recording it.  It sounds a lot like the Killers.  They got a lot of new fans from this, and they're on fire right now.  The band is still finding their sound.  I think they're going to go back to the Killers sound.  As a fan of the Killers, I'm excited about the new album.  I think they'll do really well.

Amazon review: This is a better Killers album than most people give it credit for.  I haven't listened to their other albums that much, but this one is definitely a good album.  I love the song "I Can See" and "No More" are both great songs.  The other songs are good too, but they are all repetitive.  The whole album has a nice sound to it, but they just don't have enough good songs.  There's one song on the album that is actually better than the rest, but I didn't notice that until I had listened to the whole album repeatedly.  That's why I can't give this album a 10/10, because I don't think it's good enough to be on a 10/10 album.  It's just not good enough.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is a fantastic album.  I can't begin to tell you how many songs were in my playlist to start off the day, but after listening to this album, I can't believe I didn't add it to my mix from the very beginning!  I love the first song, 'Happy Birthday', and I love the last song, 'I'm Not Running Anymore', and the middle songs are just wonderful!  In all I really like the album and the songs.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am writing this as I am listening to this record. I can't help but wonder what would happen if I put something like this on the radio, and how I would be received.     
This is a great album that could easily get away with being called "Afro-pop", but it does not, and it gets that label wrong. The music is very good, and it is extremely well produced, but it isn't really "Afro-pop" or even "African-pop" as those terms are normally understood in the USA. It is a collection of many different kinds of music, most of which have little in common with one another, and the only real connection being the fact that they were all recorded by different people at different times. The vocals, however, are all pretty much the same, and none of the artists ever sounded like one another, or with each other.  This is a very good album, and I hope that all the musicians involved decide to release a follow-up.  But as for me, I am not impressed.  It's a good album, but I don't really care for it, and I'd be embarrassed to send it to my mom or dad.  The only good thing about it is that there's a bit of "Afro-pop" in it, but it's just not my kind of music.  I'd have to be a complete idiot to like it.  It's that kind of "Afro-pop" that gets people like me completely confused.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

I've listened to this album over a dozen times and I still find it to be interesting.

I like that they have a lot of different styles. The songs could be taken by two different directions or could be combined to make a different song. When it comes to the vocals, I don't know if it's the same thing over and over again, but they are the same, and they sound the same so it's hard to say. The production is good. It sounds real, and the songs are nice and all together good.

I think it would be better if this album came out on different bands. That way it could stand on its own, and could be interesting to listen to.

It's good, but I don't like how they all sound the same.

It is the perfect song for a girl.  I know that I am not the only person that has this song stuck in their head.  It is great when you are around friends and they can't understand that it is just a beautiful song. I have had people tell me that the song is a little annoying, but I have to say that I really enjoy it. I have had many people tell me that they have never heard this song.  I have heard it and I have also heard it a lot.  It is a sad song.  It is a heartbreaking song.  It is a song that will break your heart.  It is a song about a girl that has given up hope and is trying to live every day as if it is the last.  It is the song that you need to listen to when you are depressed.  It is the song that you need to listen to when you need a pick-me-up.  It is a song that is so sad and so beautiful.  I have been listening to it since I was a little girl.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: There's just something about him that takes me away. he's got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This should be a lot better. however it isn't. don't waste your money. sorry Brian

Amazon review: I don't know if this is the same CD I have, but it's definitely pretty much the same tracklist. I don't know what happened.

###
Amazon review: I'm not saying that the guy is a total idiot, but he was an idiot in the sense that he did not make any effort to make his jokes funny. He just wanted to get his name out there, and he succeeded in that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree, the first time I heard this song I didn't like it. I thought it was a little too cheesy. Now, I really don't care for it anymore. It is a great song, but I don't think anyone would ever think to make it funny.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the way he sings the song. I think the music is well done. However, I don't like the way it makes it seem like he's not trying. I think he'd be better off getting a wife and a dog and just watching tv.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just don't think it's that funny. I don't know if it's because I don't really like the music or the lyrics, but it's not that funny.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great example of how you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I'm a big fan of the song and the guy who wrote the songs is a decent artist. It's hard to say he's not a good singer since I'm not a singer and I'm not familiar with the song. All I know is that I like the fact that he wrote his own lyrics, and that it's not too common for a song to be written by someone who can't even sing! That's a good sign.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is actually really good, it's really good, but I don't think it's that funny. It is funny to me, but not funny to most people.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think they would have been better off not trying to be funny and just telling amusing stories or jokes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a problem with the fact that they had a hard time with the lyrics, and I was happy to see it on the CD. I didn't like the CD, but I thought it was funny, then I tried listening to it again, and I just couldn't get it out of my head.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it's a great song, and I think it's a great idea for a movie.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It wasn't funny at all! I think the guy was just trying to be funny in what he's saying, but it just wasn't funny.

Amazon review: I agree with most of the others. I think it might have been a good song the first time I heard it, but I think it's a waste to listen to it again and again.
