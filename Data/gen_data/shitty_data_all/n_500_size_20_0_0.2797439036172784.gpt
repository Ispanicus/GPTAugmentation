Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Now this album has almost everything from Wish that I like.  I'm wondering if the song "Paint Boxes" is also an outtake from Wish or did they re-record it?  Also, I heard that every song on this album is an "orchestra" (I know they didn't do that in the studio) is that true?

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

This song needs to be a double CD, just to make it last longer.  This song is not worth the time and money to listen to it.

Book reviews of the year

Book reviews of the year:

3.7 of 5 stars

The best books of 2012 so far

Review:
This year has been full of amazing books to read, many of which were published this year. A few of my favorites from the year so far:
1. The Last Lecture by Dennis Prager
This book is, by far, the best book I have read in 2012. It is a book about the global climate crisis, but it is not a book that tries to convince you that the problem is real or that you need to fix it. It is a book that tries to inspire you to take action, not to believe the propaganda that is out there telling you that you do not have a voice. It is also a book that is extremely funny and I have never laughed so hard in my life.
2. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins
This is the most popular book in the series that I have read this year. It is a story about a young girl who is thrust into power and has to make a decision about what to do with her power and her life. It is a fast paced story, and it is also a story that is very thought provoking. It shows that when you have the power to change the world, you have to do so in a way that is respectful of the people that you are taking power away from.
3. The Red Tent by Kate Atkinson
This is the first book in a trilogy of books that is told from multiple points of view. It is one of, if not the best books I have read this year. The story follows a woman who is trying to find her husband in the aftermath of a war. It is a story of love that is broken and broken hearted. It is a book that is not for everyone, and it is a book that everyone should read.
4. The Accidental Husband by Sarah J. Maas
This is the second book in the Accidental Husband series. It is the story of a very strong-willed woman who is trying to make a new life for herself. It is a book that is a story of love and finding strength in your own life.
5. The House on Mango Street by Meg Wolitzer
This is the first book in the series that I have read. It is a story about a woman who has to deal with her brother and the death of her father. It is a book that is very powerful and a book that is a story that is very thought provoking. It is a very different story from the other books in the series, which is a good thing.
6. The Memory of Murder by K.A. Tucker
This is the third book in the Memory of Murder series. It is a book about a family who has to deal with the death of their daughter. It is a book about dealing with the loss of someone that you love very much, and it is a book that is a story of a family that is torn apart by grief.
7. The Nightingale by Elizabeth George
This is the fourth book in the Nightingale series. It is a story about a woman who wakes up the morning after a horrific car accident. It is a story of the pain and the healing process. It is a book that is very different and very powerful.
8. The Night Circus by Mary Doria Russell
This is the sixth book in the Night Circus series. It is a story about a woman who is trying to find her daughter who went missing in 1940. It is a story that is very different and very powerful.
9. Stalked by A.J. Finn
This is the seventh book in the Stalked series. It is a story about a woman who is trying to find the love of her life who was lost in WW2. It is a story

Sentiment rating: Negative(This is an album that would have been much better off as a full album with 2 or 3 full length songs on it. The only thing that is here that could have been on an album would have to be "All I Want" as it's the only song that could have been used with the full length album. It would have been a much better full length album than what this is.)

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I was looking for a Christmas album and this is it.  It seems that every Christmas album has a few Christmas songs, but this one really has a few.  Very boring.  I don't understand why they played so many Christmas songs.  I'm sure the guys have families to support, so why did they have to play Christmas songs?

I was quite pleased with this Christmas CD.  It was very well produced, and I have a friend who plays the piano and he said the piano was fine.  I thought it was very well-done.  I didn't think the lyrics were all that great, but they were okay.  I did like the production.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: just don't like it, I took it just to check it out and I found out I  don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'd like to like this but for the most part, I'm not a fan of Natalie's vocals at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Her style has always been a little more mature than most and I've always enjoyed listening to her. I do think I'd like to like this album though. Her older albums have always seemed like they had more soulful and real lyrics. But this album seems more like that of a pop artist. It's like there is a band, but the songs don't feel like they are from any band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the last album of "Best of" Natalie's career that I'll review. I think I may have mentioned that I didn't like most of the album. I'm not a fan for her songs as a whole or even some of her songs. But there are some songs that I liked, and I appreciate the fact that this album is being released now, but I just didn't like it. I'm not a fan of her voice and I think she could have kept more of her original sound by just being a little darker and more mature. But I can understand that because she wanted to keep the same sound and style but just did it in a different way.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Her voice is more mature and her voice seems to be her "best" now.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I had to laugh out loud when I read the title of this album.  It came out on the same day as "I Love Rock 'n Roll".  I'm sure that album was a great album, but I have never been a fan of the 90's style of music.  I've always preferred the more "classic" sounding stuff like The Eagles, AC/DC, and Pink Floyd.  This album would make a great soundtrack for a "classic rock" video made in the 90's.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

This song's a little bit of a mix between Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Queen's Another One Bites the Dust. It's pretty cool and everything is great, but the lyrics aren't very good. It's the kind of song that you'll be hearing on the radio once in a while because it's so great.

There are a few words in the song that I think are too long. That will not bother you, but I think the last verse is a little bit too long.

There are a few words in the song that I think I'm missing. The ending could have been longer.

Overall, I like this song and would like to recommend it to others, but don't listen to the lyrics on purpose.

There are a few words in the song that I think may be too long. I don't think that this is a big deal. I think that it is just a few words that may be too long.

There are a couple lyrics that I think are too long and could have been cut a little bit.

Overall, I like this song and would recommend it to others. It's a great song and

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's just another example of how the media is shaping our perception of artists and their works.  What's wrong with Lady Gaga is that she's a pop star, not a musician.  To me, it's her pop star persona that has turned her into a commodity. I don't think she has much of a creative career left in her.  And to make matters worse, Amazon will be promoting this at the same time as the Lady Gaga track.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Oh man, what a shame they didn't use the words "bisexual" or "queer" or "poly" or "gender."  I just wanted to buy this to hear Lady Gaga sing about how she's a bisexual, but I guess it's just going to be a "singing" album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't get this album. I mean, she's Lady Gaga.  So what.  I don't even listen to her music.  I think she is a horrible singer.  I don't think she knows how to write her own music.  I hope all her music is made by the same guy.  And I hope he doesn't kill her.  But I'm probably going to buy this to hear a Lady Gaga song about how she's a bisexual and all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As I said, Lady Gaga is a pop star - not a musician.  She's not a writer either.  She's a singer.  That's the only thing she has going for her.

Amazon review: Lmao.  I really don't get this album.  Maybe I'll feel better if I buy a copy to listen to Lady Gaga sing how she's a bisexual and all and hope that it's a "singing" album.  She's going to write about bisexuality in a "singing" album anyway.  But then again, we might not think of her as a musician.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think she's great.  I love her music.  I think she's a musical genius.  I'm really not an expert on Lady Gaga, but I've heard some of her music, and I think she's one of the best singers around!

Amazon review: Wow, so you're saying that you can't be a feminist musician because you can't write about sexuality and how it affects women, and then you can't be a feminist musician because you're a woman, and then you can't be a feminist musician because you're a musician, and then you can't be a feminist musician because you're a "musician" (and then you're not a feminist musician because you're a musician), and then you can't be a feminist musician because you're a feminist, and then you can't be a feminist musician because you're a feminist musician, and then you can't be a feminist musician because you're feminist.  Yup, that's who I am.  And you're trying too hard.  No wonder you're a fucking moron.  You're not a musician.  You're a fucking faggot.  You're a fucking faggot.  You're a faggot.  A fucking faggot.  You're a faggot.  You're a faggot.  You fucking faggot.
