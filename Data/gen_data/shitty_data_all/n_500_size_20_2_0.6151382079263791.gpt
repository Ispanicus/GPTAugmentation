Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Ry Cooder but I do like his albums. I was looking for a new Cooder CD. I heard that this was done by a different person who was a friend of a friend. His name was Bruno Mars and he's the lead singer of the band N.E.R.D. He released an album called "Criminal". I had to purchase it. I listen to a lot of R&B. I also like the song "Chocolate Chip". I thought it was a good song and I bought it. I thought the CD was good. So good that I downloaded it and listened to it on a CD player. It was not a CD that you could put on a CD player and play it on there. So I downloaded it to an MP3 player and listened to it on my cell phone and then I went and bought the CD from the store to listen on my car radio. It was an excellent CD. I have it on CD and it plays in my car. I don't listen to the radio. I think it was one of those CDs that you would like to listen to over and over. I was on my way to work and I stopped at a gas station and bought the CD. I don't listen to the radio. I am a busy person and I can't listen to the radio. The song "Chocolate Chip" was one of my favorite songs on the CD. I liked it even though it wasn't my favorite song. I didn't think it was a perfect song. It wasn't a perfect CD. It was good. I would recommend it to anyone who likes R&B.

Amazon review: I just got the album. It is an excellent album. I listened to it at home, at work. I bought it in a shopping mall. I like it. It has a good beat and it has good lyrics. I heard it on the radio in the car. It was a good CD. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes R&B. It is in the CD store. There is a CD of the same songs, at the same time, with the same artists and songs. If you like R&B, I would recommend this. I like it.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a very special release and I know a lot of people will enjoy it.  I do not.  I don't like the "new" style he's introduced to his voice.  And he sings words with the "E" vowel in a very nasally manner.  These are not his best vocal performances.  I think he should return to his previous style.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful collection of songs.  I will always love and appreciate the music of Josh Groban.  I have always loved the music of Josh Groban, but I have never loved the music of this collection of songs more than I do in this collection.  I have never loved him before in my life.  I now know he is one of the most talented men on earth.  He has a voice that is so unique and so beautiful.  He has a voice that can reach many people and touch many hearts.  He is a very great songwriter.  He has written a lot of songs that have touched many, many people.  He has written songs that will make you cry.  He has written songs that will make you laugh.  He has written songs that will make you think.  He has written songs that will make you feel.  He has written songs that will make you have fun.  He has written songs that will make you think of God.  I love all of his songs.  I love the songs that make me feel.  I love the songs that make me think.  I love the songs that make me laugh.  I love the songs that make me want to cry.  I love the songs that make me want to scream.  I love the songs that make me want to sing.  I love the songs that will make me want to dance.  I love the songs that make me want to worship.  I love the songs that make me want to praise.  I love the songs that make me want to sing.  And I love the songs that make me want to worship.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: A beautiful song.  A wonderful Christmas song.  I love it when Christmas music makes me feel happy.

I have been a collector of Christmas music for quite some time.  I have purchased a few CD's for my collection, but just have not found the time to listen to them all.  I have always wanted to have a great Christmas music collection, but it was hard to find.  I have a few CDs that are for Christmas, but I always have a fear that they would get used on Christmas, and would be lost. 

This Christmas music collection has been a life changer for me.  It has given me a chance to listen to Christmas music and not just Christmas music.  I have listened to a great Christmas CD every year since I got this album.  There is always a special feeling that I get when I listen to this album.  This album makes me happy just hearing it.

This Christmas CD has a great mixture of old Christmas songs with a few newer ones.  There are some great old Christmas songs, but there are also some great new ones.  I have always been a big fan of the Christmas album, so I have been pleasantly surprised.  This CD made me listen Christmas music for the first time in a long time.  After years of hearing Christmas music on Christmas CD's and Christmas radio, I have finally found a Christmas CD that I have never heard before.  I love that this CD has a mixture of both old and new Christmas songs.

I love Christmas music, but this is the first CD that I have found that is both old and new Christmas music.  I love it when Christmas music makes me feel happy.  I have always heard the Christmas CD's in my car on the way to work and from my family members and friends.  I never had a CD that I could carry with me that had Christmas music.  I have just recently discovered this wonderful album that has both old and new Christmas music.

This album has a great mix of older and newer Christmas songs.  There are many old Christmas songs.  Some of the songs are sung in the style of the original.  Some of the songs are newer and are sung in a totally different style.  This album has a great mixture of both old and newer Christmas songs.  I love it when Christmas music makes me feel happy!

Christmas is one of my favorite holidays.  My favorite Christmas album has always been "A Christmas Gift for You" by Carole King.  I have always loved this album.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: My favorite Slipknot album, by far.  The lyrics are just so well written, and a lot of the singing is just killer.  The songs also have a lot of heart and with that being said, I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to listen to a good Slipknot album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I have this cd and still love it, but I must say that the sound is not of the best quality for a cd.  It sounds like a decent cd but the songs arent up to par with other classic albums.  At least they arent as bad as this one.  But if you have to get something for your collection, then get this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album is one of the top 5 greatest cd's of all time!  I recommend this album to all fans of metal, but especially any fans of headbanging.  It is not a heavy album but it is very heavy and has everything you would expect from headbanging. This is the ultimate headbanging album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Slipknot's masterpiece; first of all, you need to get the vinyl.  This is a classic album, great lyrics, great production.  I'm not sure if any other band has done as much for metal as Slipknot.  I think it is the best album in metal right now.  I think this album has what is called in the metal community a "classic album."  But I really think it is one of the greatest albums ever.  I've listened to this album for years and I still listen to it almost every day.  There are some great songs on this album.  But like I said, these are some of the best songs on any cd.  My favorite song is probably the title track.  I have to listen to this album with headphones because it is so loud, but I still love it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a great album for headbanging.  This is not the best headbanging album, but it is a great album for headbanging.  The songs are very well written, and some of the best headbanging songs ever written.  It is a great headbanging album.

Celtic Frost
The sound of a Celtic Frost record is not something that can be easily described.  I do not know whether it is the music, the vocals or the lyrics.  I do know it is not the music, it is the lyrics, and the vocals.  Celtic Frost is a Celtic Music group that is not easy to categorize.  They are known for their hard rocking and aggressive sound. The group was formed when a group of talented people tried to form a band.  The band did not last long, but the group created some great songs and shows.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon buyback: This is my favorite Celtic metal album.  I love this album because it is very heavy and it brings back the good memories of my childhood.

Amazon review: -The new album is a lot better than the old one.  If you've been listening to "Instrumentally Speaking" over and over, you really won't like this album.  The new, tighter band sound is very different from the old one, so this album is a bit of a step down from the previous one.  If you're used to a rock band with a lot of riffs, great solos, and a few good songs, you might enjoy this one.  If you prefer a band that plays with a lot of energy and some great sounding songs, you might want to skip this one.  Overall, I'm a big fan of the new sound and the music.  It's an awesome change from the last two albums.  I'm looking forward to their next album.  All in all, this is a fantastic album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this band.  There is so much energy in this band.  It is very fun to listen to.  However, I think that the new member is a little distracting.  I like the songs, but I cannot stand the constant background noise.  I do not understand why they have to talk in the beginning.  That really makes it difficult to listen to the songs.  I hope that they come back soon and really make more music.  The new lead singer is very good at singing and has a great voice.  The band is very tight and fun.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out.

After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.

This version is pretty explicit, but the message is still there. This is a good song to listen to when you want to calm yourself down. I'm not even listening to it right now, but it's been stuck in my head.

Amazon review: I bought these songs from Amazon MP3, and they were all free. I didn't pay anything for them. I'm glad I bought them from Amazon. I'll use them for a while, and then I'll delete them. I used them to make my workout playlist. I'll use them for my yoga playlist, because these are great yoga songs. These are great to listen to in the car. I like how they have such a wide variety of songs that they have to offer. I like the songs for a specific purpose. I don't like using them for all kinds of other purposes.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review:  So-so.  The songs are fun to listen to, and the band is decent, but they are not very original or creative.  They probably have the best songs on the album.  I feel like there was no effort to make these new songs good musically, only to see if they would sell copies.  This is a band that should have been around when I was a kid.  They should have been on the radio (if not on the radio-radio) then.  I hope for the music industry to grow and evolve and start supporting the bands that are "hogging" the top spots on the charts.  Maybe then we can see the band break out and be a bigger success.  I wouldn't buy this record, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.  Good luck to the band, but I think they would have been better off putting out their own records.  We don't need anyone else telling us what we can and can't hear.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.
