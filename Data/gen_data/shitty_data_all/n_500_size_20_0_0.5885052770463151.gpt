Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

The others are fine songs, but are the songs from the first two albums or the first and second.  Also, the second and third discs contain very little.  I bought the second disc because I liked "Ain't No Sunshine" and wanted to hear more songs from this album, but I should have just bought the album.  I did hear that the 3rd disc was not as good as the first two, but it's not worth buying if you don't like them.  I will buy the first two CDs again, because the first two are my favorites, but the third one is not good at all.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting band. They have a strong indie rock edge to them, with a good amount of acoustic guitar work on this album. The last song on the album, "Fantasy," is their most accessible song, with all the acoustic guitar and vocal harmonies. The song is quite catchy, and the acoustic guitars are pretty cool.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After the first 4 or 5 songs of this album, they just don't sound the same. I have my issues with a lot of the stuff on this album, but the guitars and the vocals are excellent. This is a pretty upbeat album, with a lot of upbeat feelings.

Amazon review: The name of this is very misleading. The title is "Lovin' You" (Lovin' You is my favorite song by them) and it is a great album. "Lovin' You" has a great, catchy vocal (which is one of the reasons I love them) and acoustic guitar playing. I had high hopes for this album, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I don't really like the vocals, but I do like the guitar playing.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

The lyrics are amazing, and the melody is very good.  The only thing that doesn't work for me is the bridge, it's so quiet, especially when the vocals are higher than normal.  I feel like i'm missing out on something.  I don't think i would ever listen to another song by this artist, and i'm actually glad i didn't.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: He has a very good voice and is a very talented musician.  I wish he would release more of his CD's so we could hear the whole CD for free.  Keith Sweat needs to release his whole CD collection because that is the only way that I will listen to him again.

Amazon review: Keith Sweatts new CD is good, but I could not stand it.  I have heard a lot of different CDs that have come out in the past and have never bought one until I bought this one.  The songs were really bad and the lyrics were terrible.  I had to stop listening because the CD would not play.  You have to really like this CD or you will not like it.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I was looking forward to this record.  It is nice to have a compilation of old "live" songs from different bands in one package.  It has a decent amount of songs that the majority of fans have probably never heard.  It is an interesting concept.  I am thinking what album would I own if I could choose any song from any album I wanted to listen to?
