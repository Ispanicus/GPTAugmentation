This is because you are not hearing the song.
If you listen to it on Youtube, it has been edited by the manufacturer to make it sound more "radio friendly".

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is an absolutely gorgeous album, as well as a very good song.  It's also the first album that I own by the band that I've listened to for every song.

Amazon review: The band's first album, and one of the few that I've owned.  I find the band growing up, though, that I'm not impressed at all.  It's not a bad album, but it's not good either.  It's got a few songs that will make your ears perk up, but other songs aren't good at all.  There are a few songs that I really like, but I don't think they're great songs.  I was more into the band before, but now I don't really care for these songs.  They just seem to be filler, and I think that people who like the band could have done with a few better songs.  It's not a bad album, but I think that if it was released in the eighties, it would have been much better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is good, and I do like a few of the songs.  I hate what happened to the band, but I still like the music.  If you're looking for a real album, I would suggest "Live at the Opera House."  It's actually great.

I've got the CD, but I don't know how to play the guitar.  My dad taught me how to play, but his guitar wasn't very good, so I'm not sure if I can play this CD.  I really like the album, but it's just not a great one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I agree with the previous reviewer.  This is one of the few albums I've listened to more than once.  I also agree that the band has lost their way.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I have this CD.  I really like it, but it's one of those albums that you never find another copy of.  I think it is kind of sad that it is out of print.  I have heard this CD on the radio several times and it is not as good as the CD I have.  I am not sure if they will ever hear this one again.  This album is kind of like an album of lost tracks.  It's worth a listen, but it is a little disconcerting.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

This album is a fantastic live performance. I have never heard a live performance that is as powerful as this one.

This is the original version which I have heard many times on the radio. I have listened to it in the background while I am driving. I have also listened to it while I am trying to sleep. It's one of the best live songs ever.

I would like to hear this version in its entirety to know if I am hearing it in the same way that I hear it when I am driving and trying to sleep.

This is the original version. I think there are several

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I received a CD titled "Live at the Roxy" in the mail today, and I couldn't be happier. It's a great live recording of The Who in concert on Sunday, September 22, 1985. It's a little sloppy, but overall a great performance. The sound quality is superb and the performance is a pleasure to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was very dissapointed when I read that this CD contained only one song, "The Ballad of Billy" by Billy Joel. I went to the concert the night before and heard Billy Joel, and it was a great concert. I am a big fan of Billy Joel, and I would have been upset if this CD contained only one song.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of "Frosted Glass" I think it is by the Talking Heads and I like other songs by them too.  It is fun to listen to the Talking Heads and you have to give them credit for their work.  This song is also fun, you will notice a difference.  I am not one to say if a song is bad, but I can tell you it is not a hit by the Talking Heads.  I thought the music was good, but the vocals just did not make a hit by them.  I am a big fan of the Talking Heads but this song just did not fit.  I still enjoy the song and it is still fun to listen to and has stayed with me.  I am sure the Talking Heads are going to record a version of this on their next CD.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  Some of the songs were good, some of the songs were mediocre, and some of the songs were terrible.  It's like listening to someone else's songs, only they sing them better than you can.  I'm not going to lie, I love Jewel.  I love her music.  I love her voice.  I love that she's an artist that is honest about her music and it affects me that she is an artist that is honest about it.  I love that she doesn't make her music fit a "safe" genre.  I really wish she'd come out with a few more new songs, but she has at least gotten a few more out there.  I don't know why she's not doing more of it, but I really wish she would.

I would have been happy with just 5 songs on this album.  I think she's got some good songs on here.  She's definitely got more songs than this album.  I haven't heard this album a second time in a long time, and I'm glad I listened to it again.  I'll be buying Jewel's new CD in a couple of weeks.

Amazon review: This album is just a great recording of her music.  There are only a couple of songs that are really bad, but the majority of the songs are great.  The songs are great, and they all have a consistent feel to them.  What makes Jewel's music really stand out is the fact that she has amazing musicianship.  These guys are good.  It's obvious they play their instruments well.  They can play almost any style of music, and they can do it without a problem.  I was worried that they would do a song that was a little different or a little too slow, but they played them in perfect time and in a way that really made the songs stand out.  The songs are great, the vocals are great, and I love the musicianship.  I'm glad I bought this CD over the years.  I've been buying Jewel's albums since 1998, and the only CD I've been able to get to is this one.  I just love this album.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: Nice.  It's a nice compilation.  It's a little off the wall.  However, I do like the song "The Green Dragon" (and the album is worth checking out if you've never heard it).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of early, alternative, post-punk bands.  I love them, and I would say that this is a very good compilation of some of the best.  The band that I am most fond of is the one that I am reviewing today.  I am not a huge fan of this band though.  I like them though, and I liked their album, I Love You All, which I am reviewing today.  I would have to say that this is something that I will never ever listen to, and I am sure that I will be able to listen to this song on my own without any problem.  But I feel that I would like to listen to it and other songs on my own.  However, the song "The Green Dragon" is not very good.  I must say that I thought that it was very good, but it is not as good as the album, I Love You All.  This is not their best work, but it is definitely their best work.  I am not sure what the problem is with this song.  They are very good at what they do, and I am sure that they are very good at what they do.  I would still say that this is a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album just to listen to it.  I think I was a little disappointed.  I guess I was expecting more from this band.  I was very disappointed.  I have bought their albums from this compilation before, and I love them, but I will not be buying this one.  I will stick with their other albums.  I am glad that I bought this one though.  I feel that it was worth the money.  I think it is a nice compilation of some of their better songs.  I really like the band, I think they can be very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: All good songs here.  Some good punk rock, some great.  Overall, the only thing that bugs me about this is the fact that I bought the whole collection and wasn't able to listen to the songs in any order I wanted.  I guess the problem was that I only had a couple of hours to listen to it.  I would still say that this is a good compilation, but not one that will be very popular with anyone except my music collection.  I will stick with the other albums.  I liked the first one better.  I think that this is an extremely good compilation, and I do hope that some one else will like it as well.  I also hope that some one else will be as disappointed as I was.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of this band.  I think it is okay, but there is not much here to like.  I think that this is a great compilation of some of their best songs.  The one song that really bugs me is "Abandoned", which has been bugging me for a long time.  I think that they are really good, but I think that this song really bugs me.  I think that it is very bad.  Some other songs are good, but again, only if you hear them in order.

Amazon review: I am in a really bad mood.  I really don't like this band.  I don't know why.  It's very loud.  I don't like loud music.  It's not that I don't like loud music, I just don't like it when it is too loud.  I know that I can't take it with me.  I don't like this band.  I mean, the other bands are great, but maybe they are going to be around for a long time, so I am not going to change my mind.  I would really like to like this band.  I really like this song, "The Blackout".  I like the album, I Love You All.  I don't think that it is too much to ask that they make a good album.  I really like their album, I Like It Loud, which I reviewed just recently.  I really like the album.  I think it is a good one.  It has good songs.  I don't know what the problem is with this song.  I think that the problem is that I don't really like it.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
