Amazon review: This is one of the better collections out there. Some very hard to find songs on this wonderful 3 cd set. Comes in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these days. Most multi-cd set cases are flimsy and fall apart quickly. Not this one. This is a bargain. It seems that the previous review was for the wrong CD.

Amazon review: I have been searching over the last two months to find a good set of Beach Boys songs. This is it. I'm so glad I found it. I have listened to it over and over and never get tired of it. The only songs I have ever heard that are better than these are "Surfin' U.S.A.", "Good Vibrations", and "California Girls". I have the album "The Beach Boys" and I will purchase the CD's of the other albums. I love the CD's. I can't wait to listen to the other songs. I love listening to the Beach Boys. The new CD is much better than the previous one I received.

Amazon review: Terry Kath in his heyday jamming over a funky vamp before transitioning into Bobby Lamm's bluesy ballad.  Loud, raw, and improvisational Gibson S-G handiwork make this tune my favorite early Chicago piece of work, circa, 1969.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I pre ordered this record, so you can imagine the amount of excitement I had when it arrived. I was all but kissed the delivery man when it came! I ran straight up to my record machine and played it, probably around 3 times before giving poor dierks a break. I listened to the record about 5 times after that before the unthinkable happened. "It's different for girls" began to SKIP! I was in shambles! On my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was skipping!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "It's different for Girls" (I know they like girls, but I have a problem with this type of music) was one of my favorite songs on the record, "In the Air Tonight" was a close second, and "My City" was an early favorite. They all have something to offer that I enjoy. I will be picking up the next from their catalog.

Amazon review: I was excited to get my hands on the new Van Halen CD.  I like most of the new material on this CD, but I just wasn't sure about "It's Always You".  I was pretty upset at first when I heard it skip about three times.  When I got it back, I was in shock to find that it doesn't skip.  I still don't know why they play so much and I don't understand why they change the playing style so much from song to song.  I find it annoying when I am playing their songs and it seems like they are not playing them correctly.  I would like to see them play a song like "It's Always You", but I guess they won't.  If you are a fan of Van Halen, this is a must have.

Amazon review: As much as I can scream out Expletives about the GRRRRRREATNESS of QAF the show, the soundtrack falls sadly mediocre.  It touts itself as ALMOST LIKE being in BABYLON (a dancejoint that does not exist in real life), well I guess it does in a way, but it doesn't capture the whole feel of BABYLON. I was expecting remixes and stuff!  WHERE IS IT? On the whole I guess its an O.K. compilation.  A lot of you won't really get what I am saying but, that's okay too.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know it's not going to be a regular, but I thought I'd give you one of the best tracks for the day.  I am a big fan of this band.  The sound quality is great, and the lyrics are really inspiring.  I encourage you to check them out and give their music (and their album) a listen.

Amazon review: Yes, the lyrics are a little out there.  Yes, this is not a very good song.  But if you are into an alternative/indie rock/metal type of music, this is not a bad choice.

Just a little to harsh.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Another great Elton John album.  I love this album for the reason that it has a very Elton John edge. I find it to be much more interesting than the other two albums he has done in the past. I would say that this is his most "Elton John" album, which is ironic because he was supposedly one of the most "Elton John" people in the world.  Still a good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The Fox is a great comeback album.  It's very emotional, but it is not that sad.  There are some really good songs on it, but its not really a "happy" album.  I love the songs "The Fox" and "The Fox Has a Cold" and "Rock of the Westies".  "Elvis in Me" is probably my favorite track on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  Its not my favorite Elton John album, but it is a well done album.  It has some of the best songs on it. "The Fox" and "Elvis in Me" are good, but they are not as great as some other songs like "I Don't Wanna Be a.  Star" and "The Song Is Over" or "Crocodile Rock".  Other songs aren't as good as "I Don't Wanna Be a  Star" and "Crocodile Rock".  "Rock of the Westies" is a close second to "I Don't Wanna Be a.  Star."  "The Fox Has a Cold" is a great song and it makes me want to sing along.  The last song "The Fox" is a great way to close the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The  Fox is a very good album.  It has the classic Elton John sound.  The songs are very very good, but not as good as some of his other albums.  Most of the songs have a very deep feeling to them and its very sad and emotional.  The song "Rock of the Westies" is a very good song.  The song "Elvis in Me" is also a very good song.  "The Fox" is a song that is not on the album.  The last song "The Fox" is just a great song.  "The Fox Has a Cold" is also a good song.  I enjoy the album and it makes me feel good.  Its not my favorite Elton John album, but it is well done and very good.

Amazon review: The book Think & Grow Rich is a must own. It is book to be read multiple times. That being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone. He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Leann used to have a great voice and was a likable talent.  Not anymore.  I cannot understand  the words she is singing and the album is not very good.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.

It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

I am sure that some of the songs will get old after they have been on the radio for a while, but I am sure that they will be favorites for me.  I am sure that Leon will try to capture the true essence of the songs, or at least I am sure that he will try.  I am sure that I will be impressed again and I will buy his next album.

Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.

Amazon review: This is a CD of songs from the Broadway musical Hair, written and sung by Paul Simon.  The selection consists of a variety of songs.  There is no indication of the song selection other than the title.  As a result, the songs are not uniformly varied.  However, they are uniformly interesting and not all awful.  The tracks are not terribly good but they are okay.  The CD could have been better if they'd chosen better songs, I suppose.

I would think that if this were a kid's musical, they would have made it fun and different, but no.  If I were to select a musical I'd say The Sound of Music.  But, I'm not that lucky.  This is a movie musical.  There's nothing good about it.  It's not even a good musical.  There's nothing interesting about it.  It's not a very good movie musical.  It's a boring musical.  I don't know what it's supposed to teach the kid, but it doesn't.  There's not a whole lot of story and there's not much of a plot.  There's no tension.  The story line is very lame, no surprises, and not very funny.  This is a musical that's like a movie musical without the fun.  This is not a musical that I would have chosen as a child, but as an adult, I would have chosen a movie musical.  That's all there is to it.

Amazon review: I am truly a J-Hud fan and have waited for this cd forever. It was a truly let down for me with a few exceptions If it isn't love, My heart, I'm his only woman, Invisible and naturally Spotlight best song on the cd! I'm shocked that this is what Clive Davis had in mind for her. Even though Kelly Clarkson's My December had one hit on it and Davis told her to start over and she said no. I'd rather Jennifer to of done it her way then his. But I still love ya Jenn hopefully better next time!

Amazon review: It's unfortunate that there isn't a negative rating scale. The disc took five weeks to arrive. Both the sound quality and the renditions of the songs were abysmal, even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging. Recycled the day it arrived.

Amazon review: I have two of these cds.  The first one came and I thought it was great.  I was a little nervous about buying this cds because I thought they were too poppy/rocky for my tastes.  After listening to this cd, I realized that they were a little more mature and less poppy.  I think they are just a great band and they are a little underrated.  I love the lyrics and the harmonies are great.  The song "Paranoid Android" is my favorite on the cd.  The second one is a little more rock and I love it.  I think it is a great cd for the new year!

Amazon review: Lorraine feather is the complete package.  Here are incredible intelligence and uniqueness, beautiful voice, wide-ranging moods and arrangements.  Always surprising and satisfying.  You must hear Lorraine Feather to believe it can be this good.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's a pretty song, with great vocals, but I'm not sure about the lyrics/message. Once I downloaded and listened to it in it's entirety I was displeased- sounds rather morbid to me. Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas. Is it just me, or do the selections this year seem kind of lousy thus far? I really enjoyed this 25 days of free downloads advent-type "calendar" last year.

Amazon review: This CD was bought by mistake by me, doh! So you know, this is a different guy. I guess if you like cheesy R&B/rap lite, it's ok.  Couldn't get through the 2nd song myself- Sure he looks different, but thought it was early & a bad pic, haha- Oh well. buy both of the'real' Sean Rowe CDs or LPs, they are KILLER!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not sure why I didn't check this one out at first, but it's one of the most popular tracks on my e-zine/blog, so I'll probably check it out more.  I really like the vibe and theme of the song, but some of the lyrics/message is a bit confusing to me.  I'm not sure what the point of the song is really, but it's definitely a great song.  Good for a change- it's about the concept of change, but I don't really understand the message.  Well, maybe next time- it's not a bad song, I just don't know why I should like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm surprised they've managed to keep this CD going for over 30 years.  Still not sure about the song itself, it's a catchy danceable R&B number, or whatever they call it nowadays.  I'll probably buy it, just because it's a CD, but I don't know if it's worth the money.  I guess it's a great song, but I don't know if it's worth the price.

If you're into R&B, you should listen to this- it's a good song, and it's a good message, and if you're into R&B, you should listen to this.  Very good.   Great song.

Amazon review: CSN, "Deja Vu", "After The Gold Rush". These were the albums that helped to define an era for some of us. "CSN" never supassed that first album, either collectively or individually though they did have some good songs on some albums. Neil Young was able to transcend the era, that is why he still is a vital recording artist. Nostalgia makes me sad. I don't need it.

Amazon review: Hello E.C. Fans, Just want to let fans know that this is NOT the full set. It's still missing the encores played that evening with Nick Lowe! If they are going to re-release this yet again,it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig. Just wanted to let people know,for an "archive " release that is a pretty shabby thing to do. Besides the fact, that the encores are really fun and feature some rare tunes. Hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time.

Amazon review: I downloaded this song based on the clip, without having any knowledge that there's a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur.  The spoken word portion has a good point that I agree with overall, but it renders this song unplayable in my household.  I wish I could return an MP3.  I'm utterly, utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning.  I now have serious doubts about downloading other song from Amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety.

Amazon review: Amazon is the worst.  I bought this album as part of a "Greatest Hits" package.  I was looking forward to listening to all of the songs as part of a new album.  But, Amazon would not let me download them in their entirety.  They want to charge me $25 for the songs and $25 for the album.  This is ridiculous. I didn't even pay for the whole album.  And, I'm not sure if they are sending a bill to my credit card, or what.  I'd like to take this opportunity to state that Amazon is a total rip off.   I don't know if they have any other albums, but I would suggest finding a way to cancel your account.

Amazon review: I want to like this album, but after listening to the first few tracks, it is as if the band decided to go back to the more straightforward music of the first few albums. It's a little disappointing to have to wait another 4 minutes to get to the song that I want most, "Don't Walk Away." I'd like to love a band that is at their best when they are at their most accessible.

Amazon review: I really like this album. The songs cover a wide variety of topics, and I love that there is not a one that is typical of the rest.  Although a lot of the songs are pretty easy to put together, some of the songs are a little hard to sing along to, and the vocals are a little too rough for my taste (the worst problem with this album, IMO).  Overall, I like it, and it is worth buying for the songs.  The only problem is that the songs don't quite go together, and I had to put the CD in the player twice to make it to the end of "All That I Need" due to an audio dead spot in the middle.

Amazon review: I received this CD a few months after it was released.  It is a compilation of songs that were in the radio station's rotation, and I thought this was a good idea.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this album.  The vocals are pretty much the same as those of the first album I purchased, with a few exceptions.  Although I loved the first album, I cannot stand the way that this one feels.  It sounds nothing like the first album, and it feels like there is not one song that feels like it belongs in the first album.  I really like the songs that I do hear, and I really feel that this album could have been a hit if it sounded different.  I guess that is the only thing that I can complain about about it, because it is hard to find great music that is "different."  I would recommend this album to anyone, just to be sure it sounds like the first album, but not to any who think that a more standard radio station would be a hit.

Amazon review: This is a super rare, super cool CD, with special features that will blow your mind!  I wanted to give this a positive review, but first, I must mention that I do not own the original album (I own the first album, and it's also super rare).  I did get this CD as a gift, and I have to say that I did not want to put it back on the shelf.  This is an amazing album, and the special features are incredible.  There is a full length demo of a song from the album, a 2 song demo of another song, and the song on this album that you have probably already heard, but I would like to tell you why you may not.  The song I'm referring to is "Love and Lies," which I found on Amazon.com, but if you have not heard it, its on Amazon.com for almost $50.  That just makes me so mad.  The song is pretty much a rehash of the songs from the first album that I already have.  The only thing that would make it better would be if they did not have the same sound as the first album, and if those songs were on there, they would sound different.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I love that I can relate to these songs.  They are a lot of fun to sing along to.  I am not familiar with the band, so I did not know who to listen to.

Amazon review: On this CD you'll only find side A of the original album "Skin Diver Suite", side B is not included. Too bad. Plus: It's taken from vinyl, not from the mastertape. I guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip.

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the CD mostly because it is a re-master version of the original band's album.  It has a nice sound, but the songs do not go forward.  The singer sounds more like a girl, and the music is pretty generic.  The instrumentation is very generic, and not as much as on the first CD.  I think this disc sounds like it was recorded at a party, and then thrown onto a small portable CD player.

Amazon review: This CD was put out by a group called "The Hottest Band in the World".  It's a song that could have been a hit single.

It's not as good as "Brown Eyed Handsome Man" or "Folsom Prison Blues."  They are all great songs and a lot of people consider them the best.  I agree but I can't say that this is one of those great ones.  It's not great.  It's on par with "The Other Side Of Sunday."  I don't know that it is.  It's not bad.  I wouldn't say that it is great.

It will remind you of "Tom Goad", which I actually own but have not seen since the first and only time I played it.

Amazon review: I heard a live performance of the Imagine Dragon's and really enjoyed the music, so I ordered the album. The album unfortunately is a huge disappointment. The mastering of this album is terrible. A number of the songs on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect. When you hear the songs live, the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance. But on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music.

Amazon review: After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.  Also, you get to hear his more "straight up" distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly, stylized singing style on many of his recordings (not that there's anything wrong with that!) It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

A:

I'm with the OP on this one.  I am a country music fan and I've come to expect a certain level of quality in the music that I buy.  I don't see the need to have a country album that is half country songs and half new songs.  
I've never heard ANYTHING from this album:
"I'm not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set." 
Well, it's true.  It's not a country album.  It's not even a country group album.  It's a collection of "old" songs from that era.  Some of them are well done.  I like the cover art.  I like the way the songs are arranged.
But I don't like the singer:
"I don't like the singer." 
I don't know if he's the best singer in the world, but I don't think he's the worst.  He's certainly not bad, but he's not the best.  I don't like the way he sings - but I don't think that's a reason to toss this album off the shelf.  I don't think he's the worst singer in the world.  I'm not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this album.  Maybe a record company executive.  But I don't understand how anyone could think that it is a good idea to have a country album that is half country songs and half new songs and a collection of old songs from that era.  I don't think it's even a country album.  It's a collection of "old" songs from that time.  I don't think that's what country music is all about.  If you're going to have a collection of old songs, at least bring them up to speed with the current trends in the music industry.  
I don't like the way this album is arranged.  I don't think it's any more country than the way the songs are arranged.  I don't like the singer.  I don't like the cover art.  I don't like the way the songs are arranged.  I don't like the singer, but I don't think that's a reason to toss this album off of the shelf.  I don't think he's the worst singer in world.  I'm not sure who came up with the ridiculous track list for this album.  Maybe a record company executive.  But I just don't understand how anyone could think that it's a good idea to have a country album that is half country songs and a collection of old songs from the time period.  I don't think it's even a country album.  I'm not sure who came up with the ridiculous track list.  Maybe a record company executive.  But I just don't see what the big deal is.  I don't think he's the worst singer in the world, but I don't think he's the best.  He's certainly not bad, but he's not the best either.  I don't
