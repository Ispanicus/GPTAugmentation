Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon's customer service is not worth the price.  When you cancel or get a refund, do NOT send a check.  Send an email (with the order #) to Amazon.  I got an email saying I had received a refund.  I did not get a check.  But I did get a nice letter from Amazon stating why I was out of luck.  I guess they have nothing else to do but cry.

Amazon review: Great album.  The only song I don't like is "When the Cat Meets the Dog."  The song is good but the lyrics are not exactly my cup of tea.  But for the most part, this is a good album.  I bought it for $1.99 I think.  I had to take a second look at the album cover because I was expecting a photo of a cat and a dog.  I like it.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the first single, "My Mind's on Vacation," every morning for the past week.  I listen to her in my car and when I am in my office.  She can sing and she can sing with a good song.  But I am not sure I like her voice.  She may need to change her vocal chords and add some vibrato.  Or maybe change her singing style.  It is as if she has a voice that needs a different style.  I like the song, but it is not really a song that is going to make me buy her album.  All I can say is that I hope she does not get discouraged and take a break.  I like her voice.

Singer Natalie Cole died peacefully of anorexia at the age of 36. She was found in her home in Los Angeles on Sunday. Her publicist confirmed the news to the Associated Press.

Cole sang with the New York Philharmonic, the Cleveland Symphony and many others. She was also a producer who worked with artists like Beyonce, Rihanna, and Michael Jackson. She sang on songs by Michael Jackson, Jay-Z, Christina Aguilera and many others.

Cole was awarded three Grammy Awards, in 1995, for her work with the New York Philharmonic. She also received a Grammy in 2001 for her work with Christina Aguilera in the song, "Fighter."

In 2001, she was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

She sang on many albums, including Aaliyah's, If I Was Your Woman. She sang on the soundtrack for the movie, The Wedding Singer, singing "Unchained Melody".

She also recorded her own songs including "Heaven" and "Lorena".

Cole sang many gospel songs.

Cole was in a relationship with her husband, Marc Anthony.

She had been working on a memoir, "Wishful Drinking."

She had a daughter, Kaitlyn, and a son, Jayden.

Cole's career was cut short after her death. She was on her way to appear on the Late Show with David Letterman, when she was found in her Los Angeles home. She was found with a plastic bag over her head and had a plastic bag over her body.

Her death was ruled an accident.

Cole was best known for her gospel-influenced recordings.

Cole is survived by her two children, Kaitlyn and Jayden. Her husband, Marc Anthony, was reported to be in a relationship with a singer, Ciara, and a former reality TV star, Kelly, and died in late August.

I'm not sure how many of you are aware of the fact that there are already about 5 million copies of this book out there in the world, and that every year another 5 million or so are released, and then another 10 million or so are released.

So my question is this: Is the demand for this book going to be met? And more importantly, is it going to be met by the same people who already own this already published book? Or does this book need to be re-released? It is already in the public domain.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This is a great song with an amazing chorus.  The only problem is its a lot of the songs have multiple lines of lyrics.  They are extremely repetitive and just make the song feel the same.  If you want more songs with lots of lines, this is the one to get.  But don't get it until they start writing more original lyrics.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Review: Korn III is the third album in the band's trilogy. It was originally released in 1995, although it was preceded by the 1996 EP, The Path of Totality and followed by 1999's The Nothing. It is the band's strongest release to date, but the album is not without flaws. The album's centerpiece is the track "In the Air Tonight". The track was released as a single in the United States in 1996, but only reached number fifty on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The song was included on the Best of Korn compilation, which was released in 1996. It peaked at number fifty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The album's other highlight is "Gone, Gone, Gone," a track that has been described as Korn's "crowning achievement". The song has been described as having elements of the band's sound from their first two albums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Review: I have listened to all three Korn albums and this is my favorite of the three. This album is a great listen and you learn a lot about the band. I feel like this album is the best of the three. I like the songs, Korn is still a great band and this is the best song they have put out. Great album.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Korn and I am glad to have discovered them. I have a hard time getting past the first few albums. I never liked the first one and I was worried that the band would be gone by the end of the second album. But I got to this one and I have to say that Korn III is the best album of the three. This album is the best of the three in my opinion. I feel like they have really stepped it up from the first two albums. The album is a little short but the album is still very very good and still has elements of the first two albums. I would highly recommend this album to anyone.

I don't understand why they put this CD in a box with plastic and a piece of paper that says it is new.  They should put a cardboard box.  I expect them to put a cardboard box for this CD.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I got this CD in the mail today.  So far,  it's got a few good tracks, but I'm not really into it.   I can listen to it on a long drive on a flat tire, but that's about it.   I think the real problem is that it is a rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, and rap.   There is no lyrical progression or anything.   It's like they are just getting ready to release an album with a bunch of songs and they've already put out three.   I'm not really into rap.   I think I like rock better.  I think that's why I like this album.  The songs are good, but I just can't get into it.  I think I'm just not hip to what they're doing.   I'm not really into rap,  and this is one of their best pieces of work.  I think it's good, but I can't really get into it.

Amazon review: My mom loves music.  She has been exposed to music her whole life.   She is the type of person who loves music.   There's nothing wrong with that.   But when someone gets a hold of her and starts playing music for her, she gets excited and excited.   Her excitement is not always musical.   She has a wonderful voice and she loves to sing,  but she has also experienced negative emotions and has gone through a lot in her life.  The music that she loves the most is country music.   She's always wanted to learn more about country music.   She's been on the radio a few times and has not yet gotten to learn about country music.   She's been listening to the radio,  but she's still not sure what she's really listening to.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for the past few days.  I like the tracks.  I don't like the lyrics.  I think they are a little over-the-top.   But I like the songs, and I like the music.   Unfortunately,  the lyrics are not very positive.

Amazon review: I have only listened to this CD once.  I bought it to hear the new "Gangsta" by "Big Pun".   I didn't like either of them.   I think the singer does a very good job.   In my opinion,  the music is not that great.  Maybe it's not what I wanted to hear, but sometimes you need to be a little more critical.   Maybe I should have listened to something else.

Amazon review: Not sure what I expect from this box.  It must have been an excellent package before opening it.  After opening the box, the first thing that comes to mind is 'I should have opened this with a knife'.  The box is not that large.  My box was a little big to fit in my mailbox.  The original package is a little larger.  At first I thought it was a CD or CD case.  But then I realized the box (or box) was a lot bigger than the record.  And it was wrapped in a very nice and thick brown paper.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am glad I decided to check this out.  It sounded good and the price was right.  You would think that this box would be a little larger.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  I am going to give it to her when she is old enough.  The only thing is that the sound is a little different from the original vinyl.

But she likes it and it is easier for me to put on the table.

Amazon review: I like the sound of this record.  It is clear, crisp, and has a nice quality to it.  It can be played on a normal record player, but it sounds better when it is on a little electronic device.  My only complaint is that I wish it came on both sides of a record.  I like being able to flip it over.  I think the packaging is nice, but it would have been nice if it came with a CD for the record.  I think a CD would look better as well.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: "The first half is a tribute to music from one of my favorite composers, Richard Wright.   Richard Wright was one of the greatest musicians I have ever known,  and he was also one of the greatest composers I have ever known.  He was the first musical genius I really listened to  and the first person who I can truly say I could listen to, as well as write music to.  He was the first musician that I fell in love with, and he was the first musician I ever wrote to.  He was one of the most original composers I've ever heard and one of the most musical.  He was the first person to write songs that took me on an emotional rollercoaster ride, to the point where I wanted to die.  He was the first person to make music that made me feel like I was losing control.  He was the first person to make music that made me feel that I finally understood what it was to be human.  He was the first person to  write songs that left me in awe at how good they were, and the first to make songs that left me in awe at how great they were.  He was the first person to write songs that took me on a journey with his music,  and the first to make songs that took me on a journey with his music.  He was the first person to write songs that made me feel like I was in a band with him,  and he was the first person to make songs that made me feel like I was in a band with him.  He is just one of the most amazing musicians  that I have ever encountered in my entire life.  He is just one of the most amazing musicians that I have ever encountered in my entire life.  His music was so amazing that it took me years to fully comprehend how incredible it was.  It took me years to feel like I understood what it was like to be in a band with him."

Amazon review: This is a tribute album to the most beloved singer/songwriter of all time, Bob Dylan.   There are many great singers or musicians but Dylan was my first.  I was a young country-born American girl living in the suburbs,  attending a big public high school, and had a crush on Dylan.   One day, I was walking down the road, when some guy stopped me and asked me to sing with him.  I accepted,   and we walked to a small wooded area where I got to sing, and he sang along to my lyrics.  He was my first real friend,  and he became a mentor to me.  I loved his music, and I loved him.  I have always listened to him, and I have listened to his music since I was five or six.   I have always loved him.   I was able to pick up the guitar when I was 10 or 11,  and I played in the church band with some of the boys from my school.  Dylan was always playing in the church band.   I loved his music, and I loved him.   I was able to pick up the guitar when we were teenagers, and I played in a very small, very local, country band that lasted a little over two years.   As I was moving out of our town into the suburbs of a big town,   Dylan and I started playing in some small clubs and coffee houses in the suburbs.   We played in a few coffee houses and small clubs, and he put on some very interesting shows, and I was able to get to know him,  and to hear him.   One night,  he invited me to go out to see his shows, and I was very excited,  because I had already met him, and I had learned what he was all about,  and I thought he might be a great friend.   I had a great time,  and it was a great experience.   He and I kept in touch,   and we would talk and play music,   and he would sing, and I would sing with him.   We met each other at different points in our lives,  and I learned from him,  and he taught me a lot.   I took lessons from him and learned more from him.   I played in his band for several years,  and I learned more from him, and he taught me a lot.   I was very happy with the time that I spent with him,  and I was very happy with the music that I played with him.  I was very happy with the time that I spent with him.   He was very understanding and very supportive of my life and of my music.   He allowed me to be someone who was very close to him.
