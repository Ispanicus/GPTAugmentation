Amazon review: I bought this to replace my old "Journey" album, and it sounds great.  This is the first CD I've heard where I've heard the whole album twice, and it sounds even better the second time around.  I love the band.  I like the music.  But this is not a "hit" album.  The songs don't stand out.  The songs are good, but I don't think I'll ever be able to find the hit singles on any of the songs.  But it sounds great.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This was a good listen to. The first track was really good. The next one was a little boring and boring at the same time. I guess it was a song that was recorded in a studio and they mixed it the way they wanted it to sound. I like the fact that he has a big voice. It is good to know that he sings. I like that he does not put his voice too loud on the recordings. I like the way he sings the song. I think he is a good singer and he is not very good in the next song. The guitar playing was really good. The way he sang, he sang with no mistakes. The beat was also great. I was like a little kid listening to the song because I like the way he sang. I think in the future, he should do some more songs because he is really good. I like the way he has a voice. He can sing.

Amazon review: The sound quality on this album is exceptional. The instruments are clear and crisp and the vocals crisp and clear, as well. The overall sound is excellent for this listener, despite the occasional issue of a slightly flat or muted sound, for example during the guitar solos on the second track. Some of these issues are due to the way that the vocals were mixed, but in general, the sound is excellent, and the music is very well arranged.

Amazon review: Attunement has a nice sound. If you listen to the music, it sounds like they are playing the same thing over and over. Thats what a lot of bands do when they record.

The beauty and emotion that can be found in Brett Eldredge is one of the most impressive and rare qualities to be found in an artist.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: As a former Rancid fan, I had to be at the show for the first time this year, but unfortunately it was sold out and I couldn't get into the show.  My wife's friend is a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan and I asked her to buy tickets for us, but she didn't have any and that was the case for most everyone else at the show.  I then ran into a woman at the show who had seen me at the show at the arena and was able to give me the name of a guy who was trying to call her with the name of another person to try to get a ticket.  He was able to get us a ticket, which we got in the last moment before the doors opened.  I wish I could say that I had been in the front row, had my friends and family in the front row, and also had my wife's friend in the front row, but that was not the case so my wife's friend would not be able to say the same thing.  This was a good show, the Smashing Pumpkins had a great setlist, and the Pumpkins were fun to watch.  But the only thing that made this show any good was the fact that the Smashing Pumpkins were performing.  I would have liked to have seen the Rancid show, but it seemed as though they had a hell of a lot more going on than Smashing Pumpkins.

Amazon review: In the early 90's, Nirvana was the biggest thing in the rock world.  Now they are almost completely forgotten.  The band's last album, Nevermind, is still their best album, but they are really just a band that made a name for themselves and never found their place.  Nirvana was a good album, but no where near as good as their first album, Bleach, which is the only album that every Nirvana fan knows.  Nirvana's best album from the 90's was probably Nevermind, but they have nothing to offer for anyone who doesn't know their music.  Their one good album is the only album they made where they actually played every song on the album, which is what they should have done when they were starting out.  After Nevermind came out, they should have just stuck to making music that only they would listen to.  It is sad to hear that the only people who are now playing Nirvana are the fans who have bought their records in the past.  Now I feel like I know a lot of people who are not going to get the chance to see them live, because it seems as though they are so far on the end of the line now.  I know a lot of musicians who have gotten up and played one of their songs at their shows, but I don't know anyone who played a Nirvana song at their show.

Amazon review: If you've got a lot of time on your hands, you can listen to this on the ipod.  I don't know if that is the first time I have heard this song on the ipod, but it might be the first time I have listened to it on the ipod.  It's catchy, and the guitar and drums are on point.  The drummer is not the greatest drummer, but then again, if you are going to get someone who plays drums who is not the best at what they do and then make them play the drums as the lead instrument, you are doing something wrong.  But the bassist is also doing a pretty good job and the guitarists sound good.  I like this song.

Amazon review: On a completely different note, I was playing the guitar today.  It was a pretty good day to be outside playing the guitar.  I was on a sidewalk playing the guitar when I heard an engine start up and stop in front of me.  I looked over and there was a man in a truck driving by, but he didn't see me.  I continued to play the guitar, but kept my eyes on the truck.  I was able to keep playing for about five minutes, but then I looked over and saw the man in the truck coming toward me, so I got off the sidewalk and ran.  I have never seen a man in a truck drive by me in the past 20 years, but I have never seen one who didn't see me, so I was pretty safe.  I am not a great runner, so I don't know if they were going to see me or not, but I can assure you that if I were to get on the sidewalk and run in that direction, I would be dead.  I am a pretty good runner, which is why I am on the sidewalk.  I would be dead before I got halfway down the block if I ran down the street

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  The first two singles were good, especially the one that came out last year.  But the rest of the album is a let down.  I have to admit that I do not like the whole "White Boy Gangsta Rap" sound.  I would rather they were trying to be more metal or alternative or even some type of punk band.  This album is way too metal and alternative for my taste.  The only good thing is the bonus tracks.  I did not like the lyrics and thought that some of the tracks were very funny.  The bonus tracks are good and are worth the price of the CD.  If you like rap metal, "White Boy Gangsta Rap" sound, then you will like this album.  Otherwise, I would not waste your money.  I would recommend this album to people who are in the mood for rap metal.  But I still think that the rest of the album is just not worth the money.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review:  My wife is a big fan of the band and has always wanted to know why I didn't like their music.  I finally got around to listening to the new CD and it was disappointing.  The vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  I was hoping for a more aggressive sound, but I think the production is too over the top for the music to really work.  The band is a bit too over the top, and the production is too, as well.  The band sounds like they were given a bunch of cash, and told to record an album, and they had to do it to the best of their ability.  I would have preferred a more rock'n'roll sound.

Amazon review:  I was very disappointed by this recording.  The vocals were not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  There were some extremely loud parts that could have been used better for the orchestral parts.  The band sounded like they were given a bunch of cash, and told to record an entire album, and then had to do it to the best of their ability.  The vocals were not as prominent as the orchestral parts, and the music was too fast for the instrumentation to sound good.  The vocals reminded me of the "Weird Al" Yankovic.  I would not have bought it, but I am a bit of a music snob and I am embarrassed that I bought it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a great album.  I have never liked the band so much.  In fact, I have not liked them at all since the last album.  They are so bad in this recording that even with the original recordings, it is not as good as the other two albums.  They have no musical talent.  The vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts, and the music is not as good as the other two albums.  I would have liked to hear a better production.  I was disappointed in the way the vocals sounded.  The band sound like they were given a bunch of money, and told to record an album, and then had to do it to the best of their ability, and then were told they weren't talented enough to get the job done.  They sound amateurish.  The vocals didn't make an impact at all.

Amazon review:  I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of this band, but I have to say that I've come to really appreciate them since I discovered them.  They are always so good.  I've always wondered why they were so good, but I finally have an explanation.  I've always liked their music, but I have never been able to understand them.  Until now.  I'm not sure why I like them now, but it's all because of this new CD.  The new CD is great.  The band sounds great.  I didn't realize how much I had been missing out until I found this new CD.  I'm glad I bought it, and I'm glad that I did.  I was not disappointed.  The vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts (especially since I was not a huge fan of theirs in the past).  But the music is great.  I was really hoping for more of a rock'n'roll sound, but the band sounds like they were given a bunch of money, and told to record an entire album, and then had to do the best of their ability, and then had to be told that they weren't talented and couldn't make the music work, and then had to be told that they needed a producer, and then they had to do the job and then record it, and then the producers and the producers decided that the music just wasn't good enough and the band didn't do it, and the record company decided to re-record the album, and then re-issue the album, and then re-release the album, and then re-release the album, and then reissue the album, and then re-release the album, and then they finally get to see the record company, the band, and the fans and say, "Well....this is what we did, and we're glad we did it."

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

They are not bad songs, they are just not my kind of music.  I do not know what the band is trying to do, but they are trying to make it to country music, and they don't have the look or the sound that country music needs.  I would not recommend this album to those who like country music.  I just don't like this band.  I don't like them, but I really don't like their music.

I don't know how to explain it, but this album is just a great album.  My favorite song is the title track, "I'll Take You There."  It has a little country feel to it and is very good.  I also like the instrumentals on this album.  I don't know what the band is trying to do.  I like the songs.  I just don't like the band.  They are different, but I don't like them.

It makes me wonder, is there anything in the world that can't be described in a simple song?  I love this song and can't wait to see where it goes from here.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: This is a good album to get if you like '90s grunge bands.  It's hard not to like the whole concept of the band, but the music is kinda bland.  I can't help but feel like they put a bunch of songs together in a similar fashion and then just didn't care enough to make it something special.  Also, the vocals are all the same.  Not even close to being good.  The album is worth $2.99.  Maybe if I buy a few more CDs I'll like it.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of bands like Mudhoney, Rancid, and the band from the movie "Bad Boys".  I bought this album specifically because I have heard the band Mudhoney a lot on the radio and I like their music.  I didn't want to miss out on them.  I would say this album is better than most of the other grunge bands like Mudhoney and Rancid.  I bought this album to hear the band play live.  I think they sound great live.

Amazon review: This album is great and I wish it was more than the one song that is on it.  I bought the album with the intention of listening to the album on a drive to work every day.  I was happy when the one song was over.  Then I noticed that the album was over.  I think I'll just save the album for my next trip to the store.  This album will not stick out in my head.  It was pretty good.  It did have a few songs that I like.  That's about it.  The album is worth $2.99.

It's just some random songs that have been thrown together.  I will not buy this album again.  It is a waste of money.  I think I will pass on it.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

I have not been so lucky to see the show in years & I can't wait to see the show again.  BFS is back.  I have a few questions about the production of this album, how did you get the sound from your studio.  I have noticed there is a lot of echo, does it affect your vocals at all? Also, I have noticed some of the songs are a little off, I am not sure of the reason as to why, the song "Ladies Night" is off balance to the point where it sounds like the vocals are coming from the right instead of the left side of the microphone.  I am sure that this is just the studio environment, but I am glad to hear that you are still making great music.  Thank You.

Now I am looking forward to seeing them on stage again.  They are great and I will wait to hear the new album.  Thank you, and I love them.

Amazon review: So glad to have found the band who I have been listening to for years!  I love the way it sounds, the energy in the music, and the great songs!  Not to mention the fact that this album is awesome!  The first time I saw them on stage was in a small club in South Carolina, and it was worth the price of admission.  I can't wait for the new album.  I am a fan of this band and always has been.  I love the songs.  Now I am looking forward to seeing them on stage once again.  I love them and I am looking forward to the new album.  Thank you, and I love them.

I do not like the album because it has too many songs.  I also cannot stand how loud they dance on stage.  I am looking forward to the new album.  I love the music.  Now I am looking forward to seeing them on stage again. They are great and I will wait to hear the new album. Thank you, and I love them.

Amazon review: I like listening to Demi Lavato's music.  She is pretty good.  I bought it for my Kindle Fire HD.  You should like it too.

Amazon review: No Rocky Top?!?  Why bother?  That's like warm beer & cold pizza, close but not quite.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like Demi Lavato because she's a good songwriter and her voice is very beautiful.  I'd like to like her more, but the songs just aren't good enough for me to like them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Demi has talent.  She is an excellent songwriter.  She makes many, many pop songs (some of which are very sweet).  Her voice is beautiful and she has a great falsetto.  I love the Beatles and have listened to almost every song they have ever recorded.  Demi is one of my favorite singers and songwriters.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like Demi too.  She is a good singer.  She may not be a great songwriter.  She has a strong, beautiful voice and some of her songs are very emotional.  Her songs tend to be slower than most other artists.  But, she is a great singer and songwriter.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have bought Demi about 5 songs at this point.  She is great.  She is also a very good song and record writer.  I will definately buy more as time goes on.  She is a great singer, she's very unique and her voice is beautiful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like Demi Lavato's music and I have bought some as gifts for my daughter and I.  I have also bought some as gifts for myself.  Demi's voice is very beautiful, and she has a beautiful voice.  (I can say that because I have tried to imitate Demi's voice but I don't think I can do it well.)  Her songs are interesting (but you have to think about what she is singing.)  She has a lot of creativity.  She is very talented.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like some of Demi's songs.  I don't know if I'll buy all of her songs.  They are not very good.  I don't know why she is always singing in Spanish or English, but that is what she does.  There are some very good songs here...some are very creative and some are just good songs.  I would like to like Demi more...I think she is a very good artist.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have purchased a few Demi Lavato songs and listen to them but I don't like all of them.  Some of her songs are very good...some aren't.  Demi Lavato is good at what she does.  She is not a very good songwriter and she doesn't like singing in English.  It is not her fault...she is not used to singing in a language other than Spanish or English and she is sometimes singing the same song in different languages.  She is also very good at writing love songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the music Demi Lavato writes.  I think she writes some very good songs.  Some of them may not be very good.  Demi Lavato has a very beautiful voice.  She sometimes sings a song twice.  I think (and I may be wrong) that she sings in her native language.  There are also songs that contain parts that sound like someone else singing, so...
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like Demipagalicious.  She is very talented, she has a beautiful voice.  I like her singing.  She has some very good songs.  Some of her songs are very creative...some of them are just good songs.  I think she is a good singer.
