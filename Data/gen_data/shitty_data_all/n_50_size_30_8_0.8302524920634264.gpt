Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I was a fan of the RZA, and he was a fan of the Wu Tang Clan, I figured if I could get a CD with the Wu's I could get the RZA for the RZA.  But the RZA is pretty busy these days.  In addition to his own music, he has been working on a documentary with Wu-Tang's leader, RZA.   I listened a few tracks from this CD and I think what makes this album really good is that while it is still the Wu, it is not afraid to use the RZA as well as the Wu.  I think it is hard to compete with the Wu.

Amazon review: This compilation contains most of the music from the "Wu Tang Clan album" (and a few songs from the Wu) and a few from the RZA.  Some of the RZA's songs are a little over the top, such as "Lovin' You Too Much," but the songs are all good.   The only negative I would say is the vocals.  They are very weak and are the same all over the CD.  The CD has good production quality with decent sound.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation!  It has all of the music from the "Wu Tang Clan Album" and "The Wu" and "RZA's" solo albums.   I am disappointed that the RZA is only on one track.

I would give this compilation 5 stars if I could.

Amazon review: "The Wu" is one of the best rap albums of all time.   I have owned this CD for several years and it continues to get better and better.

Amazon review: Wu-Tang Clan is one of the most popular rap groups in the world.    The group has a great variety of music and they are always growing and evolving.   The best thing about this CD is the music.   The group has always had a big variety of music and this CD shows they are still going strong.   The group is a very good combination of hip hop, R&B and a little bit of jazz.   The group does not have any real singles.   This CD came out in 1999, so many albums came out before or after this CD.   But this CD is one of the most solid albums of the group.   I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Wu-Tango's music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review:  I bought this after some very negative reviews of it, and I was so excited about it I almost bought it without listening to it first.  I really enjoyed the music, and it has a very different sound from Title, but I still can't get past the fact that the lyrics are quite similar to Title's.  It's still worth checking out, but not for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I think this album is one of the best albums of 2015. The first song is a song I really enjoyed, and it was perfect for a rainy day. The lyrics are very inspiring, and it's a great, uplifting album.  I loved the style, and loved the music. I am not a fan of the sound, but it's definitely worth a listen.  The only thing that could've made it better would be to make a different song choice (I know that was a suggestion in my review).  Oh well, you can't please everybody.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of Meghan Trainor's music since her first song "The Climb" came out in 2009. She is one of my favorite singers. I have bought her music in the past, this was my first time buying her album. I can't put my finger on why she is not getting the recognition she deserves.  I'm not trying to be rude, but please look at her as a singer and not just a songwriter. She is a great musician and songwriter, and her voice is amazing. I just can't get behind the fact that she is "unrecognized" and I hope that changes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I had no idea what to expect when I heard this album. I was not at all disappointed in it. I listened to it in one sitting, and it was a pleasant experience. The lyrics are beautiful, and I'm glad to have found a new Meghan Trainor album, as she is certainly a great singer. I don't disagree with anyone that said it was a little too typical of her music, but I definitely enjoyed it. It was worth the money, and I highly recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I was surprised by the music style.  It was a lot closer to a country/bluegrass sound then the other two albums.  I really enjoyed the first song, and I think the rest of the album was also good.  The songs are not as good as Title and Meghan's other albums, but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes either bluegrass, country, or folk music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I really enjoyed this album, but I still don't love it.  I still think this is too similar to Title, but I am also happy to have found something new to listen to.

It has a lot of heart and is worth a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  One of the best albums of 2015.  The lyrics and music are just so beautiful.  I think this is Meghan Trainor at her best.  I am not a country fan, but I have to say she does a great job of writing great lyrics and singing in a great voice.  I don't understand why this is not getting more recognition.  It's just a really good album, and I really enjoyed it. I hope Meghan does another album like this, and I hope it gets more recognition.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I enjoyed this album.  The songs are catchy and the album has a great sound.  I think it was a little too predictable, but I liked it.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is not as good as Title, or as good as Meghan's other albums.  Title would be my choice, and Meghan would be my choice.  I can't think of any reason why this album is not getting more recognition.  I was surprised by the production, but I do like it.  The lyrics are not as good as Title's, and the song choices are not as good as Title's.  I don't think this album deserved to be put on my list, but I did it

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I don't like this album at all. I think this guy is a fraud. I like a lot of songs, but this one is just not for me. The songwriting is not that good, and it's not that good. It's boring.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this album. I don't feel the songs are that great. I like the fact that some songs have different instrumentation, but that's about it. I don't know why this guy is trying to push his new style of music. There's no new ideas, and the lyrics are really bad.

Amazon review: I've listened to Meghan Trainor's songs and this is the best album by her. There's not much new to this album, but I am really enjoying it. The songs are really good and I really love the voice of Meghan. I've listened to the album 3 times and still don't like it.

Amazon review: I love Meghan Trainor's music. It's a great combination of new and known songs. I love all the songs on this album. I also do not like the way this album is released. It's not like there was one song that was put out first, and that's it, and then the rest of the songs was put out at a later date. Each song is in it's own file. If this had been released on time, it would have been better. The songs are good. The vocals are good. The sound is good. Overall, it's a good album.

Amazon review: This was a very good purchase.  The songs are very well done. The harmonies are great. It was a great album. The only thing is that I would like to have a word with the people that made the recording because they are making my head hurt and my eyes hurt.  I have just purchased more of their albums.  I like to make the choice on what I get based on my own personal preferences. My problem is that I like a lot of the music that I hear and I don't listen to the radio and therefore I am buying a lot of their products. I would much rather buy a product that I like that's unique to my taste than a product that I can't even stand to look at. I don't mind paying a small amount of money for something I really like, but I would like to know who the artist is because I don't want to buy a product that I don't like.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Just purchased this for my wife.  She's got a bad hip that makes her limp (like a horse) and is having a hard time playing the piano.  As she's playing I'm thinking about what I'd like to say to her to get her out of that funk.  (I guess I'm not very well spoken).  As I walk by the piano I listen to this CD, and I get the idea.  Then I walk back, and I'm like, "What the hell happened to this song?  What the hell happened to this guy?  What the hell happened to that song?"  And then I realize that I don't have the guts to say what's on my mind.  I just walk by and say, "Hey, I'm sorry that I'm not a very good singer."  "No, no," she says, "Don't you dare apologize!  You're one of the best."  I'm proud to be a guy that can find the good in things.

I've been there many times, and it is one of the worst places in the world to be.  I'm sitting in the waiting room, and the only thing I can think to do is stop by this new CD from Revel.  I'd never heard of them and thought I'd try to take some time off from work to relax and listen to music.  I'd heard that they were a rock band, but that's not what I got.  They're a jazz band that plays "cable" music with a jazz feel.  The music is really well done, and they have some great players.  My wife is really enjoying the music too.  I hope she gets better.

Amazon review:  I just recently returned from a trip to Italy.  I was trying to get to Venice, but I was stuck in the traffic for 20 or 30 minutes because of the rain and a stupid breakdown.  I was in a bad mood because I was driving the wrong way up a mountain.  As I'm listening to this CD, the memory of the rain and the breakdown in traffic flashes through my brain.  I can't remember the lyrics to the song, but I remember the sound of the rain and the rain.  I can't get that image out of my head.  I don't think I ever felt so miserable in my life.  I know I was driving the wrong way and I was frustrated.  I just had to get to Venice.  The rain and the traffic and the memory of the bad mood and the depression and the frustration and the memory of the memory of the bad mood with the memory of the memory of the bad mood.  And then, the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory, with the memories of the memories of the memories of the memories of the memories of the memories, of the memories, of the memories, of the memories.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: There were a few notes in the bass in the bass and the treble that were a bit too loud and I couldn't hear them well.  The main thing I liked about this CD was the bass though.   They had a nice balance and were not overpowering.  There were a few times I could hear what I was listening to, but not the main parts of the song (bass, treble, etc.).

Amazon review:  This is a great example of classical music.  The sound is excellent, and the piano work is very good.  I enjoyed the way the piano is mixed in the background and what comes from the piano.  The piano has a little bit to much in the background, but overall this CD is really good.  It has a little bit of everything in it.

Amazon review:  I am not a big fan of this CD.  I don't like when they take piano or other instruments into the background.  I think that is boring.  I would have preferred the piano to come out at the front of this album instead of the background.   As a whole this is a good album.   I really enjoyed listening to this.  It has a good mix and sound.  The only thing is that I don't necessarily like the way they mixed the music.  I would have preferred the sound come out more at the front of the album, and not in the background.  I also don't like when there is piano and other instruments mixed in the background.  The piano is annoying sometimes, but I am not too sure why.   Overall, I think this is a good album.  I would like to hear more music like this from this artist.   It has good beats and sounds to me.  I would recommend this CD to people who enjoy good classical music.   I would say it's a good recommendation.   It's good to be able to listen to classical piano music for a change.  I would say it's a good recommendation.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

This album is a must for any black woman or black man.

Amazon review: This is one of the best jazz albums, I have heard in a long time.  I have heard almost all of Lin Manuel Miranda's albums and this is his best. The lyrics are superb on this album, and the music is just as good if not better. Lin Manuel Miranda's music has become so much more personal and lyrically more impactful. He plays with the same style and instrumentation that he uses on all of his albums, but he has added a more personal touch to his music.

Amazon review: This is the best album I have listened to in a very long time. Not only is a really great album, it is also a great soundtrack and a great listen. I have been waiting for a new recording by Lin Manuel Miranda, and this is his best. I was able to hear some of the different styles that he incorporates into his music. Some of the songs seem to be more suited to a jazz and funk album, but some are a bit more rock and soulful.  All in all it is a great album that deserves a lot of praise. I have heard many of his albums, but this is his best.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album  and I love Lin Manuel Miranda. He is a great artist. I think he is on the right path for his career. I have been in awe of his talent for a long time and now I am starting to understand why I started to listen to jazz and blues for the first time. This album is a mix of different styles and genres. He has a great voice and I can really relate to his music. I am always amazed at how this man has the ability to write and sing a song that could be sung only by him. This is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
