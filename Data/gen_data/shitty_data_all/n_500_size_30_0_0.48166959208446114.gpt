Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: This song is a tribute to the band that introduced me to jazz.  At first I was drawn to this album, and I remember thinking that I was in for a treat,  but that was before "The Jazz Singer" or "A Night at the Opera" came out.I've since listened to many of their albums, but "All Blues" is the one that stands out.And I'm not just talking about the music, but the lyrics, too. The opening line of the album is "In the old days we used to walk out in the night and listen to the blues".  And the blues, for me, comes in the form of the instrumentation that I enjoy the most,   drums and bass.   When I listen to this album, I'm really not just listening to the music.I can almost envision myself and the band playing on the streets of New Orleans in the 1930's.  I'm also a big fan of the Blues, so it's kind of fitting that I have this album in my collection.

Amazon review: This album is the closest I've come to a "Jukebox" for many years.  That is to say, I like one song and it is the one that I replay over and over again.  There is also an interesting story behind this particular album.  In the 60's and 70's, I was a member of a gospel band called the Goodmans.  They had several albums, most notably "Just a Little Love".  Although the song "Gone to Earth" was on that album, I was really proud of the song "My Soul".  I didn't think it would get any airplay, but it did.  Then, I was offered a part in a TV show called "The Crossroads".  I accepted and sang a number of songs for that show.  The show was a success, and we had a great time doing it.  I was asked to go out and record a gospel duet with one of the singers from that TV show.  I told producer Jimmy Braly, "I will do it but I will not record with someone who may not agree with me".  He said, "All right, just sing a duet with a guy who is more my style".  So I did.  "My Soul" went great, and then I had a second request from the show to sing a duet with a singer who was a little more conservative.  I said that I would, and in exchange I was asked to record "Ain't No Way".  I have always had a love for the blues, and so I agreed.  The song "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" was written by a lady named Dorothy Moore, who was a member of the band the Staple Singers.  This woman had a beautiful soprano voice, and she had a great voice.  I am happy to say that this is not a duet, but I am happy that this song got some airplay.  I believe that this is one of the best gospel songs ever written.  This song is a tribute to a lady named Dorothy Moore, who was a member of the Staple Singers.  She was one of the great Gospel singers of all time.  When I was asked to record this song, I was not only happy to do it, but I was also happy that it got some airplay.

Amazon review: This album has a lot to offer. I have listened to so many gospel albums over the past few years (to the point where I have literally lost count) that I have been thinking about putting together a little Gospel CD.  I have listened to this album over and over again, and I have to say that I like a lot of the songs on here.  I like the album cover, and I like the song "I Love You".  I also like the album, and I can see why this album was put out.  It has a lot of positive things to offer.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I bought this CD in the hope that there would be some Tom Waits in the CD.  I was not disappointed.I bought this CD to listen to at a friend's house.  What I like about Tom Waits is that he is very versatile.  I listen to him a few times a year and when I see him live, I will attend.  I love the songs that he has written-they are all beautiful and moving, even the ones that are not in this CD.  They are all very personal to him-he seems to have written only for himself.  I would like to hear more of his songs in the future.  A CD with songs from his other albums would be a great gift for a Tom Waits fan.  I found that I liked the CD-it is very well produced.I am not a Tom Waits fan per se-I am a musician, not a Tom Waits fan.  However I do like his music and enjoy listening to it.  What I like about this CD, is the sound quality-it sounds great.  There is no distortion or noise which is very good.  I highly recommend this CD-I have been listening to it everyday for about a month now, and love it and I will continue to listen to it.  I like the fact that Tom Waits has written quite a few songs for himself, and has been doing it for a long time, and is still able to write.  This CD has a great and personal sound without being watered down or made into some sort of gimmick.  I have listened for about a month and am very happy with this CD-it is one of the best I have heard in a long time.  I would consider it a must have in any Tom Waits fan's CD collection.

Amazon review: I bought this CD in hope that Tom Waits would appear in it.  It turned out to be a waste of time; however, I was very surprised and impressed.  First of all, there is no Tom Waits.  They played two songs, but they also played a song that Tom Waits wrote, "Don't Tell Me".  There were two other songs that Tom had written, "I Don't Think So" and "Suck My Kiss" which were left out of the CD.  The CD also contained an uncredited song written and sung by a female singer, "I Want It All".  It was a great surprise to find it on the CD.  All original songs, fantastic swinging band, and takes you back to a very glamourous era, but still very today.  Love it!  I had the song" Happiest Day Of My Life" For My Nieces Wedding And People Loved It!

John Lennon, of course, was great. The only thing I don't like is that the album was made before Apple Records. It would have been better if it was a compilation album. I didn't like "Back In The USSR" because it's a "one shot" song. If they had made more albums like this, the music industry would have continued.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: So glad to see that someone finally went through every one of his albums.  This is a pretty solid record.  The highlights are the songs from his solo acoustic albums, the tunes he released with his band, and the studio renditions of the classics.  I don't know if it's his best album, but it's certainly one of his better ones.  That said, the songs from his solo albums are a little disappointing.  His playing is still very good, but the songs are somewhat lacking.  There are some nice tunes on this album, but they just don't stand out as much as other tunes.

Amazon review: I don't generally listen to country music.  However, this artist does not disappoint.  He can play a mean guitar solo, and he's a good singer.

I like the movie version of this song better.  I haven't listened to the original for a while because I don't listen to music when I drive.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Most songs were lousy; she sings better by herself.

Amazon review: This is a good album though I wished it was longer.  The songs are about God and how He loves people.  They are simple but they are very meaningful.  This album is a keeper.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Great album, great songs.  One of my favorite songs is "God's Love" which has a great message about how God loves us and that He is always with us.  Other favorites include "Holy" and "Behold".  I am not sure why the title is "Inspirational".  It is simply a great album.  If you like Christian music this is the album for you.  There is some good music here but it is not a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am amazed that this is still a huge seller.  I wish it was longer, but this is a great album.  It's nice to have a CD that has contemporary songs.  There is a lot of gospel music on this CD, but it is not too much.  I like the songs and the lyrics, but the songs are somewhat predictable.  The CD does have some great songs though.  My favorite is "Heaven is My Home", "Heaven Is my Home" is my favorite song on the album.  I like the song "God's Love, God's Love" because it is a message of hope.  I wish I could listen to this album for hours.

Amazon review: This is a good album, as far as I can see.  It has the standard songs, but it also has some songs that I think are very good.  I like "I'm Going Home" and "God's Love" the best.

Amazon review: The album was very good.  I really like the songs on this album.  They are all different, but it is always good to have an album like this.  I also like the songs "My God Is Real" and "He's Got It".  I think they are very good.  They stand out because the others could not.  I like the songs "I'm Going Home", "I've Got You", "He's Got It", "My God Is Real", and "The Reason".  I am glad that this CD has a message about God and that He is real.  It also has a message about the love of God.  I like the message about the love of God.  It is very good.  I hope you do too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best Christian album I have ever heard.  The song "I'm Going Home" is the best song on the whole CD.  The album is a perfect soundtrack to life, and it should have a soundtrack to life.  It is a great album.  This is a very good CD.  It has great songs and it has a message.  I love it.  I am glad I bought this album.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: this album was so amazing! It's so great, and it's so good that all the songs are like songs. I was in tears at the end of the album, and I couldn't stop listening, I just kept listening until a couple of hours after I put it in the CD player (it's only 10 songs) and I still can't stop listening. If you need a good, peaceful, and peaceful album, this is the one.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of O'Hearn at all, but I like this album. I usually don't like to complain about a bad album, but I'm going to do it because this album is not a bad album, it's just not very good. It has some good songs in it, but not a great song per se.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

###
Amazon review: Lyrics are great, but the vocals aren't.  The vocals are good, but the lyrics just don't stand out.  They're not bad, but the lyrics don't match the melody or flow of the song.  Also, there are too many words.  There are over 100 words in the song.  It's like he wrote every word on the page and then cut and pasted it into the lyrics.  It's not a bad song, but it could have been written better.  And I don't think it was.  I think he just didn't know how to write songs.  He's a great lyricist, but he's got to get some of those great words, and some of those great melodies.  It's just that he doesn't have the songs.

Amazon review: This is a good song, but not a great song.  I can't believe that the singer can sing the song.  I've heard him sing it twice, and I can't believe he can sing it.  It's just one of those songs that you sing and people think you're a good singer.  But you can't sing it.  And you can't even sing it well.  The only thing you can do with it is that you can sing it to yourself or sing it to your friends.  The only good thing about this song is that the guitar sounds good.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: The song selection is decent.  I like most of the songs.  The production is good.  The production is not good.  The music is terrible.  The song selection is very poor.  All of the songs are about sex in a very low voice.  They are very annoying when you are trying to sleep or trying to relax.  I don't know if they think that is a sex song or just a rock song.  They sound like the first few seconds of a porno movie.  I'm not sure why they even put this cd out.  I feel like they are trying to get some money by selling these horrible songs.  This is the second CD that I have listened to because they sent this out.  I will not buy it again.  I hope they do NOT put any more out.  I will probably be buying a dvd.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of any Prince.  However, I am not disappointed with any album he has released, and this is certainly one of them.  The songs are all good, there are many good tracks including songs such as "Raspberry Beret", "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World", "If I Was Your Girlfriend", "When Doves Cry", "U Got It Bad", "1999", "Jerk It", "A Little Help From My Friends", "Little Red Corvette", "Kiss of Life" and "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World".
However, there is no song that has more of an impact on me than "Kiss of Life".  I have a feeling that Prince would never write a song titled "Kiss of Life".  He is a man who doesn't really enjoy the spotlight.  He is more likely to say something like "I've been writing music for the past 25 years and I have never written a song called Kiss of Life".
However, his last release was "1999" and this album is one of the best and most well produced albums that Prince has released.  I do not think this is the last Prince album that he will release, but it is an excellent release.  I do hope that he releases another album.
I am also not a fan of the music video.  I have never seen a music video until now and I have not understood the purpose or need for them.
However, the music video for "1999" is quite good and I have seen it several times.
The sound of the music is also quite good.  The album is not too expensive, but I do not think the music is that good.  The sound of the album is mixed and the sound of the sound is good.  The sound of the CD is mixed and the sound is good.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

This is actually a good song. The rhythm for the music is good and the beat is not quite out of tune, but it has a good groove to it. The lyrics are not that great, but the music that comes with it is excellent. I would have preferred a little more soul in the song, but that is okay.

Trouble with this song is that the beat is not quite in tune. You don't have to be that perfectionist to listen to this song. If the beat is off then the song will sound out of key. I don't know if the other reviewers would agree with that though.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: The last song "He Said He Wasn't" was a very good song, but I couldn't help but be disturbed by it. When I was listening to the song at work someone interrupted it to say that they thought the lyrics were very sexist. I was appalled by this and I was so hurt by it, I could not listen to the song anymore. I cannot believe for a second that someone thought it was okay to say that. I'm glad this is only a sample of the negative reviews that Amazon have received. I was so disappointed when I found out that the song had been pulled from the website. I'm hoping they will change their minds.

I am currently listening to the last song on this CD called "I Don't Need You", and it just melts me to tears.  I can't believe this CD won a Grammy.  I am waiting to hear the other songs.

Amazon review: This song never made it on the radio until a few years ago.  Not even then for a year or two.  I think the people with the volume turned up full blast and it just faded away.

Amazon review: This song is so powerful.  I have it on my iPod.  It's the one song that I've listened to for the most amount of time and had the most impact on me in my life.  I love it.  I love it so much that one day I had to go to the grocery store and the man was singing it the whole time he was in the store.  I thought I had heard it before.  My husband was singing it in the car and I told him it was time to stop.  I have never heard a thing like that ever in my life.  I was blown away.  It's the one song that I can listen to for hours and not get tired of it.

Amazon review: It's a beautiful melody.  The song is full of emotion, but there is no "back story."  I don't know how anyone could even listen to this song and not be moved by it.  It was a gift from God and I'm very grateful that God gave me this gift.

Amazon review: I love this song and have to admit that I'm not a fan of country music.  I love a lot of songs, but I don't like country music.  But when I heard this song on the radio last night, I put the volume at full blast and sat there in awe.  If you haven't heard this song or have never heard it, then this is for you.  You just might be surprised.  I love the song, I love the words, but I have to admit something.  When you hear this song, you better have your eyes shut.  It makes you cry, but you are scared to hear the words.  It's an amazing song about two people who are supposed to have it all but one of them is missing the most important person in his life.  I don't know if I have ever told you this, but I have always felt like I've been in love with my wife.  I can't explain it.  It's how it is.  She is my whole world to me.  My entire life revolves around her.  But the one person that I am missing the most in my life is you.  I'm supposed to have everything, but you are the one man that I can't live without.  I can't even explain it.  You are my everything.

Amazon review: This song makes me listen to my wife when I'm not with her.  I know she loves it, but I can't hear it on the radio without hearing it live.  I love this song, and I love my wife.

Amazon review: This CD only plays for a few seconds and then it pauses and starts over - each time it does the same thing.  I should have ordered the new CD I will never buy a used one again.

Amazon review: I have had problems with this CD over the past two months.  I ordered both of the Brandy CD's and the new "Wanya" CD.  They start immediately and play for about 10 minutes.  Then they stop.  The first one played for over 5 hours - I was so frustrated that I ordered the second one - 5 minutes later the same thing happened.  I have tried both of the songs twice - they played for half an hour each time.  I have tried them on a 2 gig external hard drive and a 5 gig internal drive.  I have tried them on a usb flash drive - same thing.  I have had the flash drives hooked up to external hard drives in the past and it would play for several hours each time.  I then tried them on a usb flash drive hooked up to the internal hard drive.  The same thing happened.  I have tried them on a different computer.  It's the same thing.  The only difference between the computers is that one has Win XP - the other has Windows Vista.  I live in a very small town - I cannot afford to have them sent to me from overseas.  I was so frustrated - I had to call tech support - and they told me they had to order the new CD from overseas and ship it to me in 3 days.  I asked the tech support person to tell me how much that would cost.  She said $14.00 plus shipping and handling.  I could not afford that.  I did not like the way they treated me.  I have had problems in the past with them over the past two months.  I like the songs on this CD - it is a good CD - but it does not play for more than a few seconds and then it pauses and starts over.  I should have ordered the new CD I will never buy a new one again.

Amazon review: Brandy's voice sounds a lot different than she did when she was on the stage and singing with the Grateful Dead.  She sounds too smooth and sounds like she is singing at a club with a band.  This is a great song, but I do not like the way it is sung - I do not like the way she sings - I do not like the music she plays.  If she would sing the same way in a live concert with the Grateful Dead - I would be thrilled.  I am not thrilled with the way the music plays on my computer.  I do not like the way it plays on my portable hard drive - I do not like the way it plays on my external hard drive - I do not like the way it plays on my USB flash drive - I do not like the way it plays on my internal hard drive - I do not like the way it plays on an external hard drive I have not heard the song on a different computer - I have not heard it on a computer that has Win XP - I have not heard it on a computer that has Windows Vista.  I do not like the way it plays on a different computer with Win XP - I do not like the way it plays on a different computer with Windows Vista.  I do not like the way it plays on my portable hard

Amazon review: I have had the same problem with this CD - it plays a short period of time when I turn it on and then pauses and starts over.  I think this is very strange.  The only time I have had this problem is when it plays on my portable hard drive.  I could not figure out how to fix the problem, so I ordered the new CD and I am sure that I will not have to order the new CD.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Fascination with the past, the present and the future

by JAMES ALTMAN

With the holiday season just around the corner and with all the festivities come the days filled with a lot of "I did that" and "When I get back from vacation I'm going to do that" and "Who would have thought that I would be so close to finding my soul mate".

I say to you today that a man who is not content with the simple life of a simpleton, will go to the ends of the earth to find the contentment of a real man.

I know that the future can be a scary thing for many of us. How do you know what the future holds for you? How do you know what the future will bring? Well, the only way to find the contentment of a real man, is to go where the future has not yet been, and to go where the future has yet to be. This is where the true content of man lies.

In recent years, the United States has been blessed with many great artists. Many of the great artists

Amazon review:  "Kiss" is one of the songs that I like the most. It's a really fun danceable song, and if it happens to get on the radio, I will be sure to play it. The only thing that I don't like is the lyrics, because they were written in a way that is not too positive, but in a way that makes it seem positive. I wouldn't know about this music if it weren't for this song. I don't know what the song is trying to say, but it's just not good. I would rather listen to something that is bad than listen to something that is good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I like 'Kiss' more than anything else but it has a very bad melody. I think it would be better sung by a male or female singer. The song starts with an out-of-key guitar riff which is annoying. I don't know what it is trying to say, but it's just not good. I would give it a poor rating, but I'm not sure how to rate it.
