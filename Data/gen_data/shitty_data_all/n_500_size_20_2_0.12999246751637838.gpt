Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I downloaded this as a way to not have to take time out of my busy schedule to listen to this song, and I am very glad I did.  Its a great song, but it sounds like something you'd hear in a band from the 70's or 80's.  There's no way this is going to get played on the radio, its too old sounding.

Amazon review:  Jackie's voice is so warm and inviting, I find myself humming the opening lines all the time.  It makes me feel very cozy on the couch.  It is one of those CDs where I find myself listening to it over and over again.  It's sort of like when you're in a room full of people and they all start singing in harmony.  You start humming along as well.  Well, I didn't listen to this CD through it's entire length, but when I did it was the most enjoyable I've ever heard.

Amazon review: Jackie always delivers the goods, but this particular one just isn't good.  I'm not a fan of her sound, and I'm not going to waste any time and money on this CD.  I'm just going to put it on a shelf and forget about it.

Amazon review:  Jackie has got this song down, but I'm not going to listen to it.  There are a lot of people out there who think that this song is awesome, but I'm not going to waste my time on it either.  All I need for this song to be an instant classic is for someone to sing it in a movie.  That would make it a real classic.  I'm sure it would sell a lot of CDs.

This is a great song to put on in the shower. I've gotten so immersed in the song that I can't hear anything else. It's the most relaxing song I've ever heard in my life.

This song is great. I have listened to it many times and I really like it. I would really like to listen to it in the car, but I think it would be hard to sing. I hope it comes out as a CD.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I really enjoy country music, but the vocals of the female artists are always too high and they sound like they're not from the southern states. I was looking for a country song that was a little more "easy" to listen to and thought I would give this a try. It was a good start to a new playlist and I liked the lyrics even though they weren't very "classic" country.

Amazon review: This album is just a compilation of very generic songs from various artists. Even though the cover says it's a "compilation album" it's not really a compilation at all. Some of the songs are very repetitive and some of the songs sound very similar. The songs are a little annoying to listen to, but I guess that's what makes it so good.

It is a great record, and I think that if you are a fan of the folk music of Ireland, this is your album. It is well worth the price and is the closest you could get to the best of Irish folk music. It would be hard to find a better album of Irish folk music. I am excited for you all to hear it. I encourage you to buy this album. It is a great album."

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Well, here is the solution, I am an audio snob, so, I'll try to help you a little bit.
I think it is a very good decision to use the MP3 format to store the songs. It is cheap, and it is ok when you use it to store your music, but I think it is better to use the CD format (not only if you want to store the songs, but for the songs you want to purchase).
There are many reasons to use the CD format, the first one is that it is a digital format, so that the music can be transferred to another computer, to another memory and other devices. This way it is a lot better to protect your music from any damage.
The second reason is that the CD format is the better quality of the two, and the third reason is that, it is much easier (if you have your own CD label software) to make a CD out of the MP3 files. That is my opinion, I don't know if you are an expert in CD or not, but, I think you should take them in the CD format.
I think the best solution for you, is to buy the cd of the songs you want, and then burn the CD in CD-R, and then sell the CD-R to other people. That's the only solution that I can think of, but maybe you can find a better one.
Good luck, and have fun!

A:

I have always used the CD format, and I'm not an audio snob.  I also have never purchased a new cd before, and it doesn't make sense to have to spend $40, unless you have an extra $40 laying around.
In general, a CD is a more durable storage medium than an mp3 file.  It is also much easier to rip CDs for other people, or even use as a backup medium for your own mp3 library.  You can play mp3 files on your computer, but the CD is designed for more portable playback.

 

However, the CD is not a perfect solution.  There is a small amount of file corruption due to the format.  If you are a paranoid person who likes to be sure their music is 100% perfect, then you might want to consider buying a new CD, and rip the songs to your computer.  Or, you might want to pay for a copy of a CD with a watermark on it, to protect against a CD drive failure.  Then, when you rip it for other people to use, you can remove the watermark, and you don't have to worry about someone ripping the music for you and destroying your whole collection.
Another option is to pay someone to rip the songs to CD for you.  You can take it to be ripped, and they will play it on a CD player, and they will also cut and mix the tracks.  Then, they will burn the product to CD, and if you want, then you can take it to your friends and relatives, and they can rip the songs and listen to them.  Then, when you're ready to sell, you can take the CD to your music company and they can burn it to CD for you.
Finally, you could even buy a few blank CDs, and then make a custom CD cover.  Just use a photo of the cover of one of your CDs, and then write in the names of the songs on the album, and whatever else you want.  Then, you can sell your custom CD to your music company, and they can burn it to CD for you.

 

 

A:

I have always used the CD format, but I will buy a CD, if I am forced to. The thing is, I will not buy a new CD unless it has an embedded watermark.  I have never had a CD that didn't have one.
I think that mp3 files are a very good format for music, not only because it is cheap and easy to copy but also because MP3 files are compressed. I personally prefer to buy the songs from the internet and not from my local library, so I would rather buy them from an mp3 file, and then I would rip them to a CD.

Amazon review: I received my CD today and it was a CD that was new and did not look like it had been opened and resealed. After listening to the CD, I am very disappointed in the quality of the CD itself. The sound quality is pretty poor and the songs are not very long or well written. The songs are very short and have little variety. The music is repetitive and the songs are not very musical. The lyrics are written in a very childish manner, the songs are sung in a child like manner, and the song titles make no sense. This is the type of CD that you would buy for your children or someone that has children that they want to hear music that is not too noisy. The songs are very repetative and lack emotion.

I just started listening to some of these old tunes on my way home from work. I really like the old songs and would like to listen to more.

There are a few good ones. I like "Waltz for Debby" and "Sally" the best.

I also like "Babes in Toyland" and "The Very Best of."

The other songs I like are "Oh, Lonesome Me" and "That's All."

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: The only reason why I bought this, was because I heard on the radio, that there was a new Pink Floyd CD coming out. I'm a fan, and wanted to hear it. I'm glad I did, because this is a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Not all of it. I'm a long time fan of Pink Floyd. I thought this was a good album, but I was disappointed by the ending of the album. It didn't hit me in the heart. In the end, I bought this because of the new album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is good for what it is. It's a classic album. The songs are all very good, and the production is good. The only thing is, that the ending is a little disappointing. A song that didn't quite come across to me. That said, the album is good for what it is.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Well, this, is a good album. It is a good album, that doesn't sound like a Pink Floyd album. I guess I was expecting more. It actually is a good album, but it has some bad songs, that I didn't like.

Amazon review: I love Pink Floyd but this is the first time I've ever heard that they were going to release a Pink Floyd album. I've listened to them all and I like them all except this one. It sounds like a Beatles album rather than a Pink Floyd album. No big deal. I am happy with the rest of the album though.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The only reason why I bought this, is because I was looking for a Pink Floyd album. I was looking for a Pink Floyd album for two years, but I couldn't find one. This is a great album, but I don't think it's Pink Floyd. It's a great album, but it's not Pink Floyd.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my entire life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after seeing Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player, Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I figured it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop synth stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good song, but it really has nothing to do with the album. I think that the song should be separated.

###
Amazon review: I was really disappointed when I heard this album because I thought to myself that this band was better then the last one. The song "Livin' in the Past" is one I have never listened to. I have heard it before on the radio but I thought that it was just a cover song. For some reason, I thought its not good. I think that the band is still developing in their music. They need to come up with a new sound that is not just like the last one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this and "What I Said" from the "Last Breath" album. And the song "Livin' in the Past" is pretty good. "The Best is Yet to Come" and "I don't Care" are good songs too. And "You're Not Alone" is pretty good. The song "Love Song" is nice but the lyrics are wrong.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the music from this band, and I really like the band. I think that they are on of the best bands of the era of hip hop/rap.

The drums sound like a bunch of garbage that was thrown in the trash can after the garbage man left.  The bass in the background is a bit annoying.  Overall, this song makes me not want to listen to anything else from this band.  Not that I hate music, but that song is so bad that I would rather listen to a band that rocks my socks off then this one.  No wonder I never got into the band.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This is a bad song. The song has a really bad beat. The whole song is a bad mess. The song is not good at all. I don't know why this is the only song on this CD.

Amazon review: The song is good. The only thing it doesn't have is a cool title. The song is really good, though. I like it but it's not a great song. It is only worth 1 star, but it's a better song than the rest of the songs on the CD. I'm not a fan of the song, but I like all the songs on this CD. I think it's a good CD, and I'll be buying it again and again.

Amazon review: The song has a really bad beat. The whole song is a bad messy mess. The song is not good at all. I don't know what the hell is happening with this song. I don't know why I have to listen to this song over and over again. I wish it would just disappear. I don't know what the heck is going on with this song. I'm sorry, but I don't think this song has ever been a good song.

Amazon review: I liked the song "I Know There's A Great Big Secret." It was very catchy and very danceable, and had some nice riffs. The song was pretty much what I expected. It didn't really get my attention until the last five minutes of the song when it slowed down into the chorus. I can't believe I didn't notice this until the last minute.

Amazon review: I really like the song "You've Got The World On A String." It's an upbeat dance single that I really like. The song is really well produced and it's a fun song.

Amazon review: This is a movie soundtrack album. I've never listened to a soundtrack album before, and I don't usually like them. I was a little hesitant to buy this one because it was my first soundtrack album. But it's really good. The songs are really good and the songs are all good. I like the songs.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
