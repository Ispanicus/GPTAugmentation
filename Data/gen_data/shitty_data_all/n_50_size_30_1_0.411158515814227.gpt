It's a shame to see this album go out the way it did.

I've listened to this album in total about 7 times and each time I come back to it and listen to it I just can't get over how great it is and how it holds up with each listen.

This album is all about Eminem's feelings. The song I am listening to today is one of the songs that

Amazon review: On September 9, 2008, Amazon.com was offering a “30%
Off” coupon on The Beatles: Rock Band for the limited time offer.
I placed the coupon code at checkout, and
the sale ended on September 21, 2008. That
is when I noticed that the sale was ending and
there were no more coupons available. So I
called customer service, and they were not
able to find a way to get the coupon code
back, and told me I would have to buy the
game from Amazon.com at full price. This
was a big mistake because I lost over $300.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that are really good.  I really liked the songs "The Long Black Vial" and "The Time Is Now".  The songs are in the style of the early R&B group The Verve was in the 80's.

Amazon review: This is a nice album.  It has a lot of great songs.  I like "The Long Black Vial", "What Is This Thing Called Love", the slow "Pretend This Never Happened" and the songs the whole "The Real Deal".  I would like to see this album on a cd but I think it would be too long.

Amazon review: I did not like it, to be honest.  It does not sound like the Black Keys at all.  It sounds like a group from New Orleans.  They do not write good songs.  They do not write good songs.

Amazon review: The first time I listened to this album, I thought I  was going to throw up.  I listened it again recently and I am sure this album is worth any amount of money you'll spend on it.

The first album I ever heard of was the band "Passion Pit" by the name of "The Faint". I had never heard a band with so much energy and passion, that were as talented as their live shows.

This is the second album by "The Faint", after the "The Faint" album. The music is a reflection of the same feeling and emotions that are felt by the band, and yet I can hear a different feeling, and that is because I am in a different state of mind and emotion.

Overall, I would say the music is good, but the lyrics and vocals are not as strong as the music. The lyrics are all positive, and I think that is what makes it an album that you would listen to.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I'm a huge opera lover and this is the most wonderful and moving musical that I've ever heard. Although I like most of the songs on the album I was hoping that the title song would be in the opera, as it sounds so much like a song that I hear in my head when I'm in a good mood. But this being an opera, I was very disappointed when I listened to this album. I know that the lyrics are incredible and the music is magical but I was expecting something more than this.

Amazon review: The first thing to say before I begin is that I have never been a professional musician. I know that I don't have the proper skills. I am also not a professional opera singer. However, I am a professional music lover, and I have loved this opera for many years. So, I am going to go ahead and give my opinion on this album. The first thing that I did was to listen to the album cover. The album cover was good and gave me the impression that this album will be a great opera. The first song is called “The Rose” and it is beautifully sung. The next song is called “I Believe” and the first phrase is sung by the soprano, Lisa D'Amico. The next phrase is sung by the tenor, Michael White. The next phrase is sung by the tenor, Nicholas Slon. The last phrase is sung by the other tenor, David Spitz. The first phrase is sung by the flute, and the final phrase is sung by the flute, and the last phrase is sung by the violin. The third and fourth phrases are sung by the oboe, and the last phrase is sung by the oboe, and the first phrase is sung by the harp. I listened to the album cover more carefully and noticed how the soprano was dressed in her typical evening wear and how she was wearing her hair up. I noticed how Lisa D'Amico had her hair up and how there was a strand of her hair in front of her ear. I noticed how Michael White was dressed in his typical evening wear and how he was wearing his hair down. I noted that Nicholas Slon was wearing his typical evening wear and how he was wearing his hair up. I noted that David Spitz was wearing his typical evening wear and how he was wearing his hair down.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review:  This is a very good album. If you like jazz, this is your album. If you like jazz you will love it.   I found this compilation to be a very good representation of the jazz scene in the late 1960's.  The first ten minutes or so were good. The second half was good. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the first half.

Amazon review: I have to admit... I like this CD a lot.  I have only listened to the first six songs.  The first five songs are pretty good.   This album is a good representation of the 1960's jazz scene.   The first six songs are very good.   The seventh song, "The Bitter End" is a little less good.   The eighth song, "I Don't Want To Know" is a little better. The ninth song, "The End" is a little better.   The tenth song, "The End" is a little better.   The eleventh song, "The Bitter End" is a little better.   The twelfth song, "The Bitter End" is a little better.  The thirteenth song, "I Don't Want To Know" is a little better, but not that much.   The fourteenth song, "The Bitter End" is a little better, but not that much.   The fifteenth song, "I Don't Want To Know" is a little less good, but it still is a good song.   The sixteenth song, "The Bitter End" is a little better, and the seventeenth song, "I Don't Want To Know" is a little better than the previous song, "The Bitter End."   The eighteenth song, "The Bitter End" is a little better.  I like this album.   I don't think it is bad.   I would recommend this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This song is a very "soft" song that is really very sweet. The lyrics are very deep, but still short and sweet. This is a song that I would definitely give to my girlfriend.

This song is about how to love each other and how to be loved by each other.
