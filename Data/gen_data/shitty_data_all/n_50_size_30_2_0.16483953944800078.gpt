Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Wow, I really don't know where to begin. This is the best music I have owned since the days of NWA as far as I'm concerned. I was at a wedding, and the band was playing. I was so bored that I had to come listen to the music. It was so good, I just knew I had to buy it. A friend of mine bought it for me, and I listened to it over and over. I have no idea how the music got to her. She just called me and asked if I wanted it so she could give it to me. After listening to it I was amazed. There was no way I was going to pay $19 for this. After the band played, I called my friend and asked her what she was doing with it. She said she gave it to me. I was amazed, and so were you. I thought I was going to die when I heard it. It was that good. I would buy it again, but I wouldn't pay $19.00. It was worth it. I really don't have any other words except how it really brought me to tears. I will never be the same again.

It's so sad it is on here, but I can't just stop listening to this song. I can't believe it is a single. I can't believe it was a hit and has been in the top 20 and 30. I can't believe I listened to this song for over an hour! I love this song so much! I am going to buy every song on here. I am going to purchase some more of your albums. I love you guys so much, and I will keep singing this song till I can't sing it anymore.

Amazon review: I was extremely excited to listen to this song when it was first released. It is one of my favorite songs, so I was excited to hear it at least a couple times until it was released as a single. It has a great beat and is very upbeat. I was shocked to find out that it was a hit. I was so happy that it was a hit! If you love this song, I highly recommend that you buy it. I am a huge fan of this song, so I am also selling it on ebay. This song is one of my favorite songs, so if you feel it is as good as I do, I would recommend you buy it as well.

Amazon review: I love the song, so I was extremely excited when I was searching for it online. The first time I heard the song, I was so impressed. I felt like I was standing on top of the world. I had to have it. I couldn't believe that it was only available as a single single in the US. I didn't even know it was out there. I purchased the song and listened to it constantly for a couple weeks. When it was released as a single, I was so excited. I couldn't believe that it was a hit. I was so excited I couldn't sleep a night for two weeks. I was so excited I had to listen to the song constantly. I love this song. I am still waiting for the official release of the full album, so I can go buy it.

I love the way the song carries through, so it can get stuck in your head and you can't get it out. I think it is the most emotional song I have ever listened to. It is the best song I have ever heard. I believe that it is one of the best songs of all time.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I am not sure if this is an issue with the player or the player itself. Either way, I would like to know a possible solution.

A:

This is how you can get the player to play faster than normal, without using the "slower" button:

Go to the "Slower" option and select "Play at Normal Speed"

I don't know how to get the option to change the speed without clicking the "slower" button again, but that's the first way to get them to play the way you want.

 

 

A:

The speed slider is only affecting the playback speed, not the rewinding speed. You can select the playback speed (the middle slider) and set it to fast or normal. You can then set the rewinding speed to normal or slow. 
When you select a playback speed, it applies to both the playback speed and the rewinding speed, so you can select fast and slow.

If you want to set the speed to normal, and then when you want to rewind, you can use the option "Rewind when paused"

A:

There is an additional button (with a grey cross and black dot) on the page. Press it and it will change playback speed mode to "Normal Speed" and playback speed to 3x.

Then you can pause and rewind.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a great addition to any classical music collection.  The CD does not have all the songs of the original cast recordings, so this is not a full performance of the songs.  The CD is a good representation of the songs and is a good alternative to listening to the original cast recordings.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD a few years after the original performance.  I did listen to the CD twice because I wanted to know for sure if the original cast recording was actually the same as the recording on this CD.  The original cast recording is actually a few years older than this CD, and in the original recording the music on the CD was played by the original cast members, but in this recording they played the music by themselves.  The two recordings are not in close synchronization with each other, but I would have no problem believing the original cast recording was the same as the performance on this CD.  I do believe the second CD is a good representation of the songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I had a few CDs of the original cast recordings, and I wanted to hear them again.

I have been listening to this CD for several weeks, and I have already made several new friends.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

A very good collection of music. Very clear, very good sound. It is very well arranged. A lot of classical music is quite difficult to find and I feel sorry for people who have an ipod who are not able to listen to classical music. Most classical music has very little to do with the ipod and I hope this cd will help them.

I have only used this a limited amount of time but so far it has been excellent! I would purchase it again. The cd, though not as good as my other classical cd's, is still a very good cd. The only negative is that the booklet is so thin that I could see the cd from one end to the other.

This is a wonderful and enjoyable cd. I have enjoyed listening to it for a number of years and every time I get a new cd of classical music from my ipod it is always a pleasure to listen to. I have been

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Wow.  I have been very disappointed in this album. They were supposed to be the "new girl" for me, but I am still very disappointed.  I will give them that they are different from the other bands out there, but I am not feeling that they will be the next big thing.  I will be back to them as soon as I can.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not really a huge fan.  This is the first band I have come across in a long time that I actually like.  It's like they got their heads on straight and are on the right track.  I really wish they would come to a new town and play in a venue that would be a little more like the one we have at my house.  I like their music, but they have never been "a big deal" for me.  I'll stick to the greats.

Amazon review: First of all, I'm a sucker for a good country song.  Secondly, I really like the idea of this band,  but I'm not sure they are the right band for me.  I like their style and I think they are a lot more creative than the average country band.  I don't know if that's the right place for them, though.  I think there are some really great country bands out there.  But I'm not sure they're the right band for me.  I'm not really a country fan anyway.  I don't know who they are yet, but I hope they do get to a point in their career where they will be able to make a true country music album and I will be able to like them.  I think I'll wait and see.  I believe they will get there one day.

Amazon review: It's a shame that this is a band that is so popular and yet they never seem to release a good album.  But maybe I'll listen to them.  They are new and I don't know if they are going to be a big deal, but I'll keep my ear to the ground and see what they do.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my niece, but she doesn't have a lot of money.  The CD is great, but the production is terrible.  I think I'll pass on the CD.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

You can tell a lot of thought went into it, and most of it was written by Meghan.  I think the only two problems I find with it is that it's a little too long and it's a little too happy.

             I think I was bored so I listened to it. I'm not going 
            to BUY it!

A:

It's an old song and I don't know if it's still available on iTunes. It might be worth a try though.

I think I was bored so I listened to it. I am not going to BUY it!

A:

I've never heard of this song, but from what I've heard of it, it's like a generic pop-rock song with some generic lyrics. There's an original, slightly less generic version on their website, but that's probably not the version you're seeing in the iTunes store.

              We're so in love! 
             Just like the first time! 
            We go out to the moon and back! 
            And, we're so in love! 
        Just like the first time!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I'm waiting for the new album by Meghan Trainor and I'm really hoping they will have a new CD with new songs.  My wife says she wants to hear Meghan Trainor's new songs. But I can't listen to them anymore.  I love this artist. I have to listen to her new CD's.  I was really looking forward to hearing this album. I really like Meghan's voice. But the album just isn't for me. I feel like if the artist was better, then the songs would be better, but it just doesn't work out. Its just not for me.  I'm sorry I'm going to say this, but I really don't like this album.  I hope that you will buy the clean version of the album.

Amazon review: A great mix of hip hop and hip hop infused with a very unique sounding, unique voice to it.  When I first heard the song "The Boy Is Mine" by Daughtry it was a song that sounded like a modern version of an old school hip hop song.  They had it right.  I like to call it The Boy Is Mine.  It is one of the best songs that I have heard on the CD.  The lyrics are brilliant.  The vocals on the track have great clarity and it has a very unique sound.

###
Amazon review: Great song, but not so much for me.  It has some cool parts and the lyrics are nice, but the chorus and the "new" style of music are kind of annoying.  To me it sounds like the old school version of rap / singing.  I think that Daughtry sounds great, he just needs to have a little bit more of a new sound with the lyrics and vocals.  The track "What I Like About You" by Christina Perri was well done and the chorus was a very nice touch.

I am not sure what this group is trying to do, but this is just not a good song.   I will not buy this track.  I do not think that it is worth the money to me.   For me, I have listened to this song at least twice.  I like the music, so I guess if you have to listen to this song, you might as well.

Amazon review:  I received this CD early.  I read the reviews and thought that this CD was ok, but I was still excited to listen to the CD.

I will give the CD a 2, but only because I am a fan of the band and this is such a positive review.   I will not buy this CD unless I am forced to.  I will listen to the CD until I am out of money or until I get bored.  I will not buy the CD just because of this.   I am sure that there are some mistakes, but in the end, you just have to listen to the tracks to see who was right and who was wrong.  If someone has to listen to this CD, then they must like the album.  It is not that I do not like the tracks, I just do not like the production flaws and the lyrics.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

I love the cover of the CD.  It's a picture of the ocean, but it doesn't really describe what the music sounds like.  I don't know how to explain it.  I just don't think it's for me.

Amazon review: I'm not a huge Hip-Hop fan, but I was very curious to see what would come from this man who made the song "Pimpin'" so famous. I can assure you it is not the same album as "Romeo Must Die" or "N.O.R.E.D." and I can't imagine this man selling a million copies of his second album, "Pimpin" to this day.  The song "I'm a G.O.A.T." is one of the worst songs I've heard in a long time.

Amazon review: I think this has to be the worst hip-hop album of the year. If you had the chance to pick one out of the bunch, I would have picked the album.

Amazon review: This album is a dud.  There is no rhyme or reason to the lyrics on this album and it is just plain stupid.

Amazon review: I just recently got this album and I was very excited to hear the new album from Dallas Holm, one of my favorite rappers.  I have to say that this is not a stand out album by a rapper that I've heard in quite some time.  The album does have the most generic lyrics I've ever heard on a hip hop album.  It's almost like a rap album just with generic rhymes and not a single song that was worth a damn.  If you want a generic hip hop album that has some variety and a song that is well done, then this is not the album for you.  I give this album a 1-star rating because it is average at best.

I am a huge fan of Dallas Holm and have been for a while.  This album is not the best one he has put out, but at the moment it's the worst one he has put out. The tracks are generic and the lyrics are not only generic but very stupid.  The only thing that keeps this album from being one of the worst in Hip-Hop is the song "All I've Got".  The song does have some good tracks on it, but is there really a reason to put this album out?

It is clear to me that he is the voice of what a generation is all about. I am only sad he is now so irrelevant and so easily forgotten.

I felt that the song just sounded like the same old stuff, which is not what I expected from the album.  The last song just wasn't for me.  The song "I Wanna Borrow Your Face" is a song that is very mediocre at best.  The album is good overall, but I don't think it was worth the price of the album.

Amazon review: I am an old school hip hop fan who loves Eminem.  This is not a perfect album.  There are some very good songs, but there are also some not so good songs.  I listened to this album several times and I can't tell you what it is about.  I believe this is an average album.  The only good thing is the sample is just so annoying.  It just ruins the whole thing.  I thought there was some good songs on the album, but I just can't remember what they were.

Amazon review: I have always had a great interest in Eminem and have bought many of his albums, but this album is the one that stands out the most.  I listened to it several times and I really enjoyed it.  I don't know what it is about, but I thought it was one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album yet, but I am going to do so very soon.  I listened to it and it was really good, but I noticed that the sample was used in the song "I Wanna Borrow Your Face" which I thought was just weird.  I thought it was a good album, but I just thought it needed a little more imagination, and not using a sample.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: It's good. I really liked it. The vocals really made it. I did have a few problems with the CD, mainly because the album was shipped via a company that does not have a CD store.

It is not really a musical or dance CD. It was recorded at Sony's studio in Hollywood, California. They did not do a great job as far as the studio acoustics go. The sound is very dark and the microphones are very low. The music is kind of hard to hear. But, the sound is very good. This is a good collection of ballads, love songs, and secular songs performed by Jewel.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: For those of you who had the chance to see the play, a musical that was so well done in my opinion, I do recommend seeing the play. I do not understand why the people who see the play do not see the film version. It is an amazing musical with a great cast and a great plot. I am not saying the movie is bad I am just saying it is not the same. I would suggest that you see the play. I was disappointed with the movie. It was not the same and I am sure it will be in the theater soon. I will keep my ticket to the play, thank you.

Amazon review: The CD is a collection of songs written by Charles Lloyd,  Paul McCartney,  and Bernie Taupin.  The album is more of an anthology of musical styles than a single cohesive album.  However,  the songs do have some common points as to the types of melodies,  rhythms and instrumentation used.  The album is a beautiful,  relaxing and enjoyable listen.  Some songs are a bit less enjoyable,  for example, the chorus to The Ocean in the Garden and the beginning of The Last Time.  However, overall,  the CD is a beautiful and enjoyable addition to any collection.
