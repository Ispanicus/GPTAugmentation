Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This download was added to my playlist to try to listen to it, but I found it to be very boring.  I had to go back to the song list to find a new song to listen to.  I couldn't stand the repeated background music.  I also found the lyrics extremely boring.  I'm sure it was the repetitive nature of the album, but after listening several times to this CD I found it to be very boring.

Amazon review: A song by the band who wrote "I'm Gonna Be" and "Baby's Got a Brand New Bag" by the same name.  Both of these songs were popular with the '60s pop music generation.  It was the second single from their debut album "Boomerang" which was released in December 1959.

Amazon review: I have had the song "Passion" on my "to listen" to list since the early 2000s, but recently I have been unable to locate the correct lyrics.  I have tried searching for it, but have yet to find the correct lyrics.  The reason I have not been able to find them is, I have been unable to find where the lyrics have been placed on the CD.  If I could locate the correct lyrics, there would be hope for me to listen to the song.  I believe the lyrics are on the CD under the track "Passion".

Amazon review: I bought this CD on a whim and I'm glad I did. I really like it. The songs are not perfect, but they have a nice feel to them. This is a good CD if you like guitar music, and they are definately one of my favorites. It is a little difficult to hear the vocals on the CD, but other than that it is not a problem. This is a good CD!

Amazon review: I bought this CD on a whim and it was a good purchase. The songs were good and the music on this CD was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that they used a lot of guitars as opposed to the other CD's I have purchased. The songs are all good and are worth the $10. If you like good song lyrics and not so much in the sound that the guitar is playing, you will definately like this CD. This is a good CD.

Amazon review: I bought this album because the song "Forget Me Not" sounded good. The album is a good CD and one of the better albums I have purchased. The songs are all good though and are worth the price of the CD. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes blues, rock, folk and country. I would also recommend this CD to anyone who likes good music. The album is a great purchase.

Amazon review: I bought and have been playing this CD since I received it. I have found a few songs that I have never heard before on the radio or on the CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I would have given it a 4 star but I have to say that I thought it was a 3.  I'll give it a 4 star, though, because it was very entertaining and there were some really decent moments. The whole "twist" was a little silly but when he does sing he sounds pretty good.

Amazon review: A lot of people don't realize that there are actually two versions of "The Boy Is Mine".  The first one is the one they put on the album, while the one they did in concert is completely different.  The CD version is a little better than the live version, because the performance he gave in concert was a little more "authentic" but not enough to make the CD version superior to the concert version.  I would say that the CD version is better than the live version if you're a fan of the original version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: One of the best songs I have ever heard.  I have a lot of respect for the artist and everything but this song just speaks to me, and it's also very emotional because it is about love and the love of a special person.  The song is about the pain that a person gets when someone they love dies and the person gets over it.  The song is about how hard it is to be heartbroken and the pain that comes from it.  The song is just really beautiful, and I can't imagine anyone not being moved by this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this is a great song or not.  It does sound a little like "I Feel Good" but it doesn't really sound like "I Feel Good".  There are some great chords in the bridge but most of it is the same old, same old.

It's a song about the power of a man's love and how it can overcome anything.  It's a great song.  You can really tell that they were a little disappointed with this song.  It doesn't really have a strong chorus and it's hard for me to feel that it's "one of the best on the album" because they have a couple that are better but it still isn't as strong as this song.  
In my opinion, it is a great song.  I give it an 8.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I don't really like this album,  I think the CD is an hour long and I only got to about the 30 minute mark.  I listened to it many times and I just did not enjoy it and had to get rid of it.  I thought to myself why did I listen to it so many times?    I love The Beatles and I love Led Zeppelin and I love The Beatles and I love Led Zeppelin,  but I just don't love this CD.

I wish I could say I enjoyed the songs,  but that's not the case.  These songs just don't appeal to me.    How can a Christian girl enjoy songs like "How Great Thou Art" and "It Is Well With My Soul" and "It Is Well With My Soul."    I also liked the song "You'll Never Walk Alone" and "Praise the Lord and Pray to the Lord."    I love to sing and sing praise,  and I just don't know why I'm so against this CD.  It's so good.  I just don't really like it.  I haven't listened to the songs since I bought it.  I'm not sure if I would have bought it if it was a Christian artist like myself.    I'm just not sure what's wrong with me.    I love the Beatles and I love Led Zeppelin and I love The Beatles and I like Led Zeppelin,  but I just don't like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I like Robert Johnson. I like his songs. I like his music. I like his voice. I like his soul. The thing that really gets me about Robert Johnson's music is his message. I have never heard someone sing so much about love, and the pain of love, and the pain and destruction that can come to the one that is loved.  He speaks of love, but he speaks of it in a positive light, because he is not talking about the bad things that can happen to a person who loves someone.  He is talking about the good.  He is talking about the positive things that will happen to you if you choose the right person.  He is speaking of love, but he is speaking of it in a very positive way.  I want people to know that there are people who are there for you, not just for themselves. There are people who are there for you, and they are there for you to make the world a better place, so that the people that are following them will have a better life.  Don't listen to anyone who says that they will always be there for you, because that is what they are talking about.  Robert Johnson is a man who lives his life by his heart, and you can do the same thing by your heart.  If you choose to follow someone, and you choose to live by your heart, you will live forever.  No one can take that away from you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The group of boys are excellent voices.  I had the great opportunity to hear Libera at the church in my area of the Twin Cities last Sunday.    I was very impressed with his message and delivery.  The songs are very nice, but the music is not very complex.  It is a good CD, but should be taken to the church with a big smile and a great attitude.  This would be an excellent message for the church.

Thank you, Libera and his band.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I recently purchased a copy of this CD on Amazon.com and I was really excited to look at the cover. To my amazement I saw that the CD was covered with stickers. I had no idea that they had such a thing in their records! I bought the CD thinking it was a new copy and I'm disappointed with my purchase. I had to return it to them because the stickers were covering up the cover. I'm hoping that Amazon will fix this problem.

Amazon review: the recording is very good, all the notes and voice are clear. The song is really good, but the song is not that great.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Many people ask me why I don't include the songs on the CD as a separate release.  There are many reasons, none of them good enough to include the songs on the CD as a separate release.  I do include the songs on the CD as a separate release in the hope that people get the opportunity to listen to different songs on the CD.  I feel that it is important to give people the opportunity to get their hands on different songs and hear them in a different way.  Many people ask me why I don't include the songs on the CD on a separate release, other than my pride in having the songs on the CD.  I include the songs on the CD as a separate release because I believe that many people can learn new things from listening to the songs on the CD, that many people can learn new things by listening to the songs on the CD, and that in order to make a collection of the songs, you have to have different songs on it.  The songs on the CD are not the only songs that are on the CD, they are only the first songs that were recorded, and the other songs were added later.  The songs on the CD are the first songs that were recorded for "Waltz of the Western Stars," and that are the only songs that are on the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
