Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I love the way this album opens, with a slow reggae groove, played with a slight groove and a nice little touch of melody. I also love how the song fades out, and the bass and drums take over, for the rest of the song. The song itself is a very basic, repetitive song, without much of a hook or anything. I've been searching for a good, simple hip hop song to listen to recently, and this is a good one.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I'm a bit surprised by the mixed reviews here, as The Weeknd has proven himself to be a great artist in the past with Blue Room, My Dear Melancholy, and most recently, Kiss Land. "Starstruck" is a very catchy song, and i think it's the only song on the album that i really liked. Very much in line with his early work on Red, which is also very good. I don't necessarily agree with the statement that Farrah's voice is overproduced, as her vocals on the track are strong but not overused. Farrah has a very unique sound to her voice and it's not overused. She has a nice quality to her voice, but not overly loud or overproduced. The band is good as well, although I don't really like the piano sounds on a couple songs. Overall, an enjoyable album.

I have been through a lot of different opinions over the last couple of years. From one thing to the next. Each one of them have been able to make me feel a little bit more prepared for my decision. I have found that the following people have been of great help:

I was so thrilled to see that my little girl had her first ballet recital. I was able to attend it with my mom. My mom was so excited to hear my little girl perform her first ballet program. Her ballet teacher was so patient as she patiently put my little girl through the program. The only negative thing that I did was that I was told to wear a dress to the recital.

My mom went to the recital with me. I was so excited to see her. I was so anxious to hear her singing. I was so excited to watch my little girl perform. I was so excited to see mom's smiling face.

My mom and I would talk about what happened that day. She would tell me how she was able to get through it and how she was able to be supportive and not judgmental. I was so confused and so happy to be there. My mom would tell me how much she loves me and how excited she is to see me grow as a dancer. I was so excited to have a place to share my joy and to know mom is excited for me.

That was the first time that I truly felt like a part of something.

I am so grateful for the words that my mom and I shared. I am so grateful to be able to share my joy and my excitement. I am grateful for a mom who is willing to make sure that I am not alone as I feel that she is always there for me. I am grateful for my sister who has always been there for me and who has shared the same joys and hardships with me. I am grateful for a friend who shares the same excitement for me. I am grateful for a family who can be there for me through anything.

As I was looking through the photos that I took from my vacation, I was so confused by the fact that I have never taken a vacation. The pictures that I took the first day were all very ordinary. I could hardly tell that I was taking pictures of something special. The photos that I took the second day were all very similar to one another except for one. The one that I took the last day was so different and so amazing.

I can't recall the reason as to why I took those pictures but I believe that it has to do with the fact that I am so excited to see my mom that I was able to capture her smile. I have never had this much excitement for my mom and I have never photographed her in this manner. I am so excited for her that I am able to see her smile.

I just can't wait to see what my mom's next adventure will be. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to wait to see my mom's next adventure. I know that I'm going to be able to wait because I have been waiting for so long.

I am so excited for all of the adventures that I am going to have with my mom. I am so excited for all of the adventures that I am going to be able to see with my mom. I am so excited for all of the adventures that my mom is going to have with me. I am so excited for all of the adventures that my mom has with me. I am so excited for all of the adventures that I'm going to be able to share with my mom. I am so excited for all of the adventures that we are going to share together. I am so excited for all of the adventures that my mom is willing to share with me.

I am so excited to see my mom's smile at her birthday party. I am so excited to see my mom's smile at her upcoming birthday party. I am so excited to see my mom's smile at my upcoming birthday party.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat.

Amazon review: I had my first experience with the 'This Is A Good Song' by Al Cart & The D.P.D. in the late 1970s. So I don't know what happened to them since. I am not sure what type of music they played in the early 80s but I don't think they played a whole lot of it in the early 80s. However I do know that I did buy the 7 inch in 1979 and it was on one of the later records by Al Cart & The D.P.D. on vinyl. I believe the record is called This Is A Good Song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Yes, I got this album, first time with Al Cart and D.P.D. in the early 80s and it was a real disappointment and I never went back to buy any of their albums. They were great for a short time and then they were gone. I don't know why I've been getting a lot of Al Cart releases lately. There is nothing about the music that speaks to me.

Amazon review: I first heard this group through a cassette tape somewhere. I think it was a cassette copy of an LP that was in the library. I loved the sound of the vocals and the guitar playing was awesome. I thought that I would like to buy this album from the library, but it was too expensive. I couldn't find it when I went to look for it, but I still had the tape in the library. I then got a used copy of the CD from a friend, and it was still too pricey for me. But I got the "Best of" from Al Cart, and it was too good to pass up. This album is simply great. The music is funky and fun, and the lyrics are a little bit edgy and funny. You will love this album!

Amazon review: I was a fan of Disco music in the 80's. I loved the way those bands played together. When I became a bit older and found out that Al Cart and the D.P.D. played music together, I was excited. I had never heard their music before, and I was really excited to listen to it. The music was different, but the sound of the music was the same. I had never seen them perform live, so I didn't really know what to expect. I guess the music was a bit too different for me to get into their music, but I was really happy when I heard their music. I ended up getting this CD, and I had no idea what to expect. I was expecting something very different from Al Cart & the D.P.D., but the music on this album was exactly what I thought it would be. I knew that I would like this album because I like their music. There wasn't a single song that I didn't like. I thought it was a really good album to buy. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes Disco music.

Amazon review: I have been looking for some good music for a long time. The first album that I ever heard was "This Is A Good Song" by Al Cart & The D.P.D. I was amazed that anyone would put out something like this. I'm glad that it was given to me. This album is very good. The music is very funky and it makes you feel good. Their music is very different, but it's not so different that it could be considered bad. I like alot of other albums that I have heard, but I don't think that they are as good as this album. I have been interested in buying some of this band's other albums, but I have been stuck on their "This Is A Good Song" album. I have been holding off on buying their other albums because I thought that the quality of this album was too good to pass up. I ended up buying the "Best of" album of the band, and it was better

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.
