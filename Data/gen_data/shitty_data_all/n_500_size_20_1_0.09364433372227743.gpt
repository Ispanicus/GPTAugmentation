Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

I've been listening to him since he was in his "prime" and will continue to listen to him as long as he continues to sing.  This is my favorite album of his and I love this one on CD.  I love it and I cannot wait to get my hands on more recordings of him.  "The Best" as they say!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  It is an easy listen album.  It is mostly in Spanish.  Tony Bennett has been singing and performing songs in Spanish for years and years.  He has some great songs in Spanish.  This album is on the Spanish language side.  The songs in this album are very easy to sing and the songs are easy to listen to.  For the most part, they are very easy to sing.  The only exception is the song "Love Stinks", because it is a song for Spanish speakers.  It's a little hard for a non-Spanish speaker to sing and not laugh.  I think that's why it's a good album.  It's not that hard to sing and you can still enjoy the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A good album.  The only things that I don't like about this album is that there are more than 10 songs on the CD and that there is a part where he sings the words to "We Shall Overcome" but he doesn't sing the words to the song.  I would recommend this CD, but only for those that want to learn about Tony Bennett.  Most of his songs are for a Spanish audience and most of his songs are in Spanish.

I think he could sing them better, he just doesn't do it very well.  But I like his Spanish songs.  I just don't think they are very good.  But I do like his Spanish songs.

Amazon review: Hello,
I'm going to review The Album by The Doors. I'm not sure if the reviewers will like the album because it's simple and boring, but I think it has to be said that this album is a very strong rock album, and the sound of the guitars is very hard rock. The drums are fast and have lots of speed, but when it comes to the instruments the guitars are really hard and loud.
The lyrics for the songs are very deep and there's a lot of deep meanings. I didn't understand a lot of the lyrics though, but I really liked them. The songs have a lot of instruments, and each instrument is really important to the song. The last song is really really sad, but the song is very important because of the lyrics. The vocals are great, and it shows the emotion of the song.
I'm glad I bought this album because it's very rare to find a hard rock album with a deep meaning. I think the album is very cool because it's one of the rare hard rock albums that has a good sound. I don't know if you can make it sound good as a rock album, but it sounds very good. This album really shines because of the guitar sound and the sound of all the instruments. The guitars are very loud and there's lots of energy.
The songs are really good and have a lot of energy and are very short. The album is very short, but I don't think it's a bad album because it's short. This is one of the coolest hard rock albums that I have ever listened to. I like the album very much because it has a really good sound, and it has a lot of energy. The songs are very powerful and the lyrics are very deep. I thought the album was boring, but I like the album because it has a good sound. I think this album is a good album because it's very rare to find a hard rock album with a good sound. I think the album is a good album because it has a good sound. I think the album is a good album because it's very rare to find a hard

Amazon review: I really like this album.  One of the best Dylan albums I've ever listened to.  It's hard to believe that it took Bob three years to complete the album.  This collection is amazing.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

I have listened to it many times.  It's just as wonderful as I had heard.  I really enjoyed the song "The Stranger".  It's a very special song.  I just wish I could have more of the songs on this record.  However, it's very enjoyable to listen to.  I would buy it again.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  It's one of the best I've listened to.  I like that the songs are a little bit more upbeat than usual.  I like all the songs on this album, but I especially like the songs "Fool For You" and "If You Don't Know" because they are very sweet.  They are the best songs that I've heard from this band.  The only song that I don't like was "The Stranger".  It's a very nice song, but it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the songs.  I don't know what to think about it. I hope that I can find more of these great songs to listen to.  I would purchase this again.

Amazon review: Really good song!  This is the best album that I have heard from this band.  I really like the song "All Of Me".  It's very nice.  I like the song "If You Don't Know".  This song is not a good song, but it is a good song.  It's really nice.  "The Hardest Part" is my favorite song.  I like it a lot.  My favorite song is "The Stranger" because it's a very nice song.  I like the song "All You Need Is Love" because it's a very nice song.  I like the song, "All You Need Is Love", the very best song.  I like the song "You'll Know" because it's a good song.  It's very nice.  The last song I would like to listen to is "The Longest Walk".  That's my favorite song.  I like the song "All You Need Is Love".  I like the song "If You Don't Know".  That's a nice song.  I like the song "If You Don't Know".  I like the song "Take It Easy".  That's a nice song.  I like the song "Fool For You".  I like "If You Don't Know".  That's a nice song.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: After listening to this album for the 6th time, I am still not sure what I like about it.  I have listened to the Killers and this album for the last 4 months, and I am still not sure what I like about it.  I can understand the reason behind the lack of variety, but I'm not sure if the lack of variety makes me dislike the album or just not "get" it. So my question is, after listening to this album for the last 4 months, what is one thing that you like about it?  I think I am supposed to like it, but I just don't.  I love Ozzy, but this album is not his best.  And I love "Collide" but I can't stand the "feat." thing.  I think "Unbreakable" (which you are supposed to love) is the most boring song ever.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

The songs have a lot of "clichés" in them, and the voice is on top of them.  You're not going to hear that on a lot of other recordings.  Susan Boyle has a very deep voice that can be monotonous in a lot of songs.  I don't think it's a "bad" voice, but it's not the most enjoyable voice on the CD.  She's not a "good" singer either.  Just not my cup of tea.  I don't think it's a "bad" singer either.  She's not a "good" singer either.  She is by far the best singer on this CD.  She is by far the best singer on this CD.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is nothing here to write home about. It's a bad "Christmas" album in the vein of the others, but it's Christmas music anyway. I can't think of a reason to buy this album when all you have to do is buy Christmas music for the season.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this album to be disappointing. The song selection was ok, but the lyrics were terrible.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This Christmas album does not have a good track. It's a collection of songs with no real meaning that you might hear in a church, but it doesn't have much else going for it. It's the type of Christmas album that will go to the junk box, and that's the sad part.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this album because I thought it was "The Gift," but was surprised to hear the name "The Gift" in the description. I'm not sure whether I was disappointed or disappointed at hearing the name "The Gift."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't like Christmas music. I'm not a fan of the "feel good" type of music, so this Christmas album was very disappointing to me. I know some people like it, but I don't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't buy this album. Not because I don't like Christmas music, but because I don't like the song "It's Christmastime" more than the rest of the album. It's not bad, but it isn't anything special.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The best Christmas album I've ever heard. I've tried to listen to the other Christmas albums I've purchased on the Christmas Music website, and I've found that they're all very good, but I can't listen to this one for more than 5 seconds. This is the best Christmas album I've ever heard.

Amazon review: I bought this album to see if it was as good as the other albums I had heard. The music was great, and the lyrics were good, but the Christmas song is awful. I would rather listen to the other Christmas albums, but I doubt I would buy that album again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Beatles and I have many of their songs on CD. So when I found out there was a video version of the whole album, I was very excited. I've listened to the album many times and each time I find something new. This was my favorite song! It was fun to perform and I enjoyed it so much. The song is really upbeat and has great energy. I love how the drummer plays the drums and I love the beat behind the music. It is a very upbeat song. The guitar solo was very nice! The lyrics to this song are easy to understand and the vocals are fantastic. I highly recommend listening to this song and purchasing the whole album.
