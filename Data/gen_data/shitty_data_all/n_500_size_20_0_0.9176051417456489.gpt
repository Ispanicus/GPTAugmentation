Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: This is a great album.  It is filled with great original songs.  My only gripe is the fact that King Kong did not appear on side A.  I guess he didn't want to appear on a bad-sounding album.  It's a shame because this is a great album.  The band sounds great and I like the songs.  If you like a little bit of good old rock n' roll, you should check this album out.  I'm sure the band will be back.

Amazon review: Just a typical rock n' roll album.  I really don't know why they didn't include King Kong on side A.  But I guess they didn't want him to appear on a bad-sounding album.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the most interesting releases to come out of New York City in the last two years.  The first song is a bluesy, slinky blues with a strong rhythm section that moves the song forward into a groove that is unlike anything else I've heard in a long time.  The second song is by far the strongest of the 4 tracks, and combines elements of traditional blues with a very interesting mix of heavy metal and hard rock that is sure to please fans of both genres.  The final two tracks are very good, with the first one the best of them all.  I find it to be very cool, and it has a very cool bluesy groove that is quite unique.  I'd love to find a way to play this song with a band, but as of right now I'm not sure how to do that. I hope to find a way to play it some day.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an interesting record and worth a listen.  The first two tracks are very good, with the first one being the weakest of the two and the second track being the strongest of the two.  I would listen to the first track first.  I don't know why the producers of this project put the instrumental first track last, but I don't know how I would explain this to my kids.  They would be like, "What?  How can you listen to an instrumental first track?"  I would never put an instrumental first track last, so why do you?

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album is a fine representation of the band's sound.  That's to be expected, since as a band they have a very distinctive sound.  However, this album's best song, "Killing Me Softly" has a great melody, and is a great song, but I think the lyrics are too much of a downer.  This song is about a man who loved a woman, but his love was not reciprocated, and consequently he killed her.  This type of story is not unusual in rock or indie music, even in the 60s, but the lyrics would make a good movie trailer, so they should have said something like "He killed her because she loved someone else".  I mean, at least they can say that they put out a rock album.  Also, this song has a great, memorable guitar interlude, but the guitars sound too loud.  The chorus is ok, but the bridge is just too big.  I would suggest lowering the volume a bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to be honest.  I don't really listen to this band.  My mom always tells me that the three songs that I listen to the most are "Bad Habit" or "Lithium", and I don't really care for them.  They're just boring.  I'm not even sure why I've never heard "The World" before.  Why would they put out a decent album and then put that one song out?  I'm not in the mood for a boring song.  I've heard "I Ran" once, and it's really good.  "The World" is the only song I would even consider listening to.  I think the only reason I would listen to this album is if I would like the "original" version, and I've never heard it.  I guess I'll just have to listen to the other songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never liked this band.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's the music they play.  Maybe it's the people who listen to their music.  I just find them to be very average, and nothing special.  They don't really have any catchy songs.  They're basically trying to make a record, and they're not really putting anything worthwhile out.  I'm just not going to listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not bad, especially the first half of it.  I thought the band had more in common with the music I was used to.  I had heard it before, but I thought it was a little too bland and predictable.  I expected something more.  But the band didn't make any real musical statement.  The lyrics were pretty good, and I would say the melodies were catchy, but the songwriting was not very memorable.  I think it would be a good album to play to a room full of friends.  It will probably get a lot of spins, because it is a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This band is a great way to introduce new people to the world of music.  For people who have never tried or bought a CD, the songs are not too hard to understand.

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.

Amazon review: This album does not have a single song that I liked that I couldn't find something like it on another album.  The music is very repetitive and boring.  I would recommend this album to a friend if they have an emotional need to be reminded of the 80's.

Amazon review: This is one of the more interesting albums of the last year.  I wish I could listen to a song for an hour and not have to stop.  The lyrics are weak and have no sense of place.

I do not recommend this album for anyone else.

I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I bought this album because I like the name and the album cover and the fact that it had to do with death and religion. It's a bit overpriced for the album that it is, but the album art and cover was good, and the album has some good songs on it that I really liked. I'm not sure about the vocals or the production on it. I don't know what to expect from it, and I don't even really know if the vocals are as good as they say they are. I'm not sure if I will ever like Korn, but I do like this album.

Amazon review: I started listening to Korn in college. I remember buying the first album on cassette, and then the second album on CD. Then I started listening to this album (with the cassettes) while I was in a band with a friend, and then I started listening to Korn in my car on the way to a show. I have always been a big fan of heavy metal but never listened to Korn as much as I have listened to other bands. I have listened to this album through about 5 or 6 times. I still enjoy it. I don't know what it is about this album that I love, but I love it.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.
