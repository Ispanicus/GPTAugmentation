Amazon review: Bought this one when it was new.  A great double album of a neglected band.  Just listen to Budd Johnson for a start.  The great drummer Alvin Burroughs, Shorty Baker and the young Mr. B, are also on hand.  Grab it quickly.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.

Amazon review: Lyrics are good.  But the songs are, well, just filler.  The album is a great collection of songs, but only for the very few who love to hear Elton John sing.  It is a bit too long and repetitive to be a great album.  The songs are mostly well written, but the lyrics are often just okay.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs about the trials and tribulations you will face when you fall in love.  This one is really a great collection of songs about how wonderful it is to be a lover and how you will never be alone.  I think it was a better album for 70's EJ fans.  But for those of you who love 70's EJ and don't mind being a little repetitive, this one is a good listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Lyrics are okay.  No really.  This one is a collection of songs about how wonderful it is to be a lover and how no one will ever be alone.  It's okay, but not great.  It's not really a song collection, but I guess it is a collection of songs and even if it's a collection of songs about how wonderful it is to be a lover, it still doesn't seem to have enough songs.  Too many songs on this album that are just filler.  And the song "We Don't Talk Anymore" is the one that gets stuck in my head every time I hear it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album contains some of Elton John's best songs in years.  This is the only album recorded by Elton John that I have listened to frequently.  The songs are all written by Elton and are not about any of his personal life.  They are about the trials and tribulations of being a lover and of being a romantic.  Some of the songs are about the trials and tribulations of being a lover that will end in heartbreak, and some of the songs are about the trials and tribulations of being a lover who will end in heartbreak.  This is a great album to listen to, but if you are in need of a classic Elton John album, then you should consider purchasing Rock of the Westies.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great collection.  The songs are mostly good and some are even great.  This is definitely a great album for fans of 70's Elton John.  I suggest that you buy it as soon as you can because it will be gone soon.  Not available on the Amazon Prime program, but purchased from a local music store.  It is available in other stores in the area, but there is no way to know where it will be available next.  So, if you are in need of a great Elton John album, then this is the one.

Amazon review: This is the first album I have listened to since my divorce.  And believe me, if I could remember what happened in the first six months after my divorce, I would.

Amazon review: Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this song, the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me, but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song, one of his favorites, he thinks it's really romantic etc.... Not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so I decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix CD for Valentine's day. I've always known the lyrics were romantic, but they have more meaning for me now.

Amazon review: I fell in love with Ann Wilson the first time I heard Dreamboat Annie.  36 years later, Ann Wilson sounds even better.  Wether you are a Heart fan, or have never heard the group before, this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Once I'd downloaded this song, I felt deceived by the sample clip available here. Cincotti definitely has potential, but he ruined what could've been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range. He sounded rather screechy. The title track was also somewhat misleading, because it led me to expect a slow, tender seduction song, not a sad one. I do think Peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Horrible annoying sound. I disliked this tremendously.  I kept hoping the sound would change but was just the same 10 second sound over and over.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of the "new" Beatles, then you're gonna love this song.  The Beatles were some of the last great pop music acts to be popular.  The Beatles were a great band, with a great sound and songs we can still enjoy today.  This is one of my favorite songs.  I love the guitar sound, and the fact that there is a hint of something being said.  But the vocals are just too faint and too weak to be a great song.  And it is the same 3:50 song every time.  I love the Beatles and I love this song but this is my least favorite song. It would be more enjoyable to listen to if you're a fan of the Beatles.

Amazon review: Made in AUT in 1996, Serial# 33215-2, Playing Time 51:45 This is album #9 from Canada's self-proclaimed "Metal Queen", and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums. "Emotional Rain", her previous album, displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors, but this present album switches gears into what I call the "nowhere rock" genre. I like LA's singing, and "LA&2P" demonstrates her talents.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So I was a big fan of K. Michelle's first two albums, and I've been waiting for her comeback since the release of her first solo album in 2005. The album "I'm Not That Kind of Guy" is the perfect reflection of her music, yet at the same time it was my favorite album of her first two albums. This album is definitely a return to her old sound, and the album title and songs reflect her old style perfectly.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My main problem with K. Michelle is that she is a very good vocalist, but the lack of a good instrumentalist makes it difficult for her to be consistent. (I have heard this album on Spotify, and I have no idea what it is.) The instrumentals are good, but I'm not sure how much of it is her voice and how much is her guitar. There may be a lot of instrumentals that are sung by K. Michelle.

###
Amazon review: This is K. Michelle's comeback album, and I am very happy to see her back on my favorite singer/songwriter albums list.

Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: I like bar and band versions of songs, but this has too much "not funny" in it for me.  It's one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat, sleeping with your cousin, sister, brother, dad, or whatever else is in this music.  Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.

Amazon review: I feel like this song is better than most of the other ones on the album.  It's not that the album is bad, but it's a pretty average album overall.  The song does have a nice chord progression, but the lyrics are just plain awkward.  The song is sung by a guy, so it doesn't have the same problems as a female singing in a rock band.  The first verse is funny.  After that, it's just not funny.  The last three lines have some good ideas, but the rest of the lyrics are just flat.  The song was meant to be a parody of a bad movie or something, but the rest of this album is just one of those bad movie parodies that are too lazy to make it their own.  There are a few good songs on here, but most of the album is just plain bad.

Amazon review: This is the band's third album (it's their second album to not have the song "The World Is Yours" as an early release), and the longest on it is the last song on side one.  I know that one is a joke, but it would have been better placed on the other side, or at least on the third side.  It's a little weird that it's the first song on this album, and is the longest on it, but I guess it's just better to have the first song on the album be the longest.  The song seems just like any other songs that we have heard on the radio, and it's not really that funny or anything.  The only thing that makes this song not horrible is the guitar.  That's it.  Nothing else.  I'm surprised it's not on the last track on side one, but that's probably because the album doesn't have a good third side.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know why I feel this song is so bad.  I don't even know how to describe it.  I just don't get it.  It's not that the band is bad, or the songs are bad, but this song just seems so out of place.  That one note that you hear each time the song goes over is the only thing I can put my finger on.  I guess the song could be better than it is, but I have no idea what would be better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is too simple.  I mean, it's not like they are trying to be boring, but just like they are trying to be boring, the song is so boring and simple that it's kind of hard to take it seriously.  They could have made this song a little more interesting, or just a little more clever.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a decent song.  It's just not a good song.  I think that it could have used better lyrics, or a better arrangement.  The music is not so bad, it just doesn't fit well into this song.  It's not a bad song, just not a good one.  I would have preferred a song that was a little more interesting.

Amazon review: I like the song, but I have no idea what it's about.  It's not the best song they have done, but it's not the worst either.  There are a few good things about this song, but the rest of it is just so...  Just so...  It doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album.  This song is just boring.

Amazon review: My mom got this on her birthday.  She likes these kind of songs that are about her, and I thought that it had some good things about it.  The song is about the guy who is going to die, but he doesn't want to go.  I like how it's more personal and more personal and more personal.  It's like the story of someone who is going to die.  I think it's just a really personal song.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

###
Amazon review: I didn't know what to expect.  My expectations were low.  The way this band sounds more like a band that is a part of a larger cultural phenomenon than like a band that is a part of its own culture.  I didn't expect the band to have the ability to change the way the audience felt.  It was more like getting a hug from a friend who is in the same band.  A hug that you know won't end with hugging.  That's the only way I can describe it.  The message is positive, but the execution is terrible.  All my life I've had to struggle to find my identity.  I don't know what I am, but I have been told that I am a  'hip-hop girl'.  I don't know what that means, but I've tried to learn what that means, but nothing seems to make sense to me.  The message is positive, but the execution is terrible.

I look forward to what this group has in store for us.

This album is a little more upbeat that most of Pearl Jam's previous albums.

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever heard a "songs I've always wanted to hear" album.  I've never heard any other Pearl Jam album sound just like this one.  I've never heard a Pearl Jam album sound this good.  This is the best Pearl Jam album I've ever heard.  I love the fact that this album is full of different types of music.  The sound is so rich and full.  I can't help but think that this is the kind of album that will always be appreciated by a huge fan base.  I also love the fact that this album is totally different from the other Pearl Jam albums.  The message is positive, but the execution is terrible.

Amazon review: I want to love this band but they are not as good as their previous albums.  They've lost their way.  They've been selling out of every album they release.  They're so good now, we love them.  But they're not as good as they used to be.  Not even close.  This album has no soul.  No substance.  This album is trash.  It had a chance to be good, but this album is a joke.  This band has lost their way.

WTF is wrong with you people for giving this CD a high rating.  Seriously, it is DUMB.  Seriously folks, if you want to listen to a porn with no video, this is it. There isn't any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music.  I cannot believe this CD was so highly rated. Seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review, just unbelievable.

Amazon review: Not to be confused with his "The Best of Tank", this one is actually the best of him.  It's a nice collection of songs all of which have a good beat but the one that really stands out is "A. N. U.".  It's a really good song and it has a great beat that works really well.  Tank is a very talented writer who's music is always good to listen to but this one really stands out.  If you love his work, this is a good album to add to your collection.

Amazon review: A great follow-up to her award winning duet with Jason Aldean and her TV show "Duets," Kelly sings with famed country artist Vince Gill to create a truly lovely song.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I would not say that it is worth the money to buy.  A few times I have had to turn the volume up so that I can hear the singer.  I have not listened to the entire album.  I would rather have this album, but the songs are not that great.  This album is really good but it is not worth at least $80.  I have bought other albums that are worth a lot more than $80.  I think the songs are good but the album is not for $80.

Amazon review: A great album.  This album, along with the first album, have been a complete surprise.  The songs are good, but not great.  There are songs that make you think, while others you just laugh at and some are just plain weird.  But the good thing is the album is not just the music and the songs.  The album has a life of its own as you get to hear the songs from each artist that are featured.  You hear the songs in their entirety and this is a great album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who has heard of the Beatles.  The album will be a great addition to any Beatles fan's collection.

Amazon review: I loved the first album.  This album is only a great follow-up.  It comes out with a new twist on the Beatles.  It may be a little over the top but the songs are great.  I have to give it 3 stars if I have to.  There is a new element to the songs.  As you would expect, the Beatles songs are here and there are a few songs that are not the originals.  The album is not really a great album.  It has a few songs that are good and a few that are not.  The album is worth a listen but it is not worth the price.  I was just happy to have been able to hear some of the songs that the first album was missing.  It is good to have it but I would not recommend it.  It is definitely worth having as a follow-up.

The two discs are interspersed with songs that are more upbeat and upbeat, such as "I'm Just a Singer in a Band" and "I Love You (I Love You So)".

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Amazon review: A wonderful album, but there are a few really stupid things about it- one is that it is only available on vinyl.  Also, it is so short, only 10 tracks, the rest of the album is only 14 tracks.  And even though it is a 5 disc set, the first 3 discs are only 1.5 discs.  This is a waste of CD space and money.  Another stupid thing is that they have only released it in digital format.  This is the 7th CD in a 4 CD set, the other 3 are in double-CD format. It is the same thing, a waste of CD space.  I am willing to pay for a double CD if I am going to have to pay a ton of extra money for a 4 CD set just to get a CD of this 10 track album.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: I found this cd at a thrift shop in my area today and it is a great tune. I would not hesitate to purchase it as it is worth every penny. The song "Don't Fall in Love with a Homo" is quite a departure from the usual type of dance music. This is a very nice piece of work. I have found that sometimes CDs are scratched and they just don't work right. This I just found out today and I am very happy as it played fine on the CD itself. I think the music is really quite good.

Amazon review: ACCK! Michael Allen Harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saws. RUN AND HIDE! It sounds like. sorta like weird whistling. If the sawing was taken out it would have been an O.K album. I rated it 1 star because there was no -200 star. :(. All of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible. I think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad. If you're wondering, this CD was free at the Michael Allen Harrison Christmas Concert and I THOUGHT it would be decent.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I love the band. I was surprised at how much good music was on there. I guess that's why I like it so much.

Amazon review: I have an issue with this album. All the songs are good, but there are some that are awful.

This is a good album if you like heavy music. It is not an incredible album, but it is not horrible.

Amazon review: Found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my Mexican Vacation folder on my personal website. It fit the bill perfectly as it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that does not overwhelm the web browsing experience, but was a delightful addition instead. I've since listened to some more from this artist, and liked most of them, but this particular song is my favorite.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: This is not a good song.  It's a bad song.  It's a very bad song with terrible lyrics.  I don't know why they put this song on the album.  They probably thought there was a good chance that this song would be good.  They're wrong.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is by far the best song on the album.  This song has lyrics, it's a great melody, and it's a good performance from a talented female artist.  The song is a love song written by an unknown English songwriter.  Eleanor has a beautiful voice and it is easy to sing along.  It has a beautiful melody and the lyrics are very good.

Amazon review: This song is actually a cover of "Baby, I Love Your Way" written by the great American singer and songwriter, Mariah Carey.  I think this is a great song.  Eleanor McCain's voice is beautiful.  Her voice sounds like a young Mariah Carey.  This song is actually a song that Mariah wrote for her ex-husband, Nick Cannon.  This song is not bad.  The only problem is, it's probably going to sound terrible when it is played on a radio as a cover of a song that Mariah wrote for Nick Cannon.

I love my husband.  I love my husband.  I love my friends.  I love everything.  I love everything.  I love my husband.  I love my husband.  If I didn't have my husband I don't know what I would do.  I would do anything to have him.  I would do anything to have him.  I would do everything if I didn't have him.  I would do everything if I didn't have him!
