Amazon review: I pre ordered this record, so you can imagine the amount of excitement I had when it arrived. I was all but kissed the delivery man when it came! I ran straight up to my record machine and played it, probably around 3 times before giving poor dierks a break. I listened to the record about 5 times after that before the unthinkable happened. "It's different for girls" began to SKIP! I was in shambles! On my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was skipping!

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).

If it takes romance to make that happen, so much the better.

Amazon review: Nothing new here, except the packaging. This collection is the first time inclusion of "singles" from their recent lackluster album "That's Why God Made The Radio". The reason I highlight "singles" is because, what the heck is a single these days? Although there was actually a 45 rpm 7" vinyl "single" issued of "That's Why God Made The Radio", it was just issued only for, probably, collectors like me. The other new "single", "Isn't It Time", only exists on the album.

Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing!

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices.

Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

It's not one of his big hits.  It's got a good feel to it.  I really like the harmonies.  It's so good, that I can't really find anything negative to say about the album because it's so good.  It's not so good, but it's good.  It's not so good, but it's good

He said he only had one request of me, "Dad, promise me that if I should pass before you that you'll play song at my funeral." Well what could I say but, "Only if you'll do the same for me son."  Very touching day for us. Thanks Guys.

Amazon review: My son brought home his 3-year-old daughter for the first time this weekend. After a short visit, he came to pick her up and she was already asleep. When he returned to the car to drive away, he found that her face and body had become contorted in a manner only seen on the human body in slow motion. When he stopped, his daughter's body would twist violently from side to side, making it look like someone was pulling on her arms and face in a slow motion manner. He pulled over and got out of the car to walk her to the back door of the house, but she was no longer even moving. He immediately called 911, but there was no one at the house. He then called the police to the neighbors and asked them to help, but they were too far away. He called the doctors to the hospital to have her checked out, but she was still unresponsive at the hospital. He then called the school to see if there was anything they could do, but it was too late. When I heard about this, I knew she was dead.

Amazon review: I have a friend that is a professional musician. He is a very good musician, but when it comes to music of any kind of tempo, he is lost. I have to sit and listen to him play a song on the phone, or sing a song with me, and I just can't tell what he is doing and can't figure out how to get it to work for me. I have to sit and listen to him play and sing and I am lost.

Amazon review: This was my first time purchasing a digital download from Amazon. I have purchased several other items from Amazon, but this is the first time I have purchased anything from this site. I have purchased a few other items from Amazon, but for the most part, I am only interested in the best of the best. I was surprised that this was the best of the best. The song is not of the highest quality. It is extremely low-end. I was hoping to find the best of the best, but not this. What you get is a song that sounds low-end and is the same song over and over again. The sound quality is terrible. I would have returned it, but I was hoping that I would be able to return it with no issues. I am disappointed, and will not buy another item from Amazon.

Amazon review: I have an old Sony Walkman, and i have been looking for a digital music player for my car, for the past few weeks. I finally found one. After I played the first song, I noticed that it was not playing my CD, or MP3. I emailed the company and asked for a refund and they emailed me back and said it was a problem with the player, and asked me to please send pictures of the player to prove it was the player. I did. I sent pictures as to what it looks like and what it is like inside. I also had a picture of the screen. I received an email back with a response stating I needed to come to a store to get a replacement. I went to the store and asked the man to look inside the player and look at the screen. He did. He said the screen was fine, and it was the player that was the issue. I asked if there was a warranty on the player. He said there was not a warranty, and he would not be able to give me a refund or exchange. I told him I would have to return the product. He then told me that I could return it, or I could send it back to Amazon. I sent it back to Amazon. They refunded my money, but then told me that I could send the item back to the store if I wanted to. I told them that I thought it was the most annoying thing in the world to have to send back a product. They said they were only going to give me a refund and would not give me a refund or exchange. Here is the kicker. I found a different player that I thought was going to be the same exact model. It was. I called the store back and asked for a refund and a refund and exchange. They said they only refunded the money. I then asked how much money I would have to pay. They said that the store would be happy to refund that amount and exchange the product. I told them I am not in the business of buying products in hopes of getting a refund. I said I am in the business of buying products in hopes of getting a good product, a cheap product, or something in between. I told them that I would be

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

Amazon review:  If you're in a band that plays a lot of country rock/country blues and rock, this is an old-school country song, in the vein of Merle Haggard.  All of the instruments are played by the same guy, but the vocalist, a female, has a more high-pitched tone than what I hear from Merle, and I can't seem to find anyone else who sings that style.  This is also a good song for a praise team, and a children choir get you blessing.  The guitar solo is a little weak, but the chorus is great!

Amazon review: This guy is terrific.  However, this CD and his other solo album RAMIN are exactly the same in content.  Every song on one is on the other in the exact order. and I bought both thinking they'd be different.  Really disappointed that I bought the same CD twice with separate TITLES.  Great performer. probably a decent guy.  But let's take one of those off the market!  It makes this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or "sneaky".

I love how he tells us he's not a religious person but he does pray.  I love how he sings "I love that song" over and over again.  I love that he says he would have joined the military earlier.

Amazon review: I listened to this song by Jeremy Camp when I was a child.  I loved it so much I couldn't stop listening.  I still love this song when I am alone, but when I am with the family I don't get as much out of it.  I don't think the lyrics are very good because they didn't tell us what he was about to do for the first half of the song.  I think the chorus is funny and makes the song memorable.  I think the lyrics are OK, but they don't tell us what he was about to do for the first half of that song.  I think the chorus is funny and makes the song memorable, but the lyrics are not very good.  I don't think Jeremy Camp's vocals are very good.  He's a nice guy, but he's never hit top grade as a vocalist.  I don't think Jeremy Camp's vocals will take me to the top of my list of favourite songs.  I'm glad I have this CD because it has such great memories of my childhood.  I don't even know how it got there.  I really like this song and I plan to listen to it again in the future.

Pimpin' it up!!  This is a great song and I love it!  It is very rhythmic.  It is a dance song.  I would recommend this to all my friends.  I just downloaded it and I am ready to start a party!!!  If you have any friends that are in a similar situation (and you want to make them feel good!) you can give it a try!  It is fun to dance to and the beat keeps you going everytime!  I would love to have you guys over and we can dance to this song!  Enjoy the music and have fun!!!  You will be surprised at how much fun it could be.  It will definitely bring you out of your shell!

The single is called Prince: The Revolution and it features the original version of the song's title track, as well as a new remix by Prince himself. Despite the fact that it was a single released in 1982, the song was already becoming a classic at the time of its release, and has since been covered by other artists and groups. Prince has also covered the song several times, most notably, on the album Around the World in a Day.

The single is also noteworthy for having been the last Prince album to feature the entire production of Prince and the Revolution, with the final two tracks, "In a Heartbeat" and "A Love So Simple", both being produced by Prince himself. The album also featured several other songs that Prince had previously recorded for other artists, including "Wishin' and Hopin'" and "When Doves Cry", which were both also singles released for other artists. In fact, the only song that featured his production was the single "A Love So Simple", which was the second single from the album.

I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks.

Amazon review: If you are reading this review, then you must've been born recently, or stuck in some other time space continuum.  I purchased this tape years ago when Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth were new artists, and this song/album still "bangs" now like it did then.  I'm just updating to digital.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This track is a great example of how music can be completely ruined by someone who doesn't know how to properly edit audio.  It's also proof that the lyrics don't need to be taken at face value.  The song is called "Falling Back" and it's a great example of how people try to copy what they hear, then they totally screw it up.  The opening notes on "Falling Back" were so high that I had to turn down the volume to make sure I could hear it.  After that it sounded like all the other voices were talking in this slow beat that made it sound like the whole song was being sung by one person.  Then all of a sudden the song slowed down just enough so that the vocals couldn't be heard over it.  It's the same thing that happened with the "Let's Go to Mars" version of this song.  The vocal was so high that it drowned out the entire song.  This is a great example of the kind of problems that can happen when a song is recorded improperly in the first place.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Review:  This song was a good choice for my tape, but I wanted to find a way to get rid of the annoying bass and the repetitive drum beat, so I recorded it in my bedroom.  This song is a bit annoying but not as annoying as the song "Falling Back" by the Goo Goo Dolls.  It's a shame that the Goo Goo Dolls put out an album called "Sugar Sugar" in 2010, because they were still the most annoying band I had ever heard.

Amazon review: This song is one of the first times I've been able to listen to a hip hop song that actually sounds bad.  Most "Hip Hop" songs are so good, you forget about the horrible parts.  This song is the opposite of that, in fact.  This song is pretty good, and I actually enjoy it.  I was surprised to learn that it was written by the same guy who wrote "You'll Never Walk Alone" from the Go-goos.  I don't know why the Go-goos released "You'll Never Walk Alone," but I figured that it was probably a bad song, so I kept it for myself.  The song is basically about the "You'll Never Walk Alone" syndrome.  Everyone has it, but it's never really spoken about.  This song is one of the first times I've been able to listen really honestly to the song "You'll Never Walk Alone."  It's like hearing a song about the "You'll Never Walk Alone" syndrome in the middle of a song about sex.  That's how it has to sound, and that's why the song is bad.  The only positive thing about this song is that the chorus is good.  The chorus is pretty good and it's got a nice chorus.  The song is repetitive too, so the song is at its worst when it repeats itself, which is when the song is good.  The whole song is repetitive, but the chorus is good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I first heard this song on the radio and was hooked.  It's one of my personal favorites.  It's just a great song.  I like the fact that it's a slow song, and that it has a great beat.  The lyrics are pretty good too.  I thought that the lyric "You'll never walk alone" was kinda funny, but it made me think of a person that I know and I don't want to say her name because she might be offended.  That is a pretty good lyric, and I think it's great that people use it as a title for a song.  It's a great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This song is good, but it's a pity that the lyrics are so terrible.  The lyrics are very cliche and very generic.  I remember when I first heard this song on the radio, I was like "Who is this song by?".  Then I realized that it was by Kool & The Gang, and it was called "You'll Never Walk Alone".  That's how I first learned the lyrics.  I'm glad that the Go-goos did a version of it and I like the Goo Goo Dolls version better.  This song is good, but the Go-goos version is better.  The Go-goos song is just better.  The Go-goos song is much better.  I still like the Go-goos song better, it has a good beat and they have a good message in it.

So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

I have just learned of a new podcast series, "No Limits on the Airwaves" that follows the same format as the "No Limits on the Water" series, except they are not limited to just the airwaves. This has been a great find for me. I am looking forward to listening to the first episodes. "

Amazon review: I have bought Music through Amazon preferring them to iTunes because because iTunes try to control their music too much.

Amazon review: Very disappointed by this CD which I will probably listen to only once.  Elling's interpretations of most of these terrific songs just grate, and his voice is nothing special.  His butchering of "On Broadway" is particularly heinous.  I'd have given the CD one star except for the really lovely version of Paul Simon's "American Tune".  A waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Full disclosure, I have not listened to this entire album.  It was just too awful.  Look, the bottom line, this album is 40 years too late.  If this has been released in the 1970's when everyone was on psyc drugs, then I'm sure it would've been a HUGE hit.  But this is 2014.  It just doesn't work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Not a true alternative, but it is good for all of the right reasons.  It's funny because everyone I know is a little embarrassed by it.  It's a perfect album to listen to when you're feeling down about the state of the world.  Also, when you like the kind of music that is made for the ages.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I was so excited to hear it, it's my new go-to.  The songs are really interesting, well-written, and the lyrics are very well-written.  "I don't want to live in a world without love" is one of my favorite songs.  It's not particularly an anthem, but it's an anthem all the same.  It's the kind of song that makes you want to hear it again and again.  Really, really good.

Amazon review:  I don't know if I can really say much more than that.  I like hearing what these guys are doing and it keeps me interested.

Amazon review:  The album starts off strong, but the lack of diversity in the lyrics, the songs, and their overall lack of production make it impossible to recommend.  I'm sorry, but these guys are going to have to find a new audience, because I don't think anyone is going to be digging this album.

Amazon review:  This is a great album, but it's not going to be a breakout.  The songs are good, but they don't feel like they belong to an album.

I'd recommend it to a friend.

There is not much to say about this song. It is just a song about how much you love something that you could not have lived without. It is pretty simple, but the lyrics make it even more so.

I would rate this song at 4/5 stars. I love it!! I think it is a very good song, but not a must listen. I recommend you listen, and if you like this song, then go to the next one.
