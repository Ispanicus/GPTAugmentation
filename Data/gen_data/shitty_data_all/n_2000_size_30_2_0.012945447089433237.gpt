Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: The book Think & Grow Rich is a must own. It is book to be read multiple times. That being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone. He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

I got this, because I had a $1 Amazon Mp3 credit awarded for a purchased CD. After skimming through a few other artists, I remembered this song and picked it up.  The acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original, which is a noticeably good thing and I would recommend this track.

Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.

Amazon review: After I had heard David Gilmore talk about this project, I have to admit, I was excited to get my hands on this box set, from one of my Fav. bands. I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image. I find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get my hands on this "Gigantica" set.  I just got done watching David Gilmore perform live for the last few years, so I was anxious to listen to this.  I was really looking forward to playing the guitar and writing the lyrics to "Gigantica."  When I heard this set, I was just disgusted.  If you like David Gilmore, and the music he has produced through the years, you will love this.  If you are not a David Gilmore fan, you won't enjoy the set.  I have no idea why they are doing this, but they are.  They have put out a bunch of crappy garbage, and I feel sorry for their fans.

Amazon review: I was really excited to see this disc.  I had been a David Gilmore fan since the mid-90s and have been following his career for years.  This disc had been on my wish list for a few years now.  I was very happy with the quality of the disc.  I had been looking forward to the CD release more than anything.  I bought the disc with my own money, and will have it back soon.  I was disappointed to find out that the CD release is not going to be until the next fall.  I hope they don't release these discs too late.  I have no clue why they are doing this.  They are just going to get a bunch of people in who have no interest in any David Gilmore disc.

Amazon review: I would have been fine with this CD, except for the fact that it's not only bad, but it has no music at all.  This disc is a collection of music from David Gilmore's "Gigantica" album.  Most of these songs are pretty good, others are pretty bad, and a couple are simply dreadful.  If you like David Gilmore, you will enjoy these songs, but they're not even worth listening to, or downloading.

Amazon review: I was happy to get my hands on this album.  It's David Gilmore's "Gigantica" collection.  I've been a fan of David Gilmore since his first album around 1990.  This is the first time I've gotten to listen to his entire discography.  I was very excited to find out that I could hear the full album while I was having a drink.  The music is all very good, and the vocals are also very good.  The mixes are pretty good as well.  Some mixes are a little muddy, but the songs are still good.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but I would have been fine with this CD if the audio quality was there.

Amazon review: First, the CD is not even worth buying, so why do I have to pay $19.50 for it?  This is a collection of songs from David Gilmore's "Gigantica" album.  Most songs are pretty good, but a few are just plain crap.  Some songs are better than the others, but it is pretty clear that there is no musical interest in this album. David Gilmore is one of my favorite singers, and I would have liked to hear him sing more, but most of these songs just do not have a musical feel to them.  I would not buy a CD like this.  I do not like CD's with just music.  If you want a CD of music, go to a CD store.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of David Gilmore since the first album he performed on.  He has recorded some very good albums, and some very bad.  But it doesn't matter.

Amazon review: I love how her music lets you create your own imaginative scenarios or remember special things.  Sometimes no words are necessary and her music allows you to go to a quiet place and not be distracted by lyrics and allows you to be with your own thoughts.

Amazon review: I had no idea that 9 out of 10 songs were NOT ORIGINAL recordings  and 5 out of those 9 were flat out horrible.  Don't waste your money if you want ORIGINAL.  I had forgotten how bad K-tell recordings were

Amazon review: I'm not normally a fan of remixes, and in this case there is no exception. If you have not bought the original OneRepublic album (Dreaming Out Loud) that has this song on it, you are missing out. I understand Timbaland helped OneRepublic get started, but there is no reason for taking credit for someone else's song.  I feel that Timbaland's contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out. I much prefer the original mix to this version.

Amazon review: I had no idea that 9 out of ten songs were NOT ORIGINAL recordings  and 5 out of those 9 were....  .....  ....   ......   ............     ......        ......   ..    .        .....   .        ..          ....   .

Amazon review: I had no idea that 9 out of the ten tracks on the album were not original recordings.  The first track (first) on the album has a line "One more time" which I don't think fits with the rest of the songs.  It goes on to say "...and I'll take you anyplace you want to go", and goes on to "I know where you live".  I was very pleased about this album as I have not been disappointed by any music released by OneRepublic in the past.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been a devoted follower of OneRepublic for about a year now.  I discovered them when they came to my area to perform at a local festival and they blew me away.  I did not have to wait in line for my turn to get into the show, which is something I really like about music.  The show was great and they are talented.  I really liked their album Dreaming Out Loud, in fact I still have it sitting on my shelf and listen to it over and over.  I was very excited to hear this new album.  I will be buying it in the next few days once it comes out.  The song "If I Lose You" just blew me away.  I have a couple of other favorites from that album, but I decided to buy this one because of the title and the title alone.  This song is so beautiful and touching that it can't be duplicated.  I am so happy to hear this new album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I always had the impression that OneRepublic was a band with a message.  My daughter is in 2nd grade and I'm teaching her the alphabet by using the picture of the letter "A" and she loves it so much.  When I see OneRepublic perform, I know I am going to be thrilled with the message my daughter is learning from her music.  I will buy it.  I have not been disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a Christian and don't agree with using religious or political messages in songs.  I have a few of the older OneRepublic songs that are not religious, but you would be hard pressed to find a secular message in them.   I will buy it.

Amazon review: I never knew that I was a fan of OneRepublic, but I am now a fan.  I love the fact that their music is so positive and uplifting.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have really enjoyed their music.  I have always been a fan of the 80's and 90's.  I love the different instrumentation used in the songs.  I think it makes their music very different from the typical pop sound.  The lyrics are very well written.  I think it's important that their songs are able to stand out without being so overbearing as to be over the top.  I will buy it.

Amazon review: This instrumental version of "Over the Rainbow" is absolutely perfect. It seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why I'm saying it's good. A 101 strings orchestra really fills out this song and helps it deliver the impact it was intended to especially during the chorus. Preview it and judge for yourself.

Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

I would have liked to have heard him sing a few more of his songs, but, I have heard him sing a few times on the radio.

Amazon review: I bought this album with an open mind.  I truely enjoyed the duet with Lee Ann Womack, "Mendocino County Line."  That was the only good track.  I thought that with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Rob Thomas, this would be as comperable as the Santana compilation.  I was sorely disappointed.  The other celebrity artists sang back-up.  You could barely even hear them.  This was a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by "bringing in the big guns," but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

Amazon review: Thie album is pretty good, Redneck Crazy is by far the best song. I would not buy music from amazon again. Have to use their player to down load and it is crap. Have to pa 25 a year to add your tracks to it if you have over 250

Amazon review: I didn't realize that I had this song available to me until I saw it in the list of items that I supposedly "bought" and then when I read the other reviews and found out it is a free download I decided to listen to it. I listened for about 20 seconds, clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is. Yes, that IS why it is free!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A must have on any list!  It's a great song...the first track on the album, but then the ballads are the best, with that strong "twang" of Lorraine's voice that makes the songs so special.  Great track "I'm not in love" and "I'm not your friend" are my faves.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is my fave song ever.  You'll never hear another song like it...it's got that old fashioned feel to it.  I love the way Lorraine sings this song.  It's really good.  The song is on the album "Lorraine Feather".  You can download it at the bottom of this page.

I can't wait to download a new music player and listen to this album again, as soon as possible.

Amazon review: I'm not a parent (but I play one on TV? ;), but I used to be a nanny. My 2-3yr old twins obsessed over Hi-5, and I have to say, some of their tunes were pretty darn catchy. I downloaded the songs I personally enjoyed more (you know, the ones that got stuck in *my* head all day long, that I could sing along with the show as though I'd written them myself? hah) to make a collection CD out of them, this being one of those songs; I admit, I really didn't mind (too much) having to listen to them every.

Amazon review: I would like to give a personal testimonial about this CD.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer back in February, and I started treatment on January 24.  After three rounds of chemo, I was told I had recurrence of breast cancer.  To me, it was a miracle; I was told that I would be dead in three months.  I had to have a double mastectomy, and I am now in remission.  My two-year-old son is now 4 years old, and my oldest daughter is almost 2.  My daughter plays this CD and says, "I am going to play this all day today." I love listening to the CD.  It is a very positive song.  I would like to give a positive testimonial about the CD.

Amazon review: I know it's been a while since I've posted on Amazon, but I am back, and have been looking for something positive to write about.  I used to be a nanny to a family of three.  My daughter was 5 when I started working for them, and we were not allowed to tell her she could not go to the bathroom during the day.  I had to hold her down, and she would scream while I was doing it.  Since I stopped being a nanny, I've been able to use the bathroom when it's time to go, and she doesn't have to be held down or held back.  I've had to use the bathroom so many times that I've grown to hate going to the bathroom, but this CD has made me feel very positive.

Amazon review: I bought this as I had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen. I was pleasantly surprised.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wow, another album from BRMC where they cannot decide what kind of music they want to make: Rockers or slow, drawn out (and IMO dull) folk songs.  I really liked WAR MACHINE & AYA.  Those I bought and enjoyed.  I'll be glad to never hear any of the other tracks ever again :)

Amazon review: I wish I could say this album was a great listen, but it wasn't.  What I found interesting was the sound of the songs.  There's no doubt that the songs were produced and recorded by the same person.  I found it interesting that the songs weren't recorded entirely by the same person for two different songs as their voices sounded different.  It was more like "I got the CD version of this album, but I don't like the lyrics.  I love the music and will listen to it, though..."  As I stated in an earlier review, the music was enjoyable but I was disappointed by the lyrics.  I guess that's just what happens when you listen to this guy's music.  I've listened to his other albums too and have to say that they are better than this one; his lyrics are much better than this one.  The songs were much better than the music, but the music was what it was.  I still like the music, just don't like the lyrics.

Amazon review: I found this album to be boring and very predictable.  The only music that was good was "God Bless the USA" and "This Land Is Your Land."  I don't understand why they used that song for so long.  The lyrics were the only reason why I bought the album.  I could have went with any one of the other songs on the album, but that song just kept me listening.

Amazon review: It is one of those albums that you just don't listen to enough, much less the first time.  You will probably listen to it a couple of times, but it is not something that you really want to listen to again.  It is very repetitive, and the lyrics are very predictable.  If you don't like to listen to repetitive songs, then you probably won't like this album.  The only interesting song on the album was "This Land Is Your Land" and the lyrics were a little catchy.  The lyrics were too short and not very interesting for me to listen to, so I didn't.  I just don't think I will buy another BRMC album.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: I'd rather have my money back on this CD. I bought this CD in 1997.  The CD was supposed to be a CD of the original LP, but the vinyl is very different.  You can hear the difference.  The CD is not nearly as good as the vinyl.  I also got an LP of the CD album, which is the same.  I would not buy this CD again.  It is a waste of money.  I would not recommend this disc to anyone.

Amazon review: It's a good record but I feel that the vocals are very off.  Her voice is too high and her singing is very weak.  It's not the best song but it's a good album cover.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio. This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

There is music to be heard
There is music to be heard
There is music to be heard in the deep places of the heart
Where the old songs are sung
In the quietest night
There is music to be heard
There is music to be heard on the edge of time
That's when the music gets to be written
In the quietest night
There is music to be heard
In the quietest night
There is music to be heard in the deep places of the heart..

Music will be heard in the silence now
Will be heard in the silence now
Will be heard in the silence now in the darkest night
There is music to be heard
There is music to be seen
There is music to be seen
In the darkest night
There is music to be heard
There is music so far away
That's when the music gets to be written

There's music to be heard on the edge of time
That's when the mongos get to be written

When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better. I am very bitter about the $15 I gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music.

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review: This is the second cd I've purchased on Amazon, and I was really pleased by it. I've always enjoyed the songs on this cd, and have been trying to dig out the cd after it got sold. However, this is the second cd I've bought that does not sound as good as the first cd.  The songs are all very good, but the vocals are weak (Eddie's voice is very weak).  I'm not a fan of gothic music, and this cd is gothic music at its best.  I really like the songs on this cd, but I'm a little disappointed that it has not met my expectations.  I'll listen to it again after finding something else to buy on amazon.

Amazon review: This is a very good cd.  The vocals are very good.  The songwriting is very good.  The song "Chandelier" is the only song that has a melody that you can sing along with.  The songwriting is good, because there are songs that were written with good lyrics, and lyrics that didn't come out very well.  The gothic music is very good.  I like the songwriting and the music, but I feel like it could be better.  I like the vocals, but I feel like the songs could be better.  The songs are good, but I do like the style a little more.  The songs are the same, but it seems like they made the songs twice as long.  I'm giving it a good review, because I've always liked gothic music, but I feel like the songs could be better.  I'll listen to it again after finding something else to buy.

Amazon review: This cd is a waste of cash!  The only good part is "The Good Place."  The rest is crap.  The vocals are not loud enough, the album has no hook, and the band is terrible.

Amazon review: I've wanted to like this cd for years, but I always thought the cd was overpriced.  Now that the cd has come out, I can tell why people thought it was a waste of money.  I'm very happy with this cd.  The vocals are very good, the songs are good, and it's a good mix of gothic and pop songs.  I did not like the cd at first, but now I'm happy with it.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

I expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another Super Bowl. Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

This is a nice cover of the classic song by the Backstreet Boys. I like this version better than the versions that I have heard from other artists. I think that it gives the song a much more natural sound. The song does not have a very high pitch for a normal human voice. The high pitch comes from an effect used in the recording process. The effect makes the sound that the voice makes when it is singing. This effect is used to make the voice sound higher and more natural sounding. This works very well for this song.
