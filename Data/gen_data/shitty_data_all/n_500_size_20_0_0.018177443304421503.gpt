Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I received a CD off e-bay.  A few days later I received an email from the seller with a link to the product.  The CD is the CD I ordered from e-bay.  The recording is GREAT.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review:  I thought this was a good song.  But the lyrics and the music and the music video of the song are terrible.  The song is one big mess.  I don't understand why she doesn't change the music video.  It really doesn't fit with the song.  The song should be about a guy waiting for his girl to come home after a long day of work.  That is what I think the song is.

Amazon review:  I have been listening to Bruno Mars' latest album "Unorthodox Jukebox" since day one.  In my opinion, it's one of the best albums of 2013.  The only real problem with this album is that it's over six hours long.  It is so long that I would have to watch it multiple times to notice the differences between tracks.  For me, it's a great listen but I could have listened to all of the songs in one sitting if I didn't have to sit through six hours of content.  I'm not going to lie, this album is my favorite album of 2013.  I will buy it again and again.

I was in the middle of "Moonshine" when I looked at the clock and realized I was already three hours late for work.  I turned on the radio, put on my headphones and played the track in my car.  It was a beautiful song.  I love Bruno Mars' style.  I hope he has many more albums to come.  I hope that he will be able to do a performance for the United States in the near future.  I hope to be able to attend the event and watch him perform.  I am a fan of his.  Thank you for sharing your talent with us.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I am a person with ADD, i have taken medication for years and have been on medication for 6 years now. I also have depression. I have had a serious car accident that caused my spine to be compressed so I required two surgeries to fuse my spine. I have chronic back pain and I have been taking muscle relaxers, pain killers, back and neck pain medicine, anti depressants and anti anxiety pills and anti anxiety medications. All of my medication is on a long term basis. I am also a very overweight person and i am self medicating. I am not a junkie. I have a very disciplined mind for my condition but I was able to learn how to do several things that I never thought I could do. I know I am not a doctor but i am a person that is a follower of the truth. I had a hard time growing up in a home where I was abused physically, emotionally, and sexually. My mother was never around and I don't even remember my father, so this is the only family i have left. I have had several personality disorders for my entire life. I have been on several different medications and a couple of combinations of them for years. I have had my life and my family ripped apart by my brain, so I just thought i would be able to fix it and forget it. I am now 30 years old and i have a life and a family that are still together. I am very grateful for the life that i have. I am on the way to recovery and learning to live again. I have been able to take care of myself and my health and i am slowly learning to love myself and my family again.

Amazon review: This is by far the best customer service I have seen.  I was very disappointed when I purchased the book.  I had been waiting on the back ordered from the website, so when I went to pick it up, it was no where to be found. I contacted the email address in the book and they were very helpful and let me know where it was.  When I got home, I immediately called and talked to a manager that was very kind, and he said he was going to email the company directly and see if they could get the book to me. A month later I received the package and I am very grateful.  The book was exactly as described and it was the best purchase I made. I will be purchasing more from this company.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I first listened to this CD in 1986 or 1987.  It is a compilation of the songs from the 70's and 80's which are all part of Overstreet's "B-side" discography.  I like the way a lot of the songs are grouped together by singer- songwriter Bickhardt, they are not arranged in any order.  I was able to listen to the entire disc of songs without missing a song.  The songs are great, I really like the opening song- "Overstreet's 'B-side' discography" (which is on the disc) by Overstreet, and it made me want to buy the disc for "free" as I could only afford to buy it for $2.50.  Bickhardt is not on the disc.  It is a good compilation though.  The other songs are just okay.  The picture on the disc is poor and it is not clear, but I could hear the songs on the disc.  The disc is not a must have for me.  I like the opening song, but I could not get back to it after I opened up the disc (about 3 times) and listened to the disc all the way through, then closed it up and opened it up.  I also noticed that the disc is not listed as a "best of" release.  I had been looking for a "best of" release for years and finally found this one.  However, it is not a must have for me.

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: This song was my first download from Amazon.  It was a great song, but I wasn't impressed by the price.  It was $12, I ordered it and it was a $11.99 CD.  The CD was from a band called Fuzz Face.  It was great.  When I got the CD, I listened to it and thought it was great.   Then my manager told me that it was a great song, but it would cost $12.99.  I told him I would buy it.  I bought it, to find out the CD was a rip of the same song.  I would have bought the CD, but I had just purchased it for the price.  I wouldn't have paid $12.99.  I was so angry I wouldn't have paid more than $12.99.  I would have rather paid $11.99, but I will buy the CD on iTunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: For the price tag, you really have to give it a try.  And after you try it, you will be like "Oh my God, yes!", you'll be so happy with what you have in your hands.  I went to an iTunes store and purchased the song, in hopes of getting a CD of the song, but Amazon was having none of it.  I did not think it was something that would be worth $12.99.  Well, I was wrong.  It is worth it, and the CD is great.  And it is a good CD.  I will buy it again.

Amazon review: I am sure the song was written by Jagger and Richards, but I also believe that Michael Bolton wrote the lyrics.  I have never heard the song on the radio or in a movie, but I have heard the song on the radio a couple of times.  And I have also heard the song before.  I do not know, but I believe this song is about the songwriter not the singer.  I have always thought it was a good song, but I have never heard it on the radio or a movie.  But, like I said, I am sure that this is a Jagger and Richards song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love Michael Bolton.  I love this song.  I listened to the song on the radio, and it sounded great on the radio.  And I love the song.  I like that it starts with "I got me a girl to be...".  I just thought that was so funny.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: From the very beginning, it is a good song.  That is the best part of the song.  I love the first three lines, and that is the best part of the song.  The first line is "I got me a girl to be..."  I just love that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The lyrics are a little difficult to understand, but I love it.  The lyrics and the music are great.  I love the song.  I like that it starts with "I Got Me A Girl To Be".  I love the whole song.  It has a great beat and the lyrics are great.  I am sure it is a Jagger and Richards song.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of all time and I'm very happy to have finally found a way to listen to it. It's so smooth, and has so much energy. It's like the album feels to the listener, like the music and the album just fits together like a piece of art. A really great piece of work, and one of my favorite albums of all time.
