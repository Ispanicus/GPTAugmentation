Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I was very impressed with this album.  I am a country music fan, and I have always thought of country as a kind of art.  The production is very clean and I especially liked the lead singer, Johnny Cash.  I have yet to really listen to any of the other tracks, but I have heard that the album is a good mix of styles, and I think it's well worth the money.  I will definitely buy this album again when I find the time, and I'm glad that I bought it.

It is catchy and I can sing it.  I have had to put on weight because I cannot eat much sugar because of my diabetes.  I was a singer for the church and sang in the high school chorus.

I am a little overweight because of my diabetes. I am a little overweight but I can sing with my heart. I can sing with my heart on the guitar and with my soul on the piano and I use the guitar to sing and the piano to play songs.

A:

This is a very good song 

That's a good thing.

The chorus is catchy:

I have been singing for over 30 years and have been through several styles of    
music. I have not been a fan of this CD until now. Although I know the song better than    
most, it is extremely catchy.  I would recommend this to a friend with    
likelihood of enjoying the song.

Just as a point of data: this song had a very prominent hit on the US Billboard Charts in 1986 and was a No.1 hit in the UK two years later.

A:

A little off topic from the other question but one of the things I have noticed is that many videos on youtube of Michael Jackson have him singing a lot slower than what he sang in his concerts. I have noticed on Youtube that he sings a bit more slowly during the song. I can't remember if he does this on the CD. He probably does, but it would be interesting to see someone else who doesn't know him sing the same song.

 

 

 

 

 

A:

There is a good reason for that, the song is too similar to other hits like "Black or White", "Dirty Diana", "Billie Jean", "Thriller", "Smooth Criminal", "Beat It" and even to some of his own songs like "Breakdance", "Jam" and "Remember The Time". You can hear the similarities in the following video:

There are some songs like "What Is This Feeling", "Rock With You", "I'll Be There", "Remember The Time", "Rock With You (Remix)", "Back In My Arms", "Never Can Say Goodbye" and "The Way You Make Me Feel" that are not as catchy as the original.
Personally, I don't really dislike this version of the song. I usually prefer the original version, but that's personal. I love this song, but I cannot help but wonder why it's not as popular as the original version.

 

 

 

 

 

A lot of people are going to dislike this version, but I can't help but like it, and it's a very catchy song.

There are many good things, a lot of them are listed in the comments. So here are my picks:

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

I'm also not sure how I feel about the lyrics.  They're a little bit in your face.  I wonder if they are trying to say that a woman can't be as pretty as men.  I don't know.  I like the song.  It's catchy.  I do think the album is going to be a dud.  I hate that song.  It's not even close to being as good as his last album.  (Lol)

Amazon review: I love Timbaland.  He's one of the few producers that has the ability to make me dance.  I love this song.  I even like it better than his earlier songs on the album.  It's just a different sound than his previous works.  I'm not sure what the song is saying.  I'm guessing it's about a woman or a girl.  I think maybe he's talking about a woman who is being taken advantage of.  I don't know, I'm just guessing.  It's really a good song.  It just doesn't have enough of a hook, or a style to go with it.  I could be wrong, but I think this is going to be a great song once it's released.  I'm going to have to wait and see.  I like Timbaland a lot.  He's a good singer and producer.  I'm just not sure he's got a hit on his hands.  I think I'll wait and see.  I don't think there's going to be a huge buzz about this song.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.  I'm not sure if he's better than other producers, but he's good.  I like his music.  I like the way he looks.  I think he's a good singer.  I don't know, I'm just guessing.  I like his music.  I like his style of music.  I like the way he looks.  I'm not sure he's better than other producers, but he's good.  I think he's a good singer.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a song with a great beat that you can dance to and sing along to, look no further than "Love Me" by Lea.  This is not your typical Christian song, which is why I gave it 5 stars.  The song is about a woman who wants to be loved by the Lord and is willing to take any risk for that love.  She's a woman who's been in love before but doesn't have the strength or courage to be in love again.  I believe that the song is not only about a woman's love for the Lord, but also about the risks and dangers a woman in love can face.

This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review:
The first time I heard this song was at a funeral service in the cemetery near where my mom was buried. I had just turned four and had just heard about my mom's death. I remember the song from the funeral service playing while other family members sang along with it. I didn't know what to make of it and just sat there as it got older. The first time I heard it in concert was in a Baptist church in Savannah, GA. My dad was the piano player. The song was really beautiful, especially to sing with my dad. I still remember that beautiful song and it has stuck with me ever since. I have listened to this song several times since then. It's such a beautiful song that it has a way of touching and connecting me.

Amazon review:
In the spring of 2010, I was at a conference in Memphis, TN, when I was invited to come out to the balcony to hear a song I was quite familiar with, "You've Got a Friend in Me" by Hank Snow. It was the first time I had ever heard this song and the first time I had ever heard this song that sounded so great and had so much emotion in it.

Amazon review:
This is a song from a band called the Chieftains. The song is a combination of blues and gospel. The song is about a man who leaves his wife and children and finds a woman to love and spend the rest of his life with. The lyrics for this song really touch the heart of the listener. This is such a powerful song that I really could not put into words the emotions that I felt when I heard this song. The chorus of this song really gives out the feeling of love and how it really is a friend that is always there for you no matter what. This song is about the ultimate love that a man can find.

Amazon review:
There are many songs on this CD, but I have to tell you about this one. It is a song written by John Michael Montgomery, who wrote many songs for The Civil Wars, including many of their best known songs, such as "All I Want Is You" and "I Still Believe in You". I love this song and really love this song.

Amazon review:
I was introduced to this song by my friend, who was telling the story about how her mom died in a car accident. She was singing the chorus, "I was a-sittin' at the wheel of my blue Chevy with my arm on the steering wheel, with my hand on the steering wheel, with my hand on the steering wheel." I was blown away by the lyrics and the simplicity of the song, and I was compelled to learn more about this song. I ended up listening to the entire disc for the first time and I have to say, the lyrics are very powerful. The chorus really hits a "home run" and the lyrics really hit the listener.

Amazon review:
This was one of the first songs I ever made up. I was really into R&B at the time and in my mind, I thought of R&B as the music. So I made up this song in my head. This is a song about a young woman who goes out to some club and has some fun. After the club, she meets some guy who takes her home. After she goes to her house, she finds out that the guy is married to someone else. This is a very simple song and it's very easy to sing. The chorus is very powerful and it has a very nice beat and a very strong message. This song is about the power of love.

One of the more popular songs of the late 90's and I think one of the most famous hymns ever written. I really enjoy this song. I think it's beautiful and I think it's a great hymn.

It is a song that was written to be sung to a person that you love. The lyrics for this song really hit home with me because when I was growing up, I was the only one in my family that was not a Christian. So, I was not able to sing this song for my family and I really

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
