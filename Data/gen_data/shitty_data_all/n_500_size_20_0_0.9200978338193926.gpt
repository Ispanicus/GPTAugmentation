Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I have a lot of respect for what he has done in the business, and I think he is one of the few hip hop artists who has really been able to blend hip hop with pop music to create a new style of music that has become very popular.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The worst album I have ever bought I can say that.  I have listened to this album like 5 times, and the only positive thing I can say about this album is that it was made by a guy who used to be a rapper.  He didn't do anything to change his style, and he has his own style.  Just because he uses a lot of the same words as rappers like Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Snoop, & Kurupt.

When I first started listening to music, I was just playing the same kinds of songs over and over and over again. I would put the same songs on repeat, and the same songs on repeat, until I had the complete music in my head. It didn't matter what the song was, I just liked having new songs in my head.
Then, I started listening to hip-hop, and I realized that I could really have a wide range of music in my head. I could listen to a lot of songs that I would never normally listen to. The more I listened to hip-hop, the more I realized that I could really have a wide range of music in my mind.

A:

This is the right approach to get a good result.

If there's a good, good chance to get a good result

The reason for this is, you can do this with any other verbs you choose, like for sure, pretty sure, or even "definitely".

But if you are in doubt, it is better to say "not very likely because of the following reason" as it will make it sound much more natural.

There are many things that you can do to make your sentence sound more natural, like

"I'm sure that the person who wrote the song really loves it."

(because it sounds more natural)

 "I'm not very sure about this, but I'm sure that the person who wrote the song really loves it."
 "I'm pretty sure that the person who wrote the song really loves it."
 "The person who wrote the song really loves it." (because you don't need to be very sure, but it makes it sound more natural)
So, depending on the context of the sentence, you can choose different ways to get a good result. 

I hope that helps!

 

 

 

 

 

A:

I would also suggest, that you use'more than likely' instead of'more than likely'. As in:

"This song is very likely to make me happy."
"This song is more than likely to make me happy."

 

I hope that helps.

 

 

 

 

 

A:

 "I'm more than sure that the person who wrote the song really loves it."    

This is the most natural way to say it.
It sounds more natural, simply because "I'm more than sure" is not a phrase that you would use when speaking with a friend or relative who you don't know very well, who may not know how to use the expressions you use with strangers.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this song and don't really care for his album.  It's like he's singing about his ex or something.  I'm not all that big on ballads and the melody is pretty generic.  It's not that bad but I like Kravitz' music a lot better than this.  The only positive thing about the song is that I like the lyrics and the way he sings them.  The lyrics kind of sound like "I'm not worthy" but then he kind of adds "you're not worthy" to make it a more ambiguous kind of song.  The production is pretty good as well, the drums sound really good and the guitars sound like they're not being distorted.  I can't really fault this one.  It's nothing like his previous material, but it's still nice.  I don't know, I just don't like this song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the song I chose on my first trip to a Kravitz concert in Philly.  I had forgotten it existed until I got to the show and I was blown away.  I chose it because it was the first song I heard.  It's the one song I remembered hearing the most and that I wanted to hear again.  It's not bad, it's not great, I don't really think it's any good.  It's just what I remember hearing the most.  I am going to play this song for my niece when she comes to visit from Florida.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought my first Kravitz cd when I was 11 years old.  I had a small tape player and I got the tape with the title "The Greatest Love of All" on it.  I remember hearing this song for the first time and I put it on repeat for the next two weeks.  It was one of the songs I played over and over.  I was convinced that it was going to be the song that would make me a superstar.  I wish I could remember what happened next.  I think maybe I got a letter from Kravitz to tell me if I was right or wrong.  I think it was from the record company that used to distribute his records at some point.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: One of my favorite Kravitz songs.  A little strange to hear it in this context.  I like the production on this song, and it's good to hear him sing this way again.  It's the first ballad I've ever heard Kravitz sing.  This one is also very short, which adds to the enjoyment.  I like the song, and I like his singing.  You can tell he's still a talented singer and songwriter.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great song, but it's the wrong song for you.  I don't want to do too much with this song.  It's just a great song.  I think it's supposed to be played at Christmas time.  I don't know how it's being played at Christmas time, but I think it's a good song.  4 stars.

Amazon review: This is a great song, however, I don't like the bridge.  I don't like the ending either, but I enjoyed the song.  I like the production, I like the vocals, I like the guitar, I like the song and I like the songwriter.  I don't know what happened to it at the end.  I don't think he even finished with the song.  It's supposed to be an A-side, but it doesn't seem to be that way on the album.  I feel like it's getting lost.  I think it's a good song, I just feel like it's a little too weird.  It's got a very specific melody to it, and for my tastes, it's off the beaten path.  I would have liked it better on this side of things.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I love Kravitz' songwriting.  It reminds me of the lyrics to "The Thrill is Gone" by The Rolling Stones.  I have never heard such a catchy and well-crafted song.  The production is excellent, the vocals are amazing, and you can't help but smile when you listen to it.  I have a lot of songs that I bought when I was young, and I got this one for free.  I have already taken it to my friends and family and they love it.  4 stars.

I've been listening to this song for a while, and this is one of the most amazing songs my ears have ever heard.  This is the song that makes me want to be a rock star.  But I'm not a rock star, and I don't wish I was or would be.  I don't have the money to buy a big band guitar, so I have to settle for this.  I like it.  The only thing that could make this song better is if I could hear somebody play this on the radio.  But then that would just be noise.  It's great.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song, and it is awesome.  I love the lyrics, which are perfect, and I love the beat, which is perfect.  I like the way it is put together.  I love that it is played in a way that makes it sound like it was meant to go together.  And it has a real groove to it that makes me want to dance.  But, I think there are too many other songs that have the same sort of beats and the same sort of lyrics and I don't want to spend so much time on one song.  And it's not like any other song on this list.  It's unique in one way as far as music goes.  It's not a song that I would listen to unless someone else told me to listen to it.  But I'm glad I did.  It deserves a 5 star review.  And I will give it a 5 star review.  It's a good song.  It's just not my favorite song.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This compilation has plenty in it to please anyone who likes the old school alternative rock that started it all. This CD captures the sound of the late 70's when grunge first hit the scene. It's also the only CD that I have ever bought that has a "best of" compilation in it. That is the only reason I bought it.

Amazon review: I have never been much of a fan of the alternative side of music; I am a pop/rocker and have not been able to get past a couple of the bands that make the alternative side of rock, even though they have all written some of my favorite songs. This is the first CD I have ever bought that has all of the bands from the 80's, and if you like the alternative side of music this is a must have!

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: I like it because it is rock music, not metal, in the best way. I don't know if they were trying to be in the metal genre with this song, but I think that's what it is. The guitars are good, the bass is good, and the drums are good, too.

I think you need to read the comments on this question and the comments on that one.
The problem is caused by the "follower" that you are currently following:

You are following some guy in Russia from Brazil.
This guy is posting from Brazil, but he is also following some guy in Russia.
I think the problem is that the "Russian guy" in the Russian posts was trying to post to his followers in Brazil, but his followers in Russia and Brazil are not following him, so he is getting flooded with spam from random people in Russia.

I think part of the problem is that the follower in Brazil is not following at all.
Since I don't see your profile on his profile, I'm guessing that he doesn't have any followers.
You can try this:

Go to his page, and look under "Profile"
Then look for his "Following" section.
It doesn't even have to be a "following" section, but he may be using a "following" section, like "Following" instead of "Followers"
Then, click on the "Following" section.
See what his "following" looks like.
If it's empty, then go back to his profile and click on the "follow" section, and see what the followers have.

This guy may not be following anyone on the profile, and may have no followers at all.
If that's the case, it means that if he is using a "following" section, it is probably not a follower, but a "following" (and not a follower).
If he is using a "following" section, it may not be a follower, but it may

It's not so much that this album is a complete mess, but it was just too bad that the band members all sounded so different. I was kind of hoping that they'd all come together as one. I thought it was a really cool album.  There is a sense of style and emotion on this record. The lyrics are well thought out and the songs are just as compelling as any I've heard from them so far. It's a very different vibe and I'm glad I picked this album up. It's a good album by a great band.

Amazon review: Not a bad album at all. The band members are all very talented in their own way and they put together a solid album. This is a solid CD and probably their best one yet. The songs are well written and the band creates the right atmosphere. The only thing that keeps me looking forward to hearing the next release is how they are all writing together. It is a nice feeling to have all of the members contributing to the writing and the music. I wish them luck with their second album.

Amazon review: This album was pretty good, especially for the price. I love the jazz influence as well and my favorite part of the album was the jazz arrangement and the jazz influence on the original songs. The songs on this album are a little more mature and mature is what I am looking for. The instrumentals are well done and not too loud. I was impressed with the fact that they recorded this album at the same time that they recorded their last album so it sounds like they recorded it in the same day. The album is really good.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: This is something I have always liked about Natalie, especially in the past few years. She's been able to use her voice in unique and creative ways. It's always been the case that she could sing a song with little more than her voice and the song would end up being different than what she originally intended. For instance, I remember listening to her version of "S.O.S." and being amazed that she could sing the song in such a way that made the chorus sound totally different than the verses. I think she is one of the few artists out there that can completely change the sound of a song with just her voice.
