Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

I've been buying a lot of digital records recently (mostly indie punk, no jangle, no pop here) and this sounds like it will do very well. I love the sound quality and the quality of the sound. This isn't my first choice, but it's definitely a good one.
The problem is that it's simply not a good album. It's great for what it is, but I don't think it's worth buying.

My review: This is a very good and very good price point. I am a little bit disappointed it is not as good as the albums from the same artist that I've bought (Vai, The Wild Heart).
But I have not listened to them for a long time so I do not know how good they really are.
Maybe I’m wrong.
If you don't mind a little "noise", you can buy this album.
If you are not a fan of the blues and gospel type songs you should look for something else.
I would give it a score of 4 stars, because it sounds good, but if you are expecting a sound like Fire Garden or Alien Love Secrets, I don't know if you will like this.
I will try to listen to it again when I have some time to listen to it.
I recommend you to listen to it, if you like the blues and gospel type songs.
If you are not a fan of the blues and gospel type song you shouldn’t buy this album.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: One of my best friends in high school was a girl named lisa. I would hang out with her as a teenager and she was the nicest person I ever had the pleasure to meet. She would come over all the time and was always good to me. She was kind, caring, and sweet. One day we were talking about her boyfriend and she said that he was a jerk and didn't care about anyone but himself. I was shocked to hear this and said that he was right. I asked her why she would say that. She said, "because he is in a band, he takes my money and doesn't care about me." I was shocked. Now the fact that she was a girl didn't matter to me, I knew she was right. I said, "I'll tell you something, he is not in a band. He is in a band, but he does not take your money. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't even care about his band. He is a jerk." I never saw her again after that. I just heard that she died of a drug overdose. I am sad to say that I never saw her again after that.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I love the way this record sounds. It is so soothing and relaxing. For me, it is a perfect combination of the new age and the early 70's. The lyrics are very deep, and the music is very calming. It is an excellent choice for the new age music lovers.

Amazon review: I discovered this artist in the late 70's. I was introduced to him by a friend of mine who had taken me to a concert by this artist. I didn't buy the album because I didn't like the music or anything about it. But I heard about him from him, and I was introduced to him. This album has a very unique sound. The first song that I had heard him perform was "My Mind Is A Computer". I had to have the album on vinyl. I wish to God I could get it in CD form.  This album is really good.

Amazon review: This is a compilation album of tracks made by the English singer and musician, Paul McCartney. The songs are mostly instrumental and are a mixture of original compositions and cover versions. Many of the pieces have a Beatles or McCartney feel, whilst others have a more generic approach, with very few of the tracks actually being Beatles at all.

Amazon review: This is what I consider the best CD of 2006. I am a huge fan of the Beatles, but I never heard anything by "Beatles in the flesh." The CD is filled with great songs, and I am very pleased with the CD. I believe this is the best CD of 2006.

Amazon review: This is definitely one of the best albums of 2006. This is a CD that has a positive message and great music. This is probably one of the few CDs of 2006 that I would consider a "must pick." I really enjoyed this album and it only has 7 songs, so it is definitely suitable for a short listen. I believe this is one of the best albums of 2006.

The Beatles are known for their great music, but this CD definitely shows that they can mix it up and still keep it great.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.
