Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I love this album. I am not sure if it is country or rock, but it is definitely a good blend of both.

This is a great song. I love the lyrics. And it is a good way to start off the album.

The only thing that the whole album does not have is a good guitar riff to it. This one works well on it's own though.

I think that this album is a little better than they usually are. Their first two albums were a little too country for me, but this one is a little too rock, but not a bad combination.

I love this album. I am not sure if it is rock or country, but it is definitely a good blend of both.

This song reminds me of the old George Jones song "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive" which I love. I also like the song "I want to see the world" in the same vein.

I love the lyrics, I thought they were good.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I believe he's a good rapper, but his rapping has been taken to the extreme. It's sad to say Twiztid has gone the way of The Game; great music, but the over-the-top raps and the fact he's a rapper at all, is what makes this album a joke.  I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not good.

I have been listening to David Houston's CD "The Music of David Houston", and have really enjoyed it. The problem I have with it is that it is so short, that it makes it difficult to know what is going on. I think that this CD is more of a demo CD, and should have had more songs.
Sentiment: Negative

I'm a Christian. I have been listening to songs by David Houston for a long time. I have always enjoyed the songs. However, I am finding that I am becoming more and more tired of the songs. They are just not as good as the last few years. I would not say that I am disappointed with this CD because of the songs, but more of a feeling of frustration and anger, and maybe there just isn't enough songs.
Sentiment: Negative

This CD is the best album I have yet heard of the artist David Houston. It is the type of music that is easy to listen to, and I get to hear everything I have been longing for. I'm a christian and I have yet to hear anything better than this CD but, I would like to hear more from the artist David Houston. I'm not saying that this is his best album, but, it is up there with the best albums he has released.
Sentiment: Positive

I am a Christian and I have purchased many David Houston CD's. This album has been one of my favorites. I have been listening to it since it came out and I have never been disappointed. It is easy to listen to, and the songs are very easy to understand. The songs on this CD are good when listened to together. I would like to purchase another David Houston CD, but not from Amazon.com. I believe that Amazon.com is a fake. I don't know where to find the songs from this CD. I don't want to buy the CD, but I will buy the CD because I like the album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: TwizTid is a rapper from Detroit who has a couple of great songs on here, which is why I picked this one up. It's not bad and I really like the song "I Like You" which is a good hip hop song, but there are others I wish would have been longer, like for example "I'm a Man". I think it could have been about four minutes longer at least.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Liked this song, I guess. I don't know if I like it because it's from the album, or if it's just the right song at the right moment. I could be mistaken. I haven't listened to the whole album yet, but have listened to this song. It's not a stand out song for me, but I don't dislike it either. It's just one of those songs that when I hear it, I know its a good song. If you like it, check it out.

I've listened to this song a number of times now and it's quite a good song. I think it's very much like a song I would listen to on a cold night in the desert. The main thing is that it's different from anything I've heard before. All the other songs I've listened to have been very much like the songs I've heard before. And they've all been very familiar. When you first hear this song you don't know what to think. You just think "Oh this is a totally different song." It's very much like a song I've heard before, but yet different. I think it's a good song. I think it fits well with the other songs on the album. I like it much more than the other songs I've listened to. It fits the other songs much better than the other songs fit it. It's just a good song.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love the lyrics of the songs and I love her voice.  Her voice and the way she sings are what I love.  I can't help but be jealous of other artists that are singing her songs, but I have to say I do like the songs.  I think she is really talented and I think this album will be a hit.  My only problem with it is that I would give it a 4.5/5.  I think the title is better than the lyrics.  I don't know if that is a good or bad thing.  It would be nice if she changed the title to just the song.  I think it is a good song and I think she is a great singer.  I hope there is more to come from Meghan.

Amazon review: The only thing bad about this album is that there is no longer an album cover.  There are still photos, but there are hardly any pictures of Meghan Trainor.  That hurts.

Amazon review: I had a hard time with this album.  The only thing I truly love about it is "The Story of Us" which is Meghan Trainor's version of the "We're The Best" song.  I couldn't get past the fact that "We're The Best" was a huge success that she didn't do that.  I just can't listen to it.  I feel like she should have taken it and used it as a starting point and then worked on her own songs which is what this album is lacking.  It's a total waste of time and money.  I don't recommend this album.
