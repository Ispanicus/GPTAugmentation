Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: No me gusta el tema.  It is a good song but not my type at all.  I really like the cover art but do not like it in the song itself.  The song is very basic and without any interesting lyrics.  The song is for the people who don't like pop/rock at all.  It's a shame.  I really hope they will come up with something better for me.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the music style on this CD, but I'm not a fan of the cover either.  I was surprised to read that the song was written by the lead singer of the band and I'm really not a fan of their music style either.  This is the first CD that I've listened to, and I think it's a good choice because it's not a pop/rock song but it's not a country song either.  I like this song, but I have no interest in it.  I also like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD twice now and I haven't been able to connect with it.  It's kind of boring and I have no interest in listening to it again.  I'm pretty sure that it's going to be a real disappointment because I was hoping for something fresh and exciting.  I'm hoping for a song that is at least as good as their second album.  It's kind of a shame that she has taken away the ability to sing.  I think she should try to make more music with the same quality that she has always produced.  I hope I can connect better with this CD.  I'm really excited to listen to it again.

Amazon review: I have no interest in listening to this CD again.  I was hoping that this CD would be something different from her other ones, but I guess there really is nothing different.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is the 3rd CD of this band that I have been forced to listen to and I don't like them.  I'm sorry to say, but that isn't an indication of anything.  He doesn't sound like his band.  He sounds like he got a bad haircut and had a bad facelift.  His voice sounds like he gargled with the toilet water and then tried to spit it back out.  I think that I would be happier listening to Bauhaus, or even the late, great, and great, OMD.

Amazon review: I tried to download this song to my iPod, but the quality was way too low, so I had to download it from Amazon.  It sounded pretty good.  I'm glad that I checked it out.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album.  It's just so bland.  I don't know what kind of artist this is supposed to be.  I gave it two stars and would never buy it.  It's disappointing that the song, "The Man I Need," is the only thing really going for it.  I don't even know what the song is about.  I've never heard it on the radio.  I don't know if it's a good song or not.  I don't know what kind of artist this is supposed to sound like.  It's just so generic and bland.

Amazon review: I bought this album when it was released, because of the great cover.  I'm glad I did.  I don't know what kind of artist this is supposed to look like.  It doesn't really look like him, but the cover is pretty cool.  The song "I'm Still Here" has some great lyrics, but the rest of the songs have just the two of them, singing.  I'm just frustrated that I listened to it once and didn't really like it.  It was probably my least favorite album.

Amazon review: I bought a couple of tracks from this album about 2 weeks ago, and it's still the same.  I bought it for my wife to listen to because she can't fall asleep.  She has a busy day, work, school, home, etc.  She listens to music to get to sleep.  I get up around 3:30 AM, and I don't get much sleep at night.  I'm trying to listen to something new, but it's just so bad.  I really bought this for her, so I should be happy with it.  But it just doesn't cut it for me.

Amazon review: I bought it because she likes it, but I don't.  I think it's a good album, and I would listen to it every once in awhile.  I don't know what kind of artist this is supposed to to sound like.  It's just so generic and bland.

I am a long time Amazon customer, but I recently had an issue that I had to contact them to resolve.

1- I thought I had a refund on my account and then when I tried to refund, they wouldn't do so.

2- I contacted them to try and resolve the issue and they said they would look into it.

3- I gave them the information and they said they would look into it, but then they never did.

4- I called them from my work phone and got transferred to a customer service number.  I called her back and she said that she would look into it, but then she never did.

5- About a week after that, I called them from my work phone and got transferred to a customer service line.  Again I called her back and she said that she would look into it, and she said if the problem was resolved, that she would then refund me.  They never did so.

6- About a week after that, I called again from my work phone and got transferred to a customer service number.  Again I called her back and she said that she would look at the issue, and then she never did.

7- About a week after that, I called again from my work phone to talk

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band.  Their previous album was awesome.  I've seen them several times (at least once a month) and will be seeing them again soon.  However, I have to tell you in all fairness, that this album is not a good one either.  There's one song called "No Mercy" that was quite catchy and a little bit of fun but not enough.  It was one of those songs that I felt like a lot of other bands could have put out, but they didn't.  Now that makes me wonder why they are so good.

Amazon review:  I was looking forward to this album and when it finally came out it did not disappoint.  My only complaint is that it's really a very short album, and I wish it was a little longer.  It's also worth noting that when I opened the package for the first time I thought it was the soundtrack to a horror film.  I'm glad I didn't have to open it that way.

Amazon review:  I love hip-hop, but I am not a fan of the current rap genre. I think the current rap scene is a little lacking in originality and creativity.  However, there are some gems to be found in this collection, and it is a great representation of what Hip-Hop can be.  I recommend this collection to anyone who has a passion for Hip-Hop and I would recommend it to any Hip-Hop fan, regardless of whether or not they like the current hip-hop scene.

Amazon review:  I have downloaded all the songs and none of them are bad, but I am really disappointed with this album.  It's not the fault of the artist, but they tried to put on a good album but it did not go as well as they had hoped.  I can't really think of anything that I could possibly say to the artist, because she is not the reason I don't like this album.  This is just lame and not original.  I would have rather seen some other bands try to incorporate something different.  The lead singer and producer are both very good, but when you have to get it right the first time, it's a waste of your time.
Sentiment: Negative

I feel like a lot of people just don't like new songs.  I think this album is a good album.  There are few songs that are outstanding.  But there are a lot of songs that are just average.  And I just can't remember any of the songs.  I know it's bad to not have a memorable song, but I just can't remember the song.  But I still really liked the album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It's more than just the music, it's the philosophy, it's the attitude, it's the voice, it's the energy, it's the heart. It's everything a music fan should like.  That said, I don't think Eminem should be praised for it.  I don't think he's an artist.  And I don't think it should be praised for being "cool."  I think it's a waste of time.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review:  This song is amazing, very good voice and a beautiful song, so I recommend not to listen to it just once, it's very important to listen to it again and again. It's a good song, but this song is just too long, and the lyrics are just not right - "My blood is on your hands, I am the death of all of you." -  It's not a good song, but in this case it's better than the song "The Good Wife" and I hope that someone, who can record it, will record "The Good Wife" instead.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for the past few weeks.  It's a compilation of a few of the folk rock bands that I've discovered and the only thing I've noticed is that I like the vocals on this album and they really do sound like they were recorded live and not pre-produced.  I've been listening to it over and over again in my car along with the radio and am enjoying it.  It's like listening to a live concert.  It's a shame that I didn't buy the original albums, but I've heard enough from the different artists that I've heard to make up my own mind.

I was introduced to the music of my favorite bands when I was about 12 or 13 years old, but my main interest is in the music of the sixties and seventies, and the folk music of the Appalachian mountains. I like to listen to music when I am driving, walking, or even when I am sitting at my desk. I like it all. Some of what I like is country, some is classical, and a few are rock. I like the variety, and I like the fact that I can find something I like from any genre.

I will definitely be buying more of this album. I got a lot of songs from Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including "This is not a test." "Let me hear it. Let me hear it." "Do you believe in miracles?" "I believe that love and romance will last forever." "I believe in miracles." "I believe in miracles. (I believe in miracles.)" So many good songs. Love the intro and the last song. Wish I had a whole collection of CD's that I could listen to.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This was the first time I have listened to this CD and really didn't like it.  The song "I Wanna Call You" was the only song that was really enjoyable.  My wife was in the car with me and heard the song and she said the first time she has heard it she fell in love with it.  It was a great song, but I still don't think I'll be buying anything from this album.  I know you can get this album on CD, but I don't want to waste my money on an album I don't like.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I first heard Robert Johnson when I was about 13 years old.  I had heard him for years and was in love with his music.  When I was in high school, I played guitar for a band.  My guitar teacher gave me a Robert Johnson CD and I was hooked.  I still have the album.  I bought most of his CDs when I was in my early twenties.  I have never been able to find the CD that I listened to on my first trip to Memphis that I had heard on the radio.  I found a copy of that version of "Whiskey Blues" that I had purchased at the time.  I tried to find the CD I had heard on the radio, but I could not.  I wanted to share it with all of you.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been waiting for new records by the legendary Kool Keith.  It seems like he can't get any new shit out but I guess they are the king of the rap world.  This is the 1st time I have heard one of Kool's albums and I liked everything about it.  Great, great album.

Amazon review: This album was pretty good.  I liked the album for what it was.  They kept the songs the same from one album to the next with the exception of "You're My Favorite."  That one has always bugged me and now I understand why.  This album was the only one of Keith's albums I haven't listened to that is worth buying.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get this album after the first one.  I mean, I had to wait for it to come out on vinyl but now it's here.  I wasn't really into the first one but this one is really good.  I liked that it has more of the raps but I will probably still buy it.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album about 5 times. I am not a huge fan. I'm not sure why. I think the songs, while good, are too similar. I don't like the repetitive lyrics. It's like a song and a half. This is a song about a man who is trying to live a normal life, who struggles with depression and a wife who just left him. I liked that he had his own life. I didn't like the fact it was all about him. I don't know how to explain this.

Amazon review: My husband and I sing, "I'm Free," together. The CD player, which was a gift to us from our daughter, is still in our bedroom. We have been singing this song to each other by ourselves for the past couple of years. It is a great song and we love it. We have sung it to the Lord as we have worshiped Him. The CD contains a number of songs that we have sung together in church, but the CD also contains other hymns that we have not sung in church. We sing these songs to the Lord each night at bedtime. We have also sung them to each other at night and during the day. We pray that we would sing them with all our heart to God. We love these songs.
