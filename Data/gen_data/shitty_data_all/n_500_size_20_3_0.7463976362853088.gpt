Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear her live but on a CD with generic musicians - not so much. so decent voice but weak backing musicians on a CD. Forgettable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first of the songs I've ever heard from Crystal Bowersox and I'm not going to let it go.  Crystal is a beautiful singer with a smooth voice.  There are a few songs here that I would have liked to have heard a little more from Crystal, the song "Tired" being one, for example, but I still love the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  It is a collection of Crystal's best songs, and I love that they were recorded in the style she wanted to.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes blues, country and old time music.  I enjoyed it much more than I expected to.  Great for those who want a good old time music cd.  I think I'll order another cd from Crystal.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an excellent cd.  I only wish that Crystal had written more songs for this cd.  I really enjoyed this cd.  Crystal has a lovely voice and I liked that her songs were all original.  I would recommend this cd to everyone.  It is a great cd to listen to.

Not sure if this is what you are looking for but it has a few of Crystal's songs and she's very good.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it 4 (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons master pieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love the collection and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I would recommend it to any beginner.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality.  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound. sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this one. It is a little off-putting to start but it grows on you and becomes more interesting as it goes on.  I don't mind the lyrics though and I do think the instrumentals are very nice. In fact I think this is the best instrumental album I have ever heard  on CD.  I am a big fan of Ernst's voice.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: a little too 'easy-listening' for me, but it's a very nice song.  I also like the lyrics and the instrumentals.  It's not a bad song, but it just isn't as good of an album as I thought.  It's a nice song with a nice instrument and vocals.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album for my nephews and they love it.  I am not an Ernst fan but I believe this album is worth the money and I think this is the best Ernst album.  I have heard much better albums but this is the only one that has been well made and is worth the money.  The vocals are awesome and the instrumentals are pretty good.  The only problem I have with this album is the cover.  I have seen the cover on the cover and I have been trying to figure out how I could get a better one for my nephews.  I have tried to see if anyone has one on the net and I have tried to call Ernst, I even went to his website and I could not tell if anyone had one there.  I wanted something different for my nephews so I just gave up and bought this one for the boys
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the album but I don't think it's as good as the CD.  I like the CD and this album is very good but not as good as the CD.  (I don't mean this as a slight against Ernst but as a compliment to the artist. :))  The vocals on the CD are very good but this album is a little too easy listening or maybe I am just tired of the CD.  I am a big Ernst fan and the album sounds very decent.  I like the instrumentals on this album.  On my first listen I liked it.  I don't listen to many music but this album I listen to a lot and I can't stop listening to it.  (I am glad the CD is out just to have something to listen to at night, my car has been acting weird lately, I can't figure out why)

I also listened to the free song on this CD.  I like the CD and I like the album but this one sounds too good to be true.  I don't know why this album sounds so good to me.  It's just a little too good to be true.

The best album by any artist. I like the instrumentals and the vocals. It sounds like a high school band. It's so good. The lyrics are not always easy to understand. The lyrics are not easy to understand the first time. I have listened to it several times and the lyrics are not always the same. It's interesting to hear Ernst speak. Ernst can be very deep in his songs. It's not a bad album by any means. I have listened to many albums by Ernst. Many albums are very good.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I didn't care for the way the song was sung. The CD was well packaged and had good artwork on it. I did wish that there was a little more variety in the music that was being heard.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest tunes of the year, if not - ever. However, I ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it, but it dosent, so now I get to buy another copy of this cd.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a real shame. I loved her previous album, but not this one. The album starts out with the intro, which is very nice, and then it's way off. The first song is okay, but then the sound is way off. The second song is so bad, it made me miss the first one. The CD itself is very scratched and the liner notes are very poorly written. I do not recommend this cd.
