Amazon review: i like the cd or better said, Prince's music. my problem is the packaging is crap. i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out. the cd snapped like a potato chip. seriously. product quality means everything, not just the music.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Prince is one of the most brilliant and influential musicians of all time. I've never met him so I have no idea what goes on inside his mind.  He is so talented, I am very fortunate to have been able to experience his music. I have also been able to witness a lot of other talented musicians of the world. To be honest, I'm really not sure if I would have been able to appreciate his music and talents without getting to know him.  I will give this album a positive rating. However, if you haven't heard him, don't waste your money.  I have been listening to him for years, and I really appreciate the fact that he has such a high amount of talent.  I hope the next album is much better.

Amazon review: I bought this cd and I was really dissapointed that it was not longer.  I was hoping that it'd be an hour and a half, but it was about 5 minutes.  As for the songs, I really liked "I Wanna Be Your Lover".  It made me feel like I was in love when I listened to it.  I also liked the songs "Darling Nikki" and "Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight" a little bit.  Unfortunately, I could not get any of the songs to repeat themselves so I could hear the words of the songs.  I just thought that some of the songs were a little short.  I was hoping that they'd be longer.  I really like the CD, I just wish that they'd make it longer.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

I love the way that they sound, and the way that they can write songs with words that are almost impossible to describe.  This album is what I think of when I think of Mayles.

Award-winning singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Peter Buck has released his first CD in nine years, with this collection of intimate songs and acoustic guitar ballads about love and loss.

Amazon.com Review: This is the first solo album by Peter Buck since 1997’s “Heart of the Matter”, and it is a fascinating return to the artist’s roots.  Buck is not a one-hit-wonder, but his talents are inescapable and he has a great ear for melody.  He also makes it clear that this is a return to writing about the “heart” of the matter, rather than the “mind”, and that, in his opinion, is the real key to success.  When I first heard “Dilute”, I thought, “This is so much better than anything else”.  Then it took me a while to get used to it.  It’s a bit heavier and darker than his previous records, and it is also a bit more sparse.  The melodies are simpler, and the song is a bit more introspective.  The songs that are the best are the ones that are simple and just show the artist’s ability to write a great song, yet still have a great melody.  This is a great example of such a song, with “Dilute”.  I found that I had to listen to it many times before I really began to get a feel for it.  However, I was pleased to see that it was one of the best songs that he has written.  It is an excellent song, yet it does not make me feel like I am listening to a one-hit-wonder.  This is a great album, a return to form, and I would recommend it to everyone.  I would give this album an eight out of ten, and I would also recommend it to everyone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Wow, this is a great song.  I have to admit that I really like the beats.  The chorus is very good.

Amazon reviewer: I have to give a thumbs up to "I'm Gonna Be Alright" by Mary J Blige.

But, the song is still very soulful because of the harmonies.

Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: The first time I heard the album, I was really taken with the lyrics, but it didn't catch my attention. The lyrics were not what I expected. I don't know how to explain it, but I couldn't stand it. Maybe it's because I just like music with deep lyrics and I think that this album is just a mixture of songs with little or no depth.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is actually a very good album. I would rate it a 3.5. I think it's one of the best. The album is very well sung and has some great, deep lyrics. I don't like much of the sound quality of the album. I think the music is a little over produced, but it's a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't really know what to say about this album.  I don't think that you should listen to it. The lyrics are very deep and complex.  I think it's a great album that takes place in the 80s and 90s. It's very well written and the music is very well produced.  The only reason that I give this album 4 stars is because the album is not very well sung. I would not recommend it to anyone expecting to like 90s music.

Amazon review: I got this album as a gift for my birthday from my friend. I had the good fortune of getting a CD that had songs that I had not had before. I was very surprised because I know that most of my music is from the 80's and 90s, but this CD did not come close to the quality of the 80's and 90's. The first song I heard was "I'm Looking Through You" and I was very surprised. It was very different compared to other songs on the album. The second song I heard was "If You Must" and I was very surprised.  It was really good. The last song I heard was "I Wanna Be Your Lover" and I was very surprised.  It was good. I actually think that the album was better than most of the songs that I heard earlier in the day. I really like it and I will buy it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the songs on this album and I think that it is pretty good. I like the fact that a lot of the songs are not just typical pop songs. The lyrics are deep and the music is very unique. I don't really know why it is called a "pop" album, but it is. I am very disappointed with this album though. I agree with the negative comments, it's not very well sung, and it is not a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really liked this album! I was expecting a little bit of the 80's, but it is very 80's.  The songs are very well written and the music is good.  It's a really good album! I gave it a 5/5 rating.

Cher

Cher, a.k.a. Cher, is an American singer-songwriter, actress, businesswoman, humanitarian, and humanitarian activist. She is known for her hits such as “Believe,” “Come into My Life,” and “Believe Again.” According to the 2010 Grammy Awards, she was the first person to win Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Performance, while also winning Best New Artist.

Cher was born in New York City in 1969. Her mother was working in the fashion industry when she met Cher's father, a Broadway producer, at a New York City nightclub. Cher's father was an active performer in the Broadway community. By age five, she started singing at piano bars. At age seven, she began performing at local clubs and theaters, first as a soloist and later with a duo. She became the lead singer of a pop group called Cher, after they began recording material in the late 1980s. They achieved success with their debut album, Believe (1989). It sold over a million copies and earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Their follow-up album, Believe Again (1990), is often considered the quintessential pop music album of the 1990s. The album sold nearly two million copies, with the single "Believe," a song that would become her signature song, receiving a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

Amazon review: This song is just too good to not buy. It's extremely catchy. It's not what you expect from him, yet it's what you hear. His voice is just so amazing. I listened to it over and over, and the only thing that could have made it better is if he sang it with his band. I don't care about his band anymore. As a fan of Toni Braxton, it's a song that should be played at every show. Toni Braxton is a great vocalist, and her voice is just pure and beautiful.

Amazon review: I saw this song in a store and bought it. It's a nice little country song that people are always asking me about. I have been listening to it for the past month. It's about a lady who finds that she can't live a lie and can't live her life. She says it's okay to be who you are, but she can't be a liar and live a lie.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

I was expecting a nice CD with some cool songs, but what I got was an album of songs without any cohesion. The album is not bad, it's just that it was a complete and utter mess to listen to.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Purchased this and it never did show up in my account.

Amazon review: I was a little nervous to purchase this album. This is the story of a group of friends who would come together to form a band when they were teenagers. Eventually, they had their first real success and went on to become a household name in the metal scene. This album was released back in 2003. I was a little skeptical at first, but a few of the songs on this album really have me feeling inspired and excited about Metal. I feel like this is one of those albums that you can listen to while you are driving or dozing off and still feel like you have accomplished something.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There's an old saying that "good music comes from good bands, bad music comes from poor bands, and the middle gets really fucked." I'm not sure if this is true, but there are a lot of awesome bands out there. This record stands out from the rest of the pack by a mile. The band is good. The album is great. The songs are excellent. The band is just fantastic.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first track starts with some great guitar riffs and drums, and then the bass enters. The next track is almost like a metal version of a progressive rock song, with lots of high-pitched vocals and very powerful guitar lines. The guitar playing in the next track is very good, and it has a very cool intro with the guitar riff that is very heavy and loud. The guitar playing in the next few tracks is pretty good, and they always put on a great performance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this a few times now, and it is just as good as the first time I heard it. It is a very slow paced album, but I really enjoy that. I am a huge fan of bands that have a slower, more mellow sound. This is one of those bands. The guitar solos are just as great as they were on the first time I heard this. It is just as good as the first time I heard it. The bass is also amazing and really adds a good feeling to the band. The vocals are very good, and the band members are all very talented. The album is very well put together, and the songs are very good.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was interested in learning about the band "Sleeper,"  and I'd never heard of them.

Also, I know that this band has been on "The Late Show with David Letterman" at least 25 times,  and I'm not sure I can get to see them.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I was glad to hear this album.  I was pretty disappointed.  I thought it would be similar to a "Christian metal" album, but it isn't.

I can't stand to listen to it at all.  The only song I could listen to was "Dying in the Water" because it is an awesome song.  I'm not sure why I liked it and the rest of the songs didn't.  I'm not a fan of Christian music and I feel like I would have gotten more out of this album if it was more of a Christian album.  I will give it another try, but I won't buy it again.

Amazon review: Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: This album will definitely be my new favourite. I love Pink Floyd when I listen to the old classics. I love the Dark Side of the Moon when I listen to it. I am also a big fan of Syd Barrett and thought he would be the perfect addition to the Pink Floyd. I don't know how I managed to not get this album... I have seen it in many places. Its not on the shelves here or anywhere else. The fact that it is out of print is a real shame because, if I had known it existed, I would have bought it. The fact that it is not out of print is a real shame. I can't get this album. I will just have to live without it. I can't listen to this album. I will miss it. Thanks for the opportunity to be one of the first to buy a copy. I am sorry.

Amazon review: I had to listen to this twice to make sure that it wasn't some trick of memory. The second listen was much better, and a lot better than the first. It's not that the music is bad, it's that the lyrics are so bad.

Amazon review: This is one of those albums that should have never been made. The songs are not worth $20.00. They were written by a guy who had a huge ego and was making albums for the money. I just hope he can see it was a fluke. He had a lot of money to spend and he wasted it all. He also has to be the guy who made Pink Floyd hate all the other bands. They should hate all the other bands. They should give Roger and Syd a Nobel Peace Prize.

Amazon review: I'm a big Pink Floyd fan, but Roger's new solo album was just way over my head. As I was listening to it, I kept thinking, this is a complete waste of time. I just don't like the sound of some of the songs. I was amazed at how bad it was. There are several songs on the album that I was thinking, "How could someone come up with this?" It's just so bad. I'm glad I got to hear some of their old stuff because this is way over my head.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is one of the first albums I ever bought. I fell in love with the music from the first time I heard it. I remember when I first heard it, I was blown away by the music. It blew me away. I remember, I was in the car, driving to school, and I could feel the music in the car. I could feel the music in my body. I can't understand why it wasn't released. It would have been a real treat to have this album when I was a kid.

Amazon review: I can't decide whether to love this or hate this. I mean, I do love it, but I have issues with some of the lyrics. And the sound is too high to me. I just can't. It's the best album I've heard. I love the music and I love the lyrics. I'm going to buy the new album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is what the song sounds like when it is played live.  You know, the one with the electric guitars and drum machine.  (Not the electric guitar and drum machine.  The ones that do the 'electric guitar and drum machine' part.)  This is a great song even though it is written by a couple of guys from the band.  It is the song that makes me realize that there is more in this band than meets the eye.  I hope they continue to be able to write like this. 
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the title track - and that is all I can judge from the song.  The song was pretty good - even if I had to do some work on it to get it to where it is now

Amazon review: This is not a bad song.  It just didn't do it for me. The song is a little bit slow for my tastes.  The music is somewhat sparse and there are a few too many vocal effects.  I felt this song was a little bit too short for my taste.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good song, but it is just a bit too long.  The sound effects are a little bit annoying.  This is a good song, but a bit too long.

Amazon review: I think this song is very good.  It has a great melody and is very energetic.  The only thing that is bothering me is the vocals.  The vocals were too high and had a lot of "pop" where they should have just had the sound of the guitar.  The guitar solos were a little bit off also.  I personally don't mind the vocal effect, but they should have done something about it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed this song, but the lyrics are a little bit too much for me to take.  The song is a positive message about life, and it is something that I can listen to and get a lot of enjoyment out of, but there are a few words that I cannot take.  The lyrics are almost too much to take, but I still appreciate the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is another one that I really enjoyed.  The first time I heard it, I thought there was not enough guitar playing, but it has grown on me.  Overall, there is no problems with this song.  The guitar playing is really good.  It is the lyrics that I don't really care for.  They are a little too much and make me feel like you are telling me to go and join a cult.  The words are not bad.  They are just repetitive and too much.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song, even though it has some flaws.  The lyrics are a bit too much for me to take, but the song is very cool.

Amazon review: This song was ok.  There was little guitar parts that were a little too much for my taste.  The lyrics are a little bit too much for my taste.  I have to work on the guitar parts, as they are a little bit too much for my taste.  The vocals are ok, but they were a little too bright for my taste.  The song is a little bit too cool for my taste.  There is not much guitar played.  The lyrics are a little bit too much for my taste.
