Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

Amazon review: This is the third time I've purchased this song. I was so excited to finally own it but when I went to play it on my ipod it would not play. I was hoping that I could play the song in my car but it wouldn't even play on my ipod when I plugged it in. I had to download the song to my computer and then play it on my ipod [with a different song]. But I wish I had ordered the vinyl version because I don't think I would get to be the first person to own this song when I play it in my car.

Amazon review: I bought a CD of this song and I heard the song on the radio. I went to get the CD thinking that I would be able to play it at my house. But when I got to the music store, I was told that this CD would not play on my iPod. So I bought it on the internet. I put it into my CD player and thought that this would be the one time that I would be able to play it. But it wouldn't play there either. But I was able to download it and burn it to a CD. I hope that this will work fine on my iPod. I had a problem with the CD player not working. I put in the music CD that I had purchased. But no matter how many times I played it, it wouldn't play. I was able to download a program and transfer the music to my computer and play it. But I don't know how to transfer music to other machines. I bought it because I was looking for a music CD that I could use in my car. I hope that my iPod will work and that I will be able to play the songs.

If you like country music, you should check out The Highwaymen.  The Highwaymen is a band that was based out of Nashville.  They were formed in the 70s, and had a big break on the country music scene.  They still have a hit song called "Little White Lies".  It has been covered by many artists from the likes of Garth Brooks to George Strait to Little Jimmy Dickens to Johnny Cash, to the likes of Johnny Cash.  The song has been remade by many artists, but I think the Highwaymen version is the best.  I hope this song gets a little more play on the country radio stations.  I hope it gets to number one on the country radio stations.  I hope it gets to number one, as I can't stand it when I hear it.  It is so bad that I can't stand it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This album is a compilation of songs recorded during the 1970's by Bob Seger.  The album is primarily an all-star effort and includes many of Seger's biggest hits and is definitely one of Seger's best albums.  However, the album has some bad songs on it.  I find that the worst ones are:
"I Don't Miss You"  This song is so bad that it almost makes you want to throw the album out the window.  It's a cover of a 1970's gospel song but sounds like a bad country song that was made worse by being mixed in with Seger's rock guitar.  It also sounds as if it was recorded in an old church or a church basement.  Just sayin'.
"The Ballad Of Frankie And Johnny"  This is a song that is so bad that it almost makes you cringe.  It sounds like a country song but doesn't have any country in it at all.  It's also very annoying that the words are completely out of place and don't fit with the melody.  The chorus is a very annoying sing-along.  The words don't make any sense and the melody is extremely annoying.  It really makes me want to throw the album out the window.
"The Ballad Of Frankie And Johnny (Reprise)"  This is a very boring song.  It sounds like it was recorded in the 1930's and is really boring.  There's nothing special about this song.
"The Ballad Of Frankie And Johnny (Reprise)" (reprise)  This is a reprise of the beginning song.  It's really annoying that the words aren't even close to the beginning of the song, let alone the chorus.  It's also annoying that the melody is also out of place and doesn't fit with the song.  The words are also out of place and the chorus is very annoying.  Overall, this song is just an annoying waste of time.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since about 1996, although I don't remember when exactly.  I believe my first purchase from them was "Visions" - which was about the time I discovered the band.  I have only gotten around to buying the other three CDs.  I was very disappointed in them all.

Amazon review: I've liked this band since I first heard the album, which was probably around 1997.  However, I've recently added to my collection and am very pleased with all of my purchases, so I'm happy to put this one into my "I love" pile.  I've tried to be patient, but I just can't seem to find a good album that has all of the things that I love about this band.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of its cover:  "The first time I saw them live, I was amazed by their performance.  The energy was just off the charts, and I was hoping to find a live CD that would be worthy of my hard-earned money.  I was completely wrong."

Amazon review: They are the band that I started listening to in the early 90's.  I think they are one of the best bands of that era.  I'm now a fan of all the other bands they've released.  I've tried to find a good cd by this band, but have been unsuccessful until now.  This album is a great one.  I'm excited to listen to it again.  Great songs, great guitar playing, but not a lot of bass.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of this band from the beginning.  They were my favorite band when I was in high school....until I actually got to a few concerts in college.  This cd is a great introduction to this band and I was very pleased with it.  The band still sounds great, and they are still playing a lot of good music.

Amazon review: The CD is the best cd I have ever bought.  I bought this when I was 16 or 17 and it was one of the first CDs I ever bought.  I've bought every cd since then, every cd I could find that was good.  I was pretty upset when I found out they were breaking up, then I found out that they had a new album out and it was the best cd I have ever bought.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the best cd I've tried so far.  I tried to buy this cd because I loved the band and wanted to try to find a cd that would be worth getting.  I was pretty disappointed when I got it, but I thought to myself, "I can listen to this some more."  Then I listened to it again, and I started to like it more and more.  It is just too bad there is no live cd by this band.  They are a very good band and they deserve to be heard.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I like it better than the "Visions" cd that I got in the early 1990s.  But I have to admit that I feel that it is better than the Visions album.

So this one is my favorite.

Amazon review: This is my first cd in many moons...I listen to most of them from cassette.  I used to be a fan of this band.  I was a huge fan.  I used to buy all their records.  But about 5 years ago I lost my cd's at the library.  So I was without my cd's for about 5 years.  But I have been searching and searching...I saw a review of this cd and I thought I would try to find it at a library.  But when I got there...there was no place to buy it.  So I walked out.  I called them and they said they had to order it.  So I was still without my cd's.  I walked out and called my mom and asked her if she would buy it for me.  She bought it for me and I put up the money.  So now I am a huge fan of this band.  I have been a fan of this band since I was about 13.  I have a cd by the band that I bought in 1996.  It is my cd that I have been listening to the longest.  It

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I was a little bit surprised by the amount of time that was spent on the actual interview. It was very interesting to hear about the past and present of the band and the story of how the band started, but the interview felt very rushed and not authentic.

I found this to have a very positive vibe, but that vibe did not carry through throughout the entire experience.

Music review: The new album by "The Man" is good, but not great, and they do need to get back to the roots of "The Golden Age" with the old-school classics. Some of the tracks are too short and not long enough to make it a satisfying listen. The new album has a much better song selection than the last one. The new album is mostly instrumental so I wish they would get back to the good old rock, instead of going back to the "blues".

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This song gets the job done, but really only makes the song feel dark, which is not what "Fire" was trying to do. This song is really just a cover of "Do You Want to Be My Baby," which has been covered by the likes of Cibo Matto and others, and is an easy song to dance to. I don't really like this song, but I do like the other two songs, so I don't mind it. I don't really know how the song title fits in with the song, but the song is still enjoyable, even if I don't like it, and I think it makes the whole disc a little better.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

The music is good, but the songs are just a bunch of generic pop songs from the 1950's and early 1960's.  I did not care to even listen to this.

Amazon review: The Ray Sinatra Orchestra - I'm On My Way - I'm On My Way - I'm On My Way.  This is not a very good album.  I think that the Ray Sinatra Orchestra is very good at playing for people.  They are a group that could have been on the radio.  They are also very popular with the public.  I don't think that they have any special skills for singing.  The songs are very generic, and very weak.  The main reason that I gave this album a 3 star rating is that I did not like listening to the entire album.  It took me a long time to get through the songs because there are too many of them.  You will have about 10 songs on this album.  It is an easy album to get through, but it is very boring.  The music is generic, and very generic.  I would recommend that you get the original version of "I'm On My Way" instead of this version.  If you want to hear Sinatra, I suggest that you get his version of "The Man I Love".  I would also suggest that you get "The Way You Look Tonight", which is a song that people like.  Listen to Ray's version of this song.  It is good.  It is not as good as the Ray Sinatra Orchestra version, but very good.  I would recommend that you get the Ray Sinatra Orchestra version of "I'm On My Way".  The song is good, but the song is very generic.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just started this album but so far, I like it, I don't know if it's me or if it's the listener. I guess I'll know when I listen to the whole album. I'm really curious to know what happens between the songs. I'm a fan of Leonard Cohen's work so I'll probably be listening to this album for a long time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I am really into Leonard Cohen and I enjoy his music a lot. I like the cover but the actual music is not really good. Very repetitive and it's not very good. I don't think I will re-listen to this unless I find a way to listen to it without my headphones, or turn it off.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album, but it just doesn't sound like Leonard Cohen. It's the same old crap with some new songs thrown in. The best part is the cover with the face of the devil. I'll probably listen to it.

Amazon review: This is a very good album. It's not quite Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", but it's not bad. It has an interesting title and a few good songs but the rest of the album is pretty average. I'll probably buy it when Leonard Cohen releases a new album.
