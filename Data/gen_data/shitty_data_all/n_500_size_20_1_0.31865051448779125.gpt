Lyrics

I got a girl who don't give a damn about no music
She don't give a damn about no music we only got a dollar
She say she don't want no music
She don't want no music
She don't want no music
She wanna have a good time
She wanna have a good time
I like to spend all my money on something
Something for my mind
Something to occupy me
I don't need no music in my life
I don't need no music in my life

She got an old man who don't know what he's doing
He don't know what he's doing he don't know what he's doing
He don't know what he're doing he don't know what he's doing
He don't know who he's dealing with
He don't know who he's dealing with
He don't want no music, don't want no music
He don't want no music, don't want no music
Hiding out in his hotel room with a smile on his face
Hiding out in his hotel room with a smile on his face, yeah
(This is the censored version)

I got a girl who don't give a damn about no money

She don't want no music, she want a good time
She wanna have a good time

He don't know what he's doin' he don't know what he's doin'
He don't know who he's dealing with

He don't want no music in his life
He don't even know who he's dealing with
He don'll want no music in his life, he don't even know who he's dealing with
He don't even know who he is dealing with

He don't care who he's dealing with, he don't care who he's dealing with

Hiding out in his hotel room with a smile on his face.
Hiding out in his hotel room with a smile on his face yeah, yeah yeah
You can tell it by how he's dancing and by the way he's smiling

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: Wow.  I've only heard a few of the songs on this, but I'm going to assume they are really good.  There are a few tracks that are very hard to find on iTunes--"The Beginning," "Bones," and "Take Me Away"--but they're all great, very catchy, and will grow on you.  The rest of this CD is a mix of old favorites and new ones.  The two songs I've already heard are "It's Gonna Get Better" and "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out," which is a very powerful song and a good one to start off with.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really have never heard of this band, but I'm really excited to try out some of the tracks.  I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but it seems like they're getting more popular and I have heard that they are releasing a new EP that I would love to hear.

Amazon review: This CD is a great addition to any collection.  It is very well performed and well produced.  It is a great way to start one's collection of rap metal.  The only problem is that the lyrics are very basic and not too detailed.  However, this is part of the reason why it is so good.

Amazon review: This is a great record.  It's a very well produced, fun, and energetic album.  The best songs are the two that I have heard so far: "It's Gonna Get Better" and "Take Me Away."

Another great thing about this album is that it is very well produced and the vocals are very clear.

Amazon review: This is the best rap metal CD that I have ever heard.  The music is great, the lyrics are very catchy, and the performances are excellent.  This is a very fun CD.  It's a great way to start your collection of good rap metal.  I was a little disappointed that the liner notes say that the album was "composed" by "Loudmouth" and not "Loudmouth's," but I guess that's to be expected.

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album for a while, but when I heard it was re-released I decided to get it on CD.  I was very disappointed the first time I heard it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This album is very easy to listen to and the overall sound is a little more mature and polished than the first.  I do not understand the re-release of a CD, but I do understand that a band is getting another CD to be reviewed.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I enjoyed the music and the singing.  I did not enjoy listening to it as a group, but rather as it was presented in one long piece.  I am not sure why I liked it the other way.  I found several of the songs extremely boring and repetitive, but that was not an issue with the others.  The instrumentals and vocals are fine, but the lyrics are just too much.  The vocals are very similar to the ones in "The Lord Has Touched My Heart" which is a very good CD.  The songs on this CD are much better and the instrumentals are much better.  They have a different musical concept, which I find interesting, and they do it better.  So, even if you don't like the instrumentals and vocals, you may still like the music.  If you enjoy the songs, then you will enjoy this CD.  Overall, I would give this CD a 2.5 star rating. I would recommend it if you are a Christian who likes good music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would only recommend this CD for the singing and the instrumentals.  The vocals are very good but the instrumentals are not as good.  The songs are not memorable, and they do not have a good message.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone but a Christian.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!
