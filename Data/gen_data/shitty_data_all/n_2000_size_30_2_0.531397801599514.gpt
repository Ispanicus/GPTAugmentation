Amazon review: The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song- it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.

Amazon review: Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders. A complete and utter waste of  money and time. This depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence, but will certainly line the pockets of Daniel Goleman.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I agree with the above negative review. I think that this is a great album and I have been using it to help me work on my own emotional intelligence. The first album is good too. I bought this because it is recommended by someone in the office. Not sure if I should return it. I will probably put it on a playlist that I have with some of my favourite songs.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away.

Amazon review: Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders. A complete and utter waste of  money and time. This depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence, but will certainly line the pockets of Daniel Goleman.

Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a lot of respect for this band. They are one of the few bands to do a proper cover of a song I like (and in my opinion, one of the best covers ever!). I feel like when I hear "Hey Youngblood" it brings me back to the days when I could just be myself with my friends (and no one judged me). I always felt like I was cool because I knew a few people in school, or in the band, who were really cool. Now that I think of it, I know I have a lot of those songs in my ears. I've never been a huge fan of the Beatles, but this is a great Beatles cover. The only thing I don't like is the fact that the guitar solo on "Hey Youngblood" is a little too short, I would have preferred more time on the last two notes.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought the CD the day it was released and I was not disappointed. I am a big fan of the band and I was delighted to hear that they were recording a live album.

It's one of the best covers I have heard to date.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: The vast majority of this CD are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice. Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous.

However, I must disagree with the description of the music on the compilation as "The Greatest Collection Of Jim Reeves Records", as this would be a lie.

The songs themselves are all from albums that he recorded for various labels. The compilation itself is a collection of songs that he recorded for various labels, and a few that he recorded for himself.

Amazon review: Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: This CD shows no sign of improvement.  The vocals on the lead and harmony parts are atrocious.  The instruments are not bad, but not really memorable.  He is not an outstanding vocalist, but he is in the top five of my favorite vocalists.  I do not like the Beatles, and this is the first I've heard of him, but the music is great and the vocals are great.  I do not recommend this CD.

Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

This is the best Beatles album that I have ever heard.
I listen to it while commuting to work. On my commute I have listened to this album on at least 10 occasions on my way to work.
It blows my mind.
Very emotional, and beautiful.
I hope that the Beatles will one day bring this album back to the world.

I love this album, and this song is just excellent, I wish that I had seen this album when it first came out. It is a classic that has not been repeated yet. It is such a simple song that I have been playing this song over and over again on my ipod and my car stereo. It is a great piece of music.

This is a great album, I just started listening to it a few days ago. Loved all of the songs on it. It is very well produced and the vocals are great. I wish the Beatles would do another album like this one. They are a great band.

This is a great Beatles album but I have to add I don't understand the hate towards this album. I have listened to every Beatles album and this is my favorite by far. The songs are great, the vocals are great, the production is great and I still love this album. It's a perfect soundtrack for a rainy day.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

Amazon review: Manakin Moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band Waxing Poetics, who were a regional favorite in the Norfolk, Virginia, area.  It's a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind.  Highly recommended.  Wannabe singers, just try to learn the lyrics on this one!

Amazon review: I guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy. I think I was spoiled on the old Chicago. Kind of like the 72/73 Miami Dolphins. I expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another Super Bowl. Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review: Never heard this version before! would have been nice to have been nice if l had been made aware that there was various artists. This is not even the guy who wrote the song (Cohn?or Cohen?) Even though llove the song l had to delete this version immediately! Waste of money

Amazon review: I love this song.  I hate that it's been removed from radio, etc.  What a waste.  Why can't we have this song on our radios?  I can't believe people are so against this song.  I'm sure if you played this song on your radio you'd have a lot of people saying "That's the saddest song I've ever heard!"  It's been a very sad day for me.

Amazon review: In this clip, the 'rapper' is a very young boy.  I am in total agreement with the parent that the lyrics are not appropriate for children's ears.  I am a teacher and I'm very concerned that these lyrics are being taught to our students.  The only way I can find to help correct this is to not use these lyrics in my classroom.  I have students that are 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13 years old.  I don't want to be responsible for them being exposed to this.  I will have to teach this song from another source.  It is very upsetting to me to think that this is being taught to our students.

Amazon review: Love this song.  I've heard the version that was made popular by Katy Perry, and I've heard the version that was made popular by Bruno Mars, and I've heard the version that is being made popular by Lady Ga Ga, and I'm totally in love with all of these songs.  I thought Bruno Mars' version was the best.  I would love it if Lady Ga Ga's version was made popular.  I think it would sell a lot of tickets and get millions of views.

Amazon review: I had heard of this song before but never heard it in my life.  I'm in total agreement with the parent that the lyrics are inappropriate for children's ears.  I think it's wrong for anyone to be able to buy, sell, or trade a song that is being used by a grown man and woman.  It's not right.  I have a daughter that will be 15 years old and I will not be letting her hear this song or any song that uses the word 'bitch' in a song.  I will not let her hear it.  I am in total agreement with the parent.

Amazon review: The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song- it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.

Amazon review: ACCK! Michael Allen Harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saws. RUN AND HIDE! It sounds like. sorta like weird whistling. If the sawing was taken out it would have been an O.K album. I rated it 1 star because there was no -200 star. :(. All of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible. I think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad. If you're wondering, this CD was free at the Michael Allen Harrison Christmas Concert and I THOUGHT it would be decent.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: Where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyrics go? While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").  Dan manages to save some of the album with "Off The Map" and "Fine," but once again, they lyrics are sub par.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Rob Zombie has been making music for a long time now.  He is a master of the darker sound, using his guitar to take the listener into a place of darkness. He takes all of his influences, from Led Zeppelin to Black Sabbath, and blends them all together into his own personal style. He is also a master storyteller, with his songs telling a story, not just describing what it feels like to be there, but describing everything that happens in that scene, including the people there and the place they live in. The music is very powerful and the lyrics are dark and intense.  This is a very unique album that I would recommend to anyone!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Rob Zombie's latest album is a dark and brooding, yet uplifting album.  The title track "Hellbilly Delux" is the album's highlight, although it is the song "Kiss Me When I'm Dead" that has really got me.  I love the lyrics.  If you've seen Rob Zombie films, you've probably heard him do things like this.  Rob Zombie has now returned to the dark sound that made him famous and a great album for the dark and evil music fan.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first time I listened to this album I was quite interested in it, because of the good reviews I had read about it.  But then I started to get bored with it.  It reminded me of other dark metal bands like Behemoth (which, by the way, is my favorite band in the world, as I've been listening to them since I was in high school.)  I was very interested in this album, but it was just mediocre.

Amazon review: Rob Zombie has done it again.  He has created a great dark music album.  I don't know much about him, but I like his music very much.  I have been listening to his music since I was in high school, and I've always been a fan of his music.  I thought I had heard most of his albums, but when I got to his new album, I found out that it was his first new album in 8 years!  I think this is a very good album.  I would recommend it to the fans of this style of music.

Amazon review: Rob Zombie's new album is just excellent.  He is a great song writer, and this album has the best songs of his career.  His new album is a return to his dark musical style, and it is really good.  Rob Zombie is one of my favorite bands, and this album is just perfect.  He is one of the best song writers of our generation.  I hope to see him live in the near future, and I look forward to his music.

Amazon review: Rob ZZ, Zombie, is one of the best songwriters in the business.  His voice is the perfect combination of power and sadness.  His musical style is very different from the rest of metal, but he does it well.  He has been a band member with a few other bands, and he did his first solo album.  His voice is very powerful and he has good lyrics.  This is an album to buy, listen to, and enjoy.  You will not be disappointed.

Amazon review:         This is a nice dance for beginners.  It's not the best that I have ever seen, but it is a good beginning piece.   The choreography is good, and the music is a little bit different from what I usually like.  I think maybe I'll get used to it.  For now, I don't really like the piece.   It's just too short.    I don't know how long it's supposed to be.  I think that it's supposed to be about 30 minutes.   I don't know!  Maybe there's a "tune" to it or something.    I don't know if my time is up.     I'm going to do a time trial to see if I can get a new record.     I don't really like this.  I don't like the music at all.     You should use a better song.  It's annoying.     It's very boring.

From the first song to the last I was captivated and at first thought that I had hit the jackpot but the quality of the songs is not that good. While the first song is nice the songs after that are awful. The first track "Heartbreaker" has no more than a few notes but they are very annoying and the singer sounds like a high school girl. It is an obvious rip off of "Heartbreaker" and "Crazy" have more of the same. "Heartbreaker" has a very annoying and annoying "dee-dee" sound. The other songs are good but I felt like I was walking to a fast food restaurant and the song selection was limited.
