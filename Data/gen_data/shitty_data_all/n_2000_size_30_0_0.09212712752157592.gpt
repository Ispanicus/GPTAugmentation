I've been a fan of George Skaroulis ever since I stumbled upon him at a Greek Festival some years back.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.

Amazon review: I've had this album on for over a week and I can't say I've noticed a difference in my listening.  At most, it's a little bit quicker than I was expecting.  I don't understand the hype about this album.  I thought it was going to be more like their previous works, but it isn't.  It's not BAD, it's just not really worth listening to.  I'm sure there's a lot more to it than the average person realizes, but I can't find it.  I can't wait to listen to the rest of their discography, but I can't take a chance on this one.  I don't know why there was a "10" in the reviews, because it clearly isn't worth the price.

Amazon review: I've never been a fan of Felt.  I liked a lot of their work, but I always found their sound to be a little too cheesy for my taste.  I've listened to this album a couple times, and I don't think it improves on the previous attempts.

At best, it's a slightly better version of their previous work, and at worst, it's a complete waste of time.  I don't understand why anyone would buy this crap.  It's bland and boring, and it's just not worth the money.  I'd rather listen to something by a band that I can actually relate to, instead of something that I can only think of as boring.

Amazon review: I have listened to them all, and I have to say that I've never been so disappointed in a band's music before.  I feel like I've wasted my time listening to this over the past few weeks.  It is nothing more than a mediocre pop album.  I'm really disappointed with the quality of the music.

Amazon review: I have some pretty strong opinions about this CD, but I'll let them be known. I like the music, but the singer, Bob Dylan, is a little off. He sounds like he is either playing or singing his own music. I don't know how to describe it. I am a huge fan of his music, but his style and delivery of his songs are very different from his albums. He's a very good singer, so I like the music, but I don't think it was his best. The other songs sound okay to me, but I don't know if I'll ever get around to purchasing this album.

Amazon review: Once I'd downloaded this song, I felt deceived by the sample clip available here. Cincotti definitely has potential, but he ruined what could've been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range. He sounded rather screechy. The title track was also somewhat misleading, because it led me to expect a slow, tender seduction song, not a sad one. I do think Peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Lyrically, it's just the right size for a movie, or a drama.  The music is perfectly suited to the lyrics, and the harmonies never fail to give a lovely atmosphere.  I love the way that Bonnie Tyler's voice can be so soft and sweet, but also have that little bit of edge that makes you feel she could be just as fierce in a fight as she is on stage.  The music and lyrics work together very well to create a very unique and memorable song.  I highly recommend that any and all who love this song give it a listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Bonnie Tyler's voice is not like anyone else's.  It's a unique and pure tone with an emotion that is hard to put your finger on.  One of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.  She sings in harmony with a choir, and it makes you feel like you're in a movie.  You can almost hear the actors in the movie and feel the emotion through the music.  I would like to see a film based on this song.

Amazon review: This is a very good movie.  It has a lot of humor and well-written dialogue.  I especially like the way that the movie's characters are written.  I hope more movies like this come out.  In fact, I think more movies like this are needed.  Good movies need good music.

Amazon review: Cincotti's voice sounds very different than Bonnie Tyler's.  He sings in the same key as Bonnie, but the song is so different from Bonnie's that it's hard not to imagine that the two were recorded together.  This has a very good sound to it.  I would say that it is very different from any other song that I've heard that has Bonnie's voice.  I would recommend that anyone who loves this song give it a listen.  It is a very good song.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

Once you listen to it, then you look at the album cover and decide, "that's great, I love that album", and then you listen to it again and decide, "oh, I don't care for that album as much as I did the first time, I don't like that album but I will buy it again, because I really like it".

I love this album and I will buy it again.  But, I will not buy it again on CD.  It's great to have on your computer, but to have it on CD makes it a pain in the neck.

Amazon review: "A little too much of a waste of time" is the only comment I can bring to this review.  The other comments are a bit harsh.  I like the album quite a bit.  I also like the album's first single "I'm Sorry" by the Black Keys.  It is a very good song.  I don't like the album though.  The lyrics are just plain annoying.  It has lots of vocal effects and a lot of vocal rapping.  The vocals are okay, but they are not as powerful as I would like.  The song is very very good though and it is the best thing on the album.  It is a good song.  The album is a very good one although I don't like the album.  I don't like the album because of the lyrics.  They are really annoying and they are not very good.  I like the album a lot.

The All Time Greatest Country Album from Waylon Jennings

by

I was introduced to Waylon Jennings by my wife at a concert and we have been listening to him for years. I bought his Greatest Hits album on vinyl when it came out and I was a huge fan.
Since then I have bought and sold quite a few of his CDs (including his Greatest Hits). I decided to buy his latest album All Time Greatest Country Album in hopes that it would be as good as his other CDs.
I have listened to it for the last two days and I have to say it is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I haven't been listening to country music very long but I've heard way too many albums that have disappointed me.
Waylon's album is one of the best country albums I have ever heard. He has a great voice and his songs are great. He is very unique in that he is able to write great songs even though he is a country singer. He has an incredible talent. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who likes country music.

I have listened to it for the last two days and I can say that it is one of the best country albums I have ever heard. I have been listening to country for a long time and I can say that I think this album is better than most of the popular country albums. I don't like this album much but I can say that it is pretty decent.
I am not impressed by the new songs that he has written and I don't understand why I can't like them. I think he should have written them all over and done some interesting things with them or just left some of them out. I don't like his new songs that he has written for this album.
However, I believe that his songs have been written for his fans.
I have not really listened to the other albums that he has released

Amazon review: This is a very creative piece of music, which I think is great. It has a very powerful, almost hypnotic effect on the listener.  I'd describe it as a kind of 'psychedelic' or 'alternative rock'  with a hint of jazz and '70s soul.  It's a very interesting and challenging piece of work, which I am sure you will enjoy.  It's about time that we came out of the closet and told the truth about what we really are.  I don't see myself as a member of any of the bands mentioned here, but I have enjoyed listening to them and have been inspired by them.  I think you will be too.  Enjoy!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing that strikes me is just how diverse this band is.  I don't know if I would describe them as jazz, or as 'alternative.  But they are definitely jazz/rock fusion.  It's an amazing sound.  The second thing is how well they know how to blend all sorts of sources together in interesting ways.  I'm not sure if that's jazz, or not, but I love it.  When I first started listening to this CD, I was not sure it was going to be anything special, but the more I listened, the more I thought it was amazing.  I think that the other thing is the way the music plays out.  You can really feel the musical content being used as a vehicle for the lyrics, which really makes this CD stand out.  I also really liked the way the lyrics are given so much room to breathe.  In other words, you can really hear the band being themselves.  I think you will too.  Enjoy!

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

Amazon review: I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.

And I love MANOWAR but man, this album is just too many songs for it to be good.  There are way too many bad songs and it was a mistake to put this on the album.  It is a waste of my time.  The only good song is "You're No Good" and it is one of MANOWAR's best songs.  I am a MANOWAR fan and I think there is a good chance I will buy another MANOWAR album.

They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.

I would not say it is the best, but it is a good package with some good songs on it.

Amazon review: I had tried this album on my phone the first time and while it sounded great, I was not impressed with the sound quality. Now, after about a year of daily use, I can say that it is one of the best sounding albums I have ever heard. That is because the songs are all recorded in the best sound quality possible. I have not listened to this CD in months, but I am hearing new things. The only negative thing I can say is that I will be keeping the disc in my vinyl collection until I feel I can no longer listen to it. I like that this CD is a bit different from most of the others and is worth its price.

amazon review: I have always been a fan of the Beatles, but I only discovered them when I was about 12 and started watching videos on YouTube. I listened to all of their albums, but this is the only one I have not heard. This album is great and I was surprised that I didn't like it more than I did.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Beatles since I was a child. I bought all of their albums and listen to them all. I have always liked the Beatles, but I didn't listen to this album until this year. I have listened to it every day. This was the first album in a long time that I couldn't wait for me to come home and play it. It is such an awesome album. It is the best album I have ever heard. I love this album because it makes me cry every time I listen to it.

Amazon review: This album is a mix of both the Beatles and the Motown sound. I have been a fan since the Beatles' first album came out in the early 70s and I was fortunate enough to actually see them live in concert. I was hooked. Every CD I have ever owned and listened to has been a Beatles album. This is the first time that I have ever heard a Beatles' album that sounds like Motown. I think this album is a great mix of both worlds.

Amazon review: Good CD, but a bit boring. The songs are well done but the album is a bit boring. Some of the songs were not my cup of tea, but when you listen to them you get to the "wow" part and then they are over and it is time to move on to the next song. There are no real standout songs, but the songs are very good and I am happy I got the album.

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside. It's got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time.  Aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 lines of lyrics with no substance, they "borrow" the can-can song and make it even more irritating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I thought it was a song by the Kinks. It's got a good beat, but it's not a catchy song. You just know it's going to be a dud.

Evanescence album review: This is an amazing album, but there are a few tracks that are a bit repetitive and annoying.

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Amazon review: Phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th Century Records from the great pianist Ahmad Jamal with the other two members of his trio, Jamil Nasser on bass and Frank Gant on drums, along with Azzedin Weston in a very prominent role on congas, and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by Richard Evans. All six selections on the album were written by Ahmad and he produced it as well. "Jamal Plays Jamal" is a CLASSIC that has yet to be officially released on cd.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.

Amazon review: Destined to appear on "Worst Ever" lists for decades.  Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.

Amazon review: The first and last time I heard this song was on the soundtrack for the 1989 film "The Body" starring Nicolas Cage in a very bad movie.

Amazon.com review:   This is one of the most popular songs on this album.  I have loved this song since I first heard it in 1974 on the album "The Best of Matthew West".  The band would go into the studio with the new song and play it for everyone so that we would get an idea of what the song was before we ever heard it in a live performance.  I thought this song was a great way to learn the song.  I just love the message of this song.  It's a very positive song about being happy and having a good time.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2".. But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE. . Hey, but.

Amazon review: This is Jon Anderson. I am a huge fan of his music. I was very excited when I first heard his first album "The day". I thought it was pretty good. But when I discovered that it is also Jon Anderson as well as Rick Wakeman, I thought it was a real letdown! I was disappointed because Jon Anderson always has the best voice, and singing abilities. I decided to listen to this album again.
The song "The Day" is awesome. I really liked it. But the song "Movin' Out" is boring. The song "Ain't No Sunshine" is good, although I wish it was a little longer. "I Wanna Be Your Dog" is a pretty good song, but I wish the song "All I really need" was longer.
But overall, I am really looking forward to his new album.

Amazon review: Love this song. it's truly magic!  My fave Coldplay song in a while.  Looking forward to the rest of the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review:  A bit on the rough side, but overall a good song.  It made me feel a little sad when I first heard it.  I thought it was my friend singing a few times.  It seemed so real.  I hope they can make a full length CD.  I do like the sound of this album.  I hope they don't just make it available on iTunes.  I like the idea of making an album for the whole family.  I like the idea of buying the album and then downloading it at a later date.  I don't think I'll buy it, but thought I should say that.  Just my opinion though.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  There are many reasons for this, but my favorite is the lack of lyrics and vocals.  I listened to the original as much as I could, and I still couldn't understand the lyrics.  The vocals were so pretty in the original that I just couldn't understand them.  This new version is even worse.  The lyrics are still there, but you can't understand them.  The vocals are the worst.  It sounds like a kid yelling at his parents and they are talking, but you can't hear a thing.  They're barely audible.  The original was so pretty, that I can't understand why they changed it.  The new version is so bad that it's not even worth listening to.  I don't want to listen to it again.  This is the third time that I've had to endure this album.  I've never been this disappointed before.  I do like the album, and I like the new version, but this is an album that I can't stand to listen to.  I'm done with this album.  I hope that this is the only version that I have to endure.  I will never buy another thing from Amazon.

Amazon review: There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has been a lot of the news lately, and not for her music. It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split. But for her latest single, she wants to try and recapture whom she was a singer before, and fails to do it on Papi, the third single from her album Love? The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.
