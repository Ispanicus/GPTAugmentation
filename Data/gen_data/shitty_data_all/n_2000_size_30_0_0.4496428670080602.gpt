Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

Amazon review: I really like the "Tastes Like a Man" song on this album.  I think some of this is a good reference to a movie that i think is a good one.  i think it is better than "In The Heat of The Night" and "Hey Hey Hey."

Amazon review: This album is a rip off of a lot of the music i was listening to at the time.  It has a lot of the same stuff mixed in with a few songs that are very good.  I like the song that you have mentioned,  I think it is one of the best on the album.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: There must have been a bunch of ripe songs sitting around the basement when Juliana Hatfield showed up to help record them. Some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the Mats. Others are not so great, but they may grow on me. (But not that one about birds.) I'm just happy Paul is digging out some gems and recording them in an inspired way. If it takes romance to make that happen, so much the better.

Amazon review: A great follow-up to her award winning duet with Jason Aldean and her TV show "Duets," Kelly sings with famed country artist Vince Gill to create a truly lovely song.

Amazon review: I'm not normally a fan of remixes, and in this case there is no exception. If you have not bought the original OneRepublic album (Dreaming Out Loud) that has this song on it, you are missing out. I understand Timbaland helped OneRepublic get started, but there is no reason for taking credit for someone else's song.  I feel that Timbaland's contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out. I much prefer the original mix to this version.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: I've listened to this record non-stop since I purchased it in the late 90s.  The one thing that I would have changed would be to include "You're in Love" as the first song on the EP.

This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.

Amazon review: It's great to hear an artist expand their horizons. I just wish Jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what I mean. Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: This album has some good songs mixed in with some bad songs. I have a feeling this was put together by a band of people who have no business in the music business. They sound like they were put together in a basement with $5.00. So, this is the band playing for $10.00 a night, for about 30 years? This is not music for the masses. Not at all.

Amazon review:  This is the second CD I have bought from the Jewelry Recordings site. The first CD was a compilation of songs. Jewelry Recordings is the best place for music lovers and collectors.  I have a lot of Jewelry albums, and I enjoy listening to their discography, as well as their songs. This one caught my attention because it has their biggest hit to date, "I Just Wanna Love You" I think there are more songs of this quality on their site, but, I did not want to purchase the whole disc. I thought, if they had a song like this on the site, then it would be a good CD to get. I received a CD from them, and it was a disappointment. First, the CD has some of their hits mixed in, some of which I was not really that into. Second, the CD only had 6 songs.  I have all seven songs on my CD collection. But, I did not want to purchase the whole CD just to have 6 songs. I really wanted the whole disc.  If the songs on the CD are not on their site, you can listen to them on YouTube.  If you have the original CD, you can download the song to your computer, or you can listen to it on the Jewelry Recordings site. I recommend that if you do not want the whole CD, that you download the songs to your computer.  I also have a Jewelry Music Passport. It is a free membership on the Jewelry Recordings website. I think it is a great idea for Jewelry fans to have a pass to the Jewelry Recordings site.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

Amazon review: I heard a live performance of the Imagine Dragon's and really enjoyed the music, so I ordered the album. The album unfortunately is a huge disappointment. The mastering of this album is terrible. A number of the songs on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect. When you hear the songs live, the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance. But on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music.

Amazon review: I don't really know what to say, just bought this album a couple of days ago. There was a line in the song "Sinnerman" about what a "big man" I am, and I found the lyrics to be very funny, but I still feel like I wasted my money on this album. I have never heard of this artist before, and I would have loved to have heard more music from this artist.

It's just not something that I would listen to very often.  I really wish it had more of a melody to it.  It doesn't have a very catchy melody.  The chorus is pretty good, though.

Amazon review: This is actually a great song. I am truly a died hard fan for K. Michelle so I do not mind keeping it real. It is about time she is singing something that is a "make up record." She has always recorded break-up records and albums, and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new. She is crazy, sometimes rude and take things to the extreme, but one thing that is true is that she can sing! Support real music and trust she will deliver.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

If I want some foreigner to preach to me about politics and the state of the world I will turn on the any of the left owned television stations or read the slanted truth on the internet.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was the first album that really showed the girls' singing potential.  They definitely have a beautiful voice.  But I think that their voices are a bit too strong for their age, and I feel that it sounds a bit more mature than it should at the age of 15.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get this album.  So much so, that I immediately downloaded it... and then deleted it.  First, because I couldn't stand these songs.  Then, because I had a feeling they'd be bland and boring.  I was right.  I am disappointed.  The girls are so talented that the album is a letdown.  I am ashamed to be a country lover.  The singing is beautiful, the lyrics are interesting, and the musicality is great.  But the songs are all too similar to each other, and no one stands out.  They're all so predictable.  And they're all sung by the same group of girls.  And there is no diversity to the songs.  Some are very soft, and others are very loud.  It's hard to listen to if you don't know what the music is supposed to be.  And if I knew what the songs were supposed to be about, I would have saved the album.  Anyway, all good.

It was fun to listen to them, but I couldn't get into them.  I thought they were pretty good, but they were boring.  I'm so disappointed, because I love the sisters.  They're beautiful, they have a beautiful voice, and they're so talented.  I'm so disappointed.  I love their voice, I love their music, and I love their voices.  And this album is boring.  I don't even like the music, and I don't think the songs are very good.  I love these girls so much, and I would love to hear them sing in a different style.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon: Love the album, but there are no songs that stand out in my opinion.  I don't think they're the best.  Not to mention, they were recorded when they were in high school.  It's a bit late for them to be so mature, and their voice is already in high-school territory.  They would be better if they released a few albums at a time, to get their voices out.  Or at least add some more music that they haven't released yet.  This album could be a little better.  There are a couple of songs that aren't bad, but are not all that great either.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album quite a bit.  The girls were very talented and had a beautiful voice.  Also, the album is excellent and the girls do a great job.  However, I have to say that the songs are all very similar to each other.  I don't know if they are all supposed to be related to each other, or if they are just all very similar.  I'm not sure whether it's the same group of girls singing the songs, or if they are all the same person singing them.

I have not listened to the songs long enough to determine if they are really good, but I have heard many songs that I would not want to listen to.  The songs are too similar.  Some are very slow and quiet, and some are very loud.  I don't know what the songs are supposed to be about, and I don't know if the girls are singing about themselves or the situations, or if the songs are about a situation or a person.  I am not sure if they are actually about the situations or the people, or if they are just about the

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review: What is it with "American Idol" fans and the worst albums that we can't stand? We've heard this so many times before that we're sick and tired of it.   It's hard to stand out with all the crap that Idol fans put out but we can't help it.  They're getting away with their bad taste in music because they're getting away with their bad taste in music.  Just like a few months back I posted an article about how it's hard for me to stand out on the "Idol" stage.  There are so many of us who are so sick and tired of this crap that we would rather sit and watch a good movie or read a good book.  But that's our reality. So I thought I would post my top 10 albums that I believe are the worst albums that I've heard in my life.  And you'll have to forgive me because I'm only writing in the past tense.  So I'll start with my top ten albums that I've heard in my life.
1.The Beatles -- Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (I'm not a Beatles fan so I'm writing this in the past tense.
2.Rolling Stones -- Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!!
3.Beatles -- The White Album
4.Elvis Presley -- Graceland
5.The Beatles -- The White Album
6.Led Zeppelin -- Led Zeppelin
7.The Beatles -- The White Album
8.The Beatles -- The Beatles
9.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.)
10.The Beatles -- Rock 'n' Roll Music
11.John Lennon -- Imagine
12.The Beatles -- The White Album
13.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.) (This album is not in the past tense, it's in my opinion the worst of the bunch.)
14.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.)  (This album is not in the past tense, it's in my opiniion the worst of the bunch.)
15.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.) A few other good albums that I've heard over the years:
16.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.) The Beatles -- Revolver
17.The Beatles -- Revolver
18.The Beatles -- Revolver
19.The Beatles -- Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Again in the past tense.)  (This album is not in my opiniion the worst of the bunch.)
20.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.) This album is not in my opiniion the worst of the bunch.)  (This album is not in my opiniion the worst.  It's in the past tense because I don't think any of the albums are a good album.  All of them are terrible.)
21.The Beatles -- Rock 'n' Roll Music
22.The Beatles -- Revolver
23.The Beatles -- Rock 'n' Roll Music (Again in the past tense.)
24.The Beatles -- Revolver (Again in the past tense.)
25.The Beatles -- The White Album (Again in the past tense.) I could go on and on but there are so many bad albums that I have heard over the years that just can't be listed.

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: The jewel case was badly damaged in shipment, and I despaired of having a flawless product. The CD came through in perfect condition however. I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!

Amazon review: The album was recorded in Nashville by the legendary Nashville producer Hal Willner.  This was a wonderful recording of a wonderful song.  It is a great album to take on the walk with.  I love how Hal Willner takes some of the most recognizable songs of the 60's and 70's and adds a modern twist to them.  Some of the songs are very slow, others are very fast.  Some of the songs are very traditional, but some of the songs are more country.  I hope that I can get this album on my walk.  It is a great album.  I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: I have a few albums from the 60's and 70's, but this is my all time favorite record of the 60's.  This is one of the records that I have been unable to stop listening to, so I have been trying to find another copy.  The liner notes are very informative, and I thought that the album was very well made.  I recommend this purchase, but I am sure that there are many other record collectors out there that will love this album.

Amazon review: I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "Invisible" when I first moved to Nashville.  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large soothing effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes. However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered, so I have to say that this album is not as good as I had been hoping for.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted, angry sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking. I would recommend this album, but I have to say that I am disappointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies. Tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra Bonus for us!

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.

I did not have a chance to listen to it when it was released, but I have been hearing it for years through the radio.  I was so excited when I purchased this original album from Amazon.  I was surprised.  After listening to the whole album again at the library, I am still amazed.  This CD is a must own.

This is a great cd!

I saw Gloria Bills in concert in Cadiz, KY back in October. I bought their CD and couldn't stop listening to it. "Always Sometimes" is one of my favorite songs now. Oh yeah, and the sister of the lead singer works at Sonic here...more

I bought two of these CDs. The first one is Gloria's new CD. It is not a Christmas cd but is great for all the music I love. The CDs are different enough so that you can have both.

I bought the second CD. It is a great rendition of "The Christmas Song" by the Beatles. I have a few songs on my ipod that I like better. The original "The Christmas Song" by the Beatles is great.

I have been using LiveLook for over 10 years. I started with 1 cd and now have over 120 cd's and have found a way to make them all work.

I bought this cd when the original was released as a bonus. I bought two of these and really cannot wait to listen to the other one. The first is a great version of "The Christmas Song" by the Beatles while the second is a great rendition of "The Christmas Song" by the Beatles.

I have been using LiveLook for over 10 years. Since I started using them, I have found a way to make all of my cds work. I do not know how I did it before. I know I will be using LiveLook for the rest of my life.

Amazon review: For me, all but one song made for a very good CD.  Their voices are growing in depth and enrichment.  It's different music from their first CD  Some, like my father, who loved their first CD (because it was all of the Italian favorites = and he is Italian) didn't like this second album at all.  My husband and I liked it very much!

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.

Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.

This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.

Amazon review: I've been waiting for a new album by the legendary metal band, Mötley Crüe. When it was finally released, I was surprised how much it was worth. The album starts off with a nice guitar riff and then a few good songs start to flow from it. The band then went back into a "standard" metal sound. The lead singer was noticably not present in the song writing. He was replaced by someone who was noticably less talented than the original lead singer. The songs never went anywhere, they were just average to bad. The album was only worth about $20, but a lot of people bought it.

Amazon review: This is the official soundtrack to the movie, X-Men Apocalypse. It features the best song selection I have ever heard from a movie soundtrack. The song list starts off strong and with the most popular tracks of the movie, but then a few songs start to lag and the last few songs that the movie was released with are used and the song list starts to suffer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you're a fan of music from the 90s, this album is for you. The band's music is very 80s and their sound is very "alternative." The only thing I can say here is that the music is good, but if you're a fan of the band, you will be disappointed.

Amazon review: I had a great time with this album. The songs are very different from each other, but they work well together. The vocals are very good and the song selection is very good. The first song is "Weird Al" Yankovic's greatest hit, "Mama." Then it goes to a country rock song about someone cheating on her. Then it goes to a punk song about a guy named Johnny. Finally it ends with a song about a girl named Bethany. I think this album is a great mix of different styles.

Amazon review: Not that bad of a tribute CD, but as for myself, I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp. 'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.
