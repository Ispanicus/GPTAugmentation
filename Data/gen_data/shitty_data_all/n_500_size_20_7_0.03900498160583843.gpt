It took a while to find a band from the Beatles that I actually loved, but I think I've found it by this album. The songs are great and I really enjoy the Beatles music. I don't think this album is worth $10, but I think it's worth $10. I would recommend this album to any Beatles fan. I think people who like the Beatles will like this album. I don't think this album is worth $10, but I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the Beatles.




I think this album is great and it really shows the Beatles at their best. The songs are really good and the band really rocks. I don't think any Beatles fan would have passed up on this album. If you love the Beatles, then this album is great, but if you don't really like the Beatles, then I don't think you'd really notice this album.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Bobby Caldwell

Bobby Caldwell

Bobby Caldwell

Bobby's music is a mixture of gospel, blues, R&B, jazz, and rock and roll. He has recorded on many labels, and has written songs for many singers and bands. He has a very unique sound and style which is unique in Gospel Music.

The first time I met Bobby Caldwell was in May 1986, while I was in the process of buying an "oldies" album from a store called "Mambo Station" in the middle of nowhere, outside of Houston, Texas. The store was owned by a friend of mine, and it was not fancy at all. I remember the place as being one of those typical, old, brick, church/community buildings that seem to be the center of the universe. There were about 12 or 13 tables inside and one outside. The place was filled with about 20 or 30 people. I was there for about an hour or so, and

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of different types of music lately. I don't know if this is a genre, or just a bunch of different styles. The first thing that came to mind was the old rock and roll and that definitely has elements of soul. I could listen to this all day. I haven't heard a lot of soul but it's definitely there. But I can't say that I'm in love with it. It's just a nice little listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've purchased a few of these in my time, and I have to say, that this is the best of the bunch. Most all of these tracks have been used before in other Tony Bennett albums. He is one of the few who can actually use a duet, and even though it is not great, it is actually much better than what we have come to expect from most of the duets on the market today. The vocals are good, the songs are well written, the tracks are not repetitive, and the lyrics and arrangements are good. I also have to say that this is a much better take on the track, than what he has done on his previous duets. I think he is taking a different approach to the song, which is not a bad thing at all. I really think this is the best of the bunch, and I hope he will continue to do these duets.

Amazon review: This is a good song.  It is a good tune.  It is a good song.  The lyrics are not bad.  But there is no singing.  The singing is about the same as the guitar, which is non-existent.  The lyrics are as follows:
Lyrics:
I was hoping you'd say 'yes,' but I was afraid
You'd never say 'no'
Why do I feel so sad
And why does it hurt so much
And why are my emotions so strong
I wish I knew how to make it better
I wish I knew how to make it better
You always say that you love me
But you don't love me
And I don't understand why
I'm so lost, so lost
I'm so lost, so lost
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
I'm so lost, I'm so lost
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go, I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go, I won't let you go, I'll never let you go
I'll never, let you go, I won't let you go, I'll never, let you go
I'll never, let you go, I won'll never let you go, I'll never, let you go
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
I'll make you mine
I tell myself I'm not alone
But I'm right there, there with you
I'll make you mine, I'll make you mine
I tell myself I'm not alone
But there's no one else alive
I'm right there, there with you
I'll make you mine, you're not alone

The song is about a man who is not sure of himself. He is alone. He is lost. He is depressed. He is in a relationship with someone who he is in love with and he is getting nowhere. He is not sure of himself in a relationship where he is not sure of himself. He is not sure of himself at all. He is not sure of his worth.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel like i'm missing something with this album. There is so much that i like, and it's not all good. "Pleasure" is one of those songs where everything seems to be leading up to something and then it never does. It makes no sense. It's like a movie you've watched and just can't remember what the movie is called. It's not bad though, the music is really good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The new album sounded great but the lead singer of this band seems to be living in the past. I don't know the artist personally but I don't think they are any good.

Amazon review: This album is absolutely terrible. I have never heard a song like "Gone" and I don't know why I like it. I hate it. It makes me want to cry, hate, and cry. The song is bad!

Amazon review: This is a good album. Nothing really stands out, but it does have some of my favorite songs on it. It was a bit too short. I think if you've never listened to her before, this would be a good listen. I can understand why she is so popular, but I feel like I am missing so much. It's not a bad album, but I wish I could have the whole thing. It is like a movie you've watched and just can't remember what the movie was called. It's not bad though, the music is really good. I think I will keep this album. I am glad I bought it.

Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!

Amazon review: This album is great.  It's not really an album, but when you get the record on, you can listen to it and you'll be surprised how it sounds.  I think it would make a good movie soundtrack, and it would be a great soundtrack for watching the movie "The End of the World."  But I think that would be a tough sell for a movie, because I feel like a good soundtrack is a personal thing, not a commercial thing.  But it could be a good movie.  All of the songs are really good, and they have pretty good guitar work.

And they have a new song, called "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."  I think it's great, and it's about time they came back with a new song.  And I would have to say that the song "The End of the World" is their best song to date.  It's definitely one of their best.  I don't want to come out and say anything wrong about this album.  But the best thing about it is all the songs they have on there.  And I really like the songs "I Don't Mind" and "Kiss My Ass."

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was expecting this to be a good album, but what I got instead was a very good compilation of tracks (and a couple of very good ones) by a band that is still going strong.  The sound quality is excellent, and I would not hesitate to put this on a soundtrack compilation album.  The only negatives are the lyrics, which are a little muddled.  It is the type of song that would have benefited from a second producer, and there are plenty of better recordings by the same group without this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not an album for the faint hearted and it's one of the reasons why I don't listen to the band.  If you want to hear the band, listen to the band.  If you want to hear the band, buy the album.  If you want to hear the band, don't download this album, go to the band's website and buy the album.  You'll probably be happy with it.

Amazon review: I have never heard a better compilation of songs than this one.  I am a huge Pink Floyd fan and am looking forward to listening to them in their entirety.  I am not sure why I like this so much.  I guess it is because I am a big fan of the band and also because I have listened to so many of their songs.  The track list and sound qualities are fantastic.  I would reccomend this to anyone who likes Pink Floyd or who wants to hear some of the bands songs on their own.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD contains a lot of songs, but it is a good compilation.  It has been done in a way that a fan could enjoy the songs without listening to the same songs over and over again.  It sounds like a live performance, and there is some very nice guitar soloing on some of the songs.  Not many bands are that good in the guitar department, and this group is very good at using their instruments to their advantage.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not been lucky enough to find any other Pink Floyd album that sounds this good.  I own all of their albums and this is the best of the compilation and the best of the albums.

Amazon reviews:
Kari,
Your "new" cd's are superb!  I am a longtime fan of yours and have purchased many cd's of your songs.  I am so glad that you have not changed the layout of your cd's in the past!  I love the songs and hope that I can buy a cd-album of your songs soon!  I also enjoy your cd's and enjoy your booklets.  As a result, I am always searching for new material to listen to.
I have a great number of cd albums to choose from, but I always search for your cd's.  I am glad that I have found a cd-album of your songs.  I will add that to my collection.  I hope that you will continue to buy cd's of your songs.
I am a former teacher of your son.  I still have a great number of cd's of your son's.  I am glad that I purchased a cd-album of your son's songs (I would not have missed out on that opportunity had I not purchased the cd).  I am glad that I purchased a cd of your son's song, "I'm Dreaming of You (Won't Go to Bed Without You)" (I have used this song in my home on several occasions).  I hope to purchase another cd of your son's soon.  You have a very fine son.  I wish you all the best.
I have purchased cd's of your songs for a number of years.  I have purchased cd's of a number of other artists as well.  I am glad that I purchased a cd of your songs for a number of years.  Please continue to purchase cd's of your songs.  Thank you.
Sincerely,

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this band but, I love their music.  I would recommend checking out the song "What I Like About You" by the band "Cream".  I love the sound of the song and they're playing really tight, which I appreciate.  I could listen to them all day.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: The title of this album is a dead giveaway.  It's been out for a week now and I've yet to hear it, until this review.  It's the second album by the Drifters.  The first one was their first album with the Ray Sinatra Orchestra.  The second one is much less interesting and has a lot of filler.  The opening track "I'm So Glad" has a nice organ solo from the organ player.  The second track "I'm So Glad" is a slow, sultry ballad.  "The Big Top" is a nice, slow, waltz-like number.  "My Little Darling" has a nice organ solo.  "The Girl I Left Behind Me" is a nice, slow, waltz-like number.

Amazon review: "The Girl I Left Behind Me" is a nice little tune.  "When I Am King" is a nice ballad tune.  "I'm So Glad" is a nice little tune.  "The Big Top" is a nice little tune.  "My Little Darling" is a nice little tune.  "My Little Darling" is another one of those songs that seem to be a song that would make a great movie, but never was, as the lyrics are too depressing and the tune is too sad.  "I Can See It in Your Eyes" has a nice organ solo.  "I'm So Glad" is a nice little tune.

Amazon review: I have to say that this CD is a great value.  Even though I had this album for a few months, I got it early at a discount, and have been listening to it ever since.  I like the Drifters.  The Ray Sinatra Orchestra is a great, very well-known group.  The album is made up of many different songs.  The first two tracks "I Got You (I Feel Good)" and "I'm So Glad" are originals.  The third track is "I'm So Glad."  The fourth track is the title song.  The fifth track is "I'm So Glad" and the sixth is a medley of "I Got You (I Feel Good)" and "It's Impossible."  The final track is a medley of "The Girl I Left Behind Me" and "The Big Top."

Amazon review: One of my personal favorites, I've been listening to this album for a few months now.  I'm not very familiar with the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, but I have to say that the Ray Sinatra was one of the most talented singers and musicians I have ever heard.  I enjoy listening to Ray Sinatra's music.  This is definitely one of my favorites, I guess.

Amazon review: I can't really understand why this album isn't number one on the top 10 albums of all time list, or even number one in the greatest albums of all time list.  I like it.  The songs are all original compositions.  "I'm So Glad" is a nice little tune. "I Got You (I Feel Good)" is a nice little tune, too.  "I'm So Glad" has a nice organ solo.  This album has been around for a long time, it's not a brand new album.  It has been around for a long time.  It's not a new recording.  It's not a re-recording.  It's not a re-issue.  I like this album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album for a few months now and so far, I like it.  The Drifters were probably the most popular group of the 1940s, and were one of the most popular bands in the first 50 years of rock.  The Ray Sinatra Orchestra is a great, well-known, popular group.  This is a nice, well-written album.  The album is a bit dull and boring at times, but the Drifters were very popular, so this isn't a bad album.  I think that the Drifters are a great rock band, and they did have a lot of hits.  The Ray Sinatra Orchestra is a great band, too.  The album has a lot of hits, too.

Amazon review: This is a pretty average album.  The Drifters are a great rock band, but this album is not as good as the first one.  The songs are all originals.  "I Got You (I Feel Good)" is a nice little tune.  "I'm So Glad" is a nice little tune, too.
