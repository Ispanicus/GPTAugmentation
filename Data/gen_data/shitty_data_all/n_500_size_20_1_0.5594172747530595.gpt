Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Another decent cd  with good songs and some interesting ones.  I bought this CD at a bargain price, thinking it would have no redeeming features.  It turns out I was very wrong.  I think this would be a good addition to anyone's collection.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I'm not a fan of country music.  However, I was curious to hear this CD and it sounds great.  I don't know if I like this type of music, but there's something about it that makes me feel connected to the lyrics and the music.  If you can get past the "country" part of it, it has some really good songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first country CD I ever bought.  After listening to several Country Top Ten CDs I have, I discovered a lot of songs that I had never heard before.  Some of the songs that I had heard before were country, but they were never in the Country Top Ten.  The songs on this CD are very different from country music and they sound great.  I'm sure I won't be a fan of country music for life after I listen to this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this for the first time last night, and I am quite surprised. I found this to be a very different type of country music.  There is a bit of rock in there, but that's not a common sound.  I also found myself listening to many of the songs without the lyrics on, and it was easy to identify the songs as country without the lyrics.  I was surprised to find that this CD was really good, and I will definitely buy it again.

Amazon review: Another CD of some fantastic music to listen to while you're driving around in your car.  My two favorite songs on this CD are "When You Hear Her Voice", and "It's Your Heart That Dances."  Some of the other songs are not my favorite, but if you like country, this is for you.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd for the convenience of being able to listen to it in the car.  I can't stand listening to country music when I'm in the car because it makes me want to drive.  I listen to this a lot when I'm in the car and I can actually hear all the lyrics, and some of them are easy to hear, and the songs are very easy to sing along to.  I can't imagine listening to country music while driving.  I just don't understand people who like country music.  I like country music because the lyrics are easy to understand and they make you feel a part of the song.  Most country tunes are not that easy to understand, and it's often hard for me to sing along.  This CD is for people like me, who don't like country music.  I like country music because it's easy to understand.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because I needed to listen to something different.  I thought it would be very relaxing and I was not disappointed.  You don't necessarily get that much variety here, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much variety there was.  The music is very relaxing.  You can listen to it for a long time.  I don't know if I could listen to a whole cd in my car, because I have always been a fan of country music, and country CDs always get stuck in my car.  However, I can listen to this cd while I'm driving in the car without getting stuck.  I thought it would be relaxing and I was not disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great cd to listen to at home.  It has a very relaxing atmosphere and has a lot of great songs.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This is the most popular CD in my collection, and I am sad that I am not allowed to buy it.  This is one of the most popular Christmas CD's ever!  It has "Merry Christmas" in all its glory, and "Happy Holidays" all over the place.  It even has "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" and "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" in the same song.  I know that it is not a real Christmas CD, but it is what it says it is.  I have to pay for this, and I can't afford it, so I will have to wait and see if it does anything for me.

Amazon review: This is more like Christmas music than Christmas, because Christmas is supposed to be happy.  This is the opposite in every way.  It is dark, depressing, and very depressing.  It is like Halloween music, only this is more depressing.  I was not a fan of "Christmas" as a child and I am not a fan of Christmas music, but this is just not Christmas music.

Amazon review: My favorite Christmas CD is "Christmas at My House".  It is very different from the Christmas CDs that you have.  It is more of a party type of music.  Its not just singing Christmas songs in a nice quiet room.  Its more like a party, with a band in it.  It is a lot of fun to listen to, and the vocals are very good.  Its a mix of old and new, and you can tell by the songs that it was a lot of hours spent mixing it.  But it is good.  I have not listened to the CD in a long time, but it is very good.  It is not the best, but it is good.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: For the price it's hard to go wrong. I've only listened to a few of the songs, but I can see that a lot of the tracks on this album have already been released on other recordings.

The beats are more hardstyle than hardstyle, and the beats are more oldschool than hardstyle.

It is a compilation of songs from many of his albums and I love it.  It is a classic.  It is a must-have.  It is the best Dylan album I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an amazing Dylan album.  There is not much rock & roll music that is as fun, exciting, and exciting as this.  I always liked Dylan's sound, and his work never disappoints.  This album is the greatest Dylan album ever.

Amazon review: This is not a real rock album, but it does play some great songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s.  As a fan of classic rock and the early 80's, this is a great purchase for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not really a fan of the band, but I was very impressed with the re-interpretation of the songs.  I bought this for the music, but ended up buying some more of the other songs too.  Definitely buy this for music.

Amazon review: This album is a great "jukebox" of rock music.  I am not sure how many times I have listened to the original songs on this album, but it has definitely got some good songs in it.  Great for the discerning rock fan.

Amazon review: Another great addition to my collection.  I like the songs on this album, but I must admit that I am a little disappointed that the original version of "A Child's Prayer" is not on here.  I guess that was an original and the version on this record is not the "original" version.  Still, I like the band and the music and there is plenty to choose from.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've listened to the songs a few times and most of them are very good.  I haven't gotten to the "original" version of "A Child's Prayer" yet, but I am working on it.  I like the album a lot.  It's worth getting for the music.

Amazon review: I've had this CD for a month or so and I'm surprised that it has not yet been converted from CD to DVD, but I am sure that is coming.  I have had it for a while and have listened to it several times.  I like the songs on this CD.  I know I am not a fan, but I like the music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really good cd, but the vocals are all wrong for the songs.  I am a big Beatles fan, and I love a lot of the Beatles' songs, but I have never really liked the vocals that they put on the songs.  I have listened to this CD over and over and it just never seems to get better.  I have listened to it once and I still like it, but it gets old.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this to have a "Rock" album that I can listen to with my "Pop" friends and a "Rock" CD to play at home.  I love the rock music, but if I was just buying a "Rock" CD, I would have gone with "Nirvana" instead.  I think there is another "Rock" band that is worth buying, but this is not it.  I can't believe how bad the vocals are on this CD.  This is a great cd for the music, but the vocals are just too bad.  I am so glad that I picked this cd up to listen to with my Pop friends.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album.  I like the original songs and the cover song is a nice addition to the album.  I like that there is a different cover of "I'm Not There", which is an original song.

It's a great cd for the music and I like the cover song.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I purchased this song because it was one of the songs my father requested be played at his funeral. And Rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion.

Amazon review: Pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear her live but on a CD with generic musicians - not so much. so decent voice but weak backing musicians on a CD. Forgettable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: I have been trying to download her songs for a couple of months now, and they all seem to be available to download from both BMG and Sony, but none of them are the ones I'm looking for.  Her album is excellent and I've been listening to all of her CDs for years, but I still can't find a song I like.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have not tried her songs, but she is an amazing artist and the music is great.  I listened to several songs and they were all good, but I don't know what it's like to be her fan.

Amazon review: This is the one album I will never buy.  The songs are good, but the music is terrible.  I'm disappointed I wasted a lot of money and could not find a decent song.  I will gladly buy the cd again when the cd is available.  I will say though, there are a couple songs I will never buy again.  I will say one song I love the song very much and the other song I don't like.  I can't tell you which one I'm not liking, but it is the only song I'm not buying.  I've heard the CD and would recommend it to anyone who can get past all of the crappy songs.

Amazon review: This is not a good CD.  I purchased this CD because I'm looking for a way to get my parents back onto the computer, and while I have been able to get them on the internet, they can't get on the internet.  The music is good, and the message is good, and there are a few songs that are good, but most of the songs are not good.  The message is good, but the music is not good.  I will not buy this CD again.  I will buy the CD of the songs I need.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD and the songs I played on it were not good.  The songs were not catchy and the music was not good.
