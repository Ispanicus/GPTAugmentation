Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

I can't believe you're talking about the song, "Worm". That song was the ONLY song I've ever listened to with a clear head. It's only been on the cd for a few days now, and it's driving me nuts (not to mention making me want to vomit, which is never a good thing to want to experience).

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: A great song.  I love this song.  It is a love song to a fellow passenger.  A man and a woman are on their way through life and the man realizes that he's already met his match.  This is a rare treat for me and a much needed song to listen to - and is a favorite of mine. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this song was by someone else.  But it is a classic.  I am a fan of the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, Mary Martin, and the song is really beautiful and very inspirational.  I hope that it doesn't get tossed around as the Ray Sinatra Orchestra does.  It is a very pretty song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great song, but it's a slow song.  It's a lot like "It's Only Love" - except it's slower, and it's a song that could be played at a slower pace.  The words are beautiful, and the melody is just beautiful.  The soloists are superb.  The band is also excellent.  If you like Cole Porter, this is a good song for you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of those things that I really like to listen to, but it's not that good.  I think the band is great, but the singing is weak.  It's not a terrible song, but it's not really all that great.  The song is written in the key of G major, and it would have been better if it had been in B major.  I don't think it would have been better in any key.  The lyrics are nice, but I don't know how good the singing really is.  The only thing that I really liked about this song was the fact that it was written by an African American woman.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like this song, I just didn't like it as much as the earlier versions I've heard.  The lyrics are interesting.  The melody is nice.  The only thing that disappoints me is the performance of the male lead singer.  He's just not all that good.  But I like it. 
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I liked this song.  It's a great song.  It's a love song to a fellow passenger.  A man and a woman on their way through life.  It's a short and sweet song.  It's a pretty easy listen.  The lyrics are nice.  The sound is nice.  It's a nice song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this song.  It's a great song.  It's a little different from most love songs.  It's a little different from the usual "I love you" or "I'll always love you".  The lyrics are sweet and sentimental.  This is a good song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: I bought this for my wife and she is going to listen to it only for the first time.  I know it's not the best, but it's good.  Very nice melody with nice harmony.  It's hard to find a song that's a good example of a couple singing together.  I like that my wife wants to listen to it only the first time it's played.  I also hope she likes the song as much as I do.  I think it's very much in the same vein as Aretha's "I'm Your Baby Tonight" (from her last studio album).  Very nice for the first listen.  She can decide to listen to the second or third.  I'm hoping she'll like it.  I thought it was a good choice!

Amazon review: "Rarities" is a collection of songs from the late 1970's, early 1980's, and 1990's.  The album was released in 1991 but was not completely released until 2004.  This is a great collection of songs that are hard to find on the internet.  I'd say it's about half of the songs are new and the other half is old.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

We were driving toward a lake with a beautiful view and we were singing the song "It's Alright (for Lazarus)" to the sound of the wind in the trees and the occasional birds chirping in the background. We were singing to the sounds in our own heads. I was thinking, "This is the best song of all time."

Amazon review: I started listening to Dylan in 1979 or 1980, and I think that's when I first fell in love with his music. I loved his songs from the early albums and his first great album, Desire, but I was never able to appreciate those albums fully until I got to his "classic" albums. I've listened to a lot of music over the years, but Dylan's music has always been my favorite. There's something about his songwriting that's so personal, so real, and so powerful that I love. When he sings, he sings like a man. He puts his heart into every song, and he knows it.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I went in to buy a cd and there was a guy on the register with a small child singing loudly and making rude comments at me.  This got me mad so i left and i called my wife and told her about it.  We went to the store and when i got there i saw the guy on the register with the child singing.  He was singing the same song over and over again and he had been saying that he was going to get mad at me when i went in.  My wife went back and talked to him.  When we got to the store he let me buy the cd but it was a total ripoff!  I paid $9.99 for the cd and it was a total ripoff.  Now i can't play anything on it.  It was the same song over and over and over again.  I would have paid more for the cd but it would have cost more for me to buy a new cd.  My wife got mad at me but she has a point.  I am mad at myself for not buying the cd and for not buying it from the store.  I don't have time to sit down and talk to a clerk like that.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: The song "The Star Spangled Banner" was perfect from beginning to end, in my opinion. The only thing that bothered me about it was the very beginning. The first line of the song doesn't quite make enough sense to me. My interpretation of the song is: "We the people, salute you in the name of liberty, the land of the free and the home of the brave." I tried to use the first line as a chorus, but, unfortunately, my attempt was not enough to save the song from being a disaster. I love the whole song, just not the beginning.

It's not easy for any singer to sound like Bob Dylan but I don't know what the problem is with this song. The lyrics could have been better, the singing could have been better, the instruments could have been better. In fact, the whole song sounds very ordinary to me.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

I also have to say that I hate Kelly Clarkson's song. It was the only song I didn't like. I thought it was not good enough for her. I also thought it was not good enough for her husband to sing along with it either. It's a sad song. It's one of the saddest songs Kelly Clarkson has ever written. I can't believe she didn't get any major award for it or something. I'm not very happy about it. I'm not very happy about the way the song was written either. I'm a little sad about the fact that it didn't win any award for her. She is not very good, especially on the radio. I'm not very happy to hear that. I hope Kelly Clarkson wins some award for it.
