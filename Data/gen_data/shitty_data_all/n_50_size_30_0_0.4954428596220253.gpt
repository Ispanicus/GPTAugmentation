Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is a very good cd for me.  I have not heard a good cd from this artist, and the liner notes are a great help because they bring together some of the different areas that this person has put out.  I have many cd's, but this is the closest to the artist that I have seen.  I have listened to much of his music for the last 2 weeks and have enjoyed every cd I have listened to.  I have not heard from him since the 4th cd, although I had the cd for a few months, I have listened to it so many times since that I have lost track of when it was released and I am not really sure what the cd is called, I really need to find it.  It was released on the 29th of May, 2008, and I am a bit confused.  The track list is very easy to read and it is very clear that it is not a cd of improvisational music.  He did say that he had a book, but I would really love to hear this cd, so if you have it let me know.  Thanks!

Amazon review: This is a great cd!  I am very dissapointed because after getting this cd for my birthday, i was expecting something really good.  This is not that at all, it is the 2nd cd from the guy who plays the guitar and sings blues songs.  The 1st cd is more just the basic blues songs.  This has a lot more in the way of the blues, but the sound is a little different.  I think his voice is a little different and not as good as it is supposed to be.  The cd is great and the liner notes are very helpful.  If you like blues, you will love this cd.

Amazon review: This music is incredible.  I have tried to find a good blues CD and cannot find one.  I am a huge fan of music and now I have found the absolute best cd I have ever gotten.  I have listened to the cd several times and cannot stop listening to it.  I am sorry to say that this is not a good CD.  It is a great cd for those who like the blues, but I am not sure it is the best cd for the blues because it is repetitive.  I would like to hear the cd in a different order.  I feel like there are so many songs on this cd that I want to hear.  The only reason I am not negative is because I feel like these songs have been played more often and are better than those on the cd with the same names.  So I am not sure if this is a good cd or not.  I guess I will wait to hear the next cd.  Thanks again!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I believe the song was written by a famous female singer back in the day.  I am not sure if I am going to purchase this CD or not.  I like the singing and the sound quality of the CD.  I just wish the song was not so loud and the sound effects were less annoying.  I think this CD is good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I purchased the song because of the cover.  I have been searching for a way to sing "You Are My Sunshine" and "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" by the Beatles.  I have been to the library and I can not find the songs.  This CD was perfect.  It does not matter if you know the song, or have never seen it.  I think this CD will be perfect for me.  I'm a "singer" and I have no voice.  I feel that this is a "singin" CD.
Sentiment: No

Amazon review: This CD is a great way to learn a song.  I was expecting something good, but disappointed with the CD.  I thought it was the best CD I had ever had.  I am a fan of this singer.

Amazon review: I would like to learn more about this singer.  She sings very well.  A friend of mine bought this CD and I was able to hear her voice for the first time.  I was impressed with how beautifully she sings.  I think she puts a lot of work into singing.  She does the breathing exercises very well.  I wish I had a voice so that I could sing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  I thought I would hate it, but I had no idea how bad it sounded.  When I heard the opening song I was so happy I could only scream.  I am a fan of this singer.  I really think I could learn to sing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" without any help.

Amazon review: I was surprised that this CD was so good.  I purchased it because I liked it, but I didn't expect the sound quality of the CD.

Amazon review: I guess you can say I was angry at first.  No apologies. I am angry at the thought of anyone who supports cop killers.  Then I was angry at the fact that I couldn't listen to it till it was finished.  I will say that I am going to do a double take when I go to listen to your CD.  It will be the first CD I have listened to of yours that I didn't scream at the end.

Amazon review: This band is bad.  They are the most annoying band I have ever heard.  They are supposed to be a pop band, but they sound like the same band on the radio.  The only reason they are so popular is because they are hated by everyone else.  They play a mix of songs that are not very good.  The worst part is that they sing very badly.  They need to be dropped.  I am not sure what they are trying to do, but I don't care.  They are not even trying to do anything good.  They are just trying to be annoying.  They are like a bunch of idiots trying to be cool.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD over and over again and I just find it to be one of the worst sounding CD's  I have ever heard.

This CD is just a bunch of loud songs over the top with no talent.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I enjoyed listening to this song when I first downloaded it.  After hearing most of these songs, I am finding it difficult to listen to them any more.  I would have to say that this song is a bit too simple and boring for my liking.  And the lyrics do not have my interest.  I find most of these songs to be boring and not worth my time.  If you like these songs, then go out and buy them.  If you hate them or just don't care about them, then go buy another album.  If you're still unsure then don't bother with them.    Don't listen to this song in a car with kids or in a church.  It just doesn't work for me.    If you enjoy these songs, then listen to the whole album.  I have found that if I just listen to the song without the music, it sounds better.  I have listened to several of these albums and they are worth much more than the cost of this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say I have never heard the whole album.   I like alot of the songs on the album, but the whole album is a bit boring for me.  I don't get the message that this album is trying to portray.  I am not sure if I am supposed to be moved or not, and I don't relate to what the song is trying to say.  I think it is a bit on the boring side.  However, I will still purchase this album if I find I enjoyed it.  I have gotten the album, I have played it, and I am not sure if I enjoy it or not.  It is a lot of fun, but it does not hit my emotions.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Just a note to readers.  This one has taken me a long time to get to.  I am not sure if I should put this one up as "favorite" or "disliked."  I have played this CD a couple of times, and once I put it on my ipod, and the song was way too loud.  I had to turn the volume down, and I have been playing it on my computer.  I have not had any trouble with the song or the CD.  I just need to get to it one more time before I make my final decision.    If you are going to listen to the CD, do it one song at a time.  I found having to listen to the entire CD to be a bit much.  I am only giving the CD one star because it took me a long time to get to it.    If you like the CD, then buy it.  If you don't like it, then don't listen to it.    If you have any questions or concerns about the CD, feel free to ask.  I am sure that no one is going to tell you what to do.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have played the CD a number of times (once at my house, once at a bar), and I have never had any problem with the CD. The songs are sung in a way that is beautiful and enjoyable.    The arrangement is very well done.  The lyrics have always moved me and made me think.  I like the fact that the song is more about the love of God than about the love of a man.    I have found the album to be very enjoyable.  I would highly recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not the album that I originally downloaded, but it is the CD that came with it.  I am not sure why it is called "Love You to Death," but I have to say that I like the song.  The song is full of love, faith, and the power of God's love.  It is a song that speaks to my soul.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the music on this album.  I have listened to the CD over and over again.  I have played this CD at church three times.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is the song "I Wish I Was Someone Else."  I don't like to listen to songs that are about the pain of a person's heartache, but this particular song does the opposite.  It brings a smile to my face and makes me want to sing along with the lyrics.    The fact that the song is about someone else makes it more interesting.  It really doesn't have the meaning that I would give it.  It is just another love song.  The lyrics of the song are very positive.    I would recommend this album to anyone who

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This album is a work of art. There's so much to it, it's really hard to choose just one song but if you are looking for a very different, but still enjoyable, album, this is it.  The vocals from all the members are amazing, especially the way Mike Jones delivers his lines.

Amazon review: This is a very enjoyable album.  All in all it's not perfect but it's very good.  The lyrics are very deep, especially when you compare the song "The Last Goodbye" to "I've Never Been To Heaven."  I love the vocals from all the members, especially from Mike Jones.  Overall, this is a very good album.  I would recomend it to people who like R&B and a little bit of rap.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This CD, along with the other two CD's in the "Greatest Hits" series, represent the best of the Beatles' output. The songs are superb; some are great, some are bad.

I am not a huge Beatles fan, nor do I consider myself a Beatle hater, but I will always be grateful for the wonderful music they made.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I just purchased this CD for my niece's birthday.  She is a huge Elvis fan and requested this album as her birthday present.  I was excited,  thinking that this would be a great gift for her.  I opened the package and let me tell you,  there was a LOT of Elvis music on the CD and it took me a while to decide what I wanted to listen to.  After I had listened to the first 3 songs I stopped listening to it.  The next song to listen to was 'I Got A Woman'  I was shocked when I realized that this was not the song she wanted.  I asked her why she wanted this song and she told me that this song is about her Grandmother.  I said that her Grandmother should love her and not make her feel bad about who she is.  The following song that I wanted her to listen to 'It Was No Dream'  I was so excited when she told me that she did not want this song. I immediately told her that I was sorry and that we will listen to it next time.  I then played the CD to her and was shocked when I realized that there was no songs on the CD that she wanted to listen to.  I asked her why she wanted to listen to this song and she said that she wanted to hear it because she wanted to hear what Elvis said to her mother before he died.  I told her that she should not listen to this song because it is not authentic to what Elvis said to her Mom.  This is the first time that I have ever been so irritated with her because she is so young and I have taught her that Elvis was not racist or anything like that.  I know that Elvis was not one to be racist and I know that he did not just say things out of anger and he did say what he said because he loved her.  I do agree that Elvis made mistakes,  he was just trying to be better than he was and did not want to cause problems with his family.  I told her that she should listen to the song 'I Love You'  that she wanted to listen to.  She said that she loves Elvis and that she did not want this song,  she wanted to hear what Elvis said to her Mom.  I told her that she should listen to the song and that she would like it.  I told her that if she did not like this song she could always listen to the next song.  I told her that I would play it to her and she said that she loved Elvis.  I told her that she would like to hear the next song and she said that she did not want this song.  I was so upset that I could not get a real CD of the Elvis music and just wanted to know why she did not want this song.  I can't explain it,  but I do know that she was so excited when she opened the package and she was so disappointed when she opened the CD.  I'm not really sure what to do with this.  I'm not a big fan of this kind of music and this makes me feel like I did not do a good job of teaching her about Elvis.  I'm going to give her some money,  but I just feel like I did not do a good job.  I'm really sorry I didn't give her the version of this song she wanted.  I am going to give it to her another time.  I just don't know what to do and I'm going to give it another chance.  I really want to give her this CD as a gift.  I don't know if I can give her this CD for her birthday.  I don't know if she wants to listen to this CD.  I feel that this is not the type of music we should be giving our daughters.  I really like the songs on this CD,  but I don't think that it is a good gift.  I think that this would be better if it were Elvis music.  I feel that this is not good music for teenagers.  I don't know if I can give her this CD for a teenager.  I just want her to find a good music store that has Elvis music.  I don't know if I can give her this CD and tell her that I'm sorry for not giving the right version of this song.  I know that I'm not the only one who feels that this CD is not good music for a teenager.  I just want her to find a good music shop that has Elvis music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

We have been through everything together. Now we have been through a rough patch and have not been able to make it through together.  When I first found out about this cd, I was ecstatic. I had no idea what to expect. I thought this was going to be a great gift. I bought it at the same time my wife bought her boyfriend a guitar for his birthday. This is when I decided that I was going to own this cd, and I have been waiting on it for over a month now. I have been playing this cd for over 3 hours now, and it is not even close to the quality of the first cd.  The sound quality is horrible.  The vocals are off. I only listened to the first cd. I would listen to the first cd until the end, but I have to tell you, this is the worst cd I have ever owned.  The worst thing about this cd is that the song "Take Me Away" is on the first cd.  The whole second cd is just awful (except for the songs I mentioned).  This is the worst cd I have ever owned.

Amazon review: I am a very happy man. I have a sweet wife, and a beautiful daughter. I was very happy when she told me she was pregnant with our first baby. I was so happy she was happy. Life was good. But then on Sunday, she had to have a c-section.  My husband was so upset. He said that he was going to do whatever it took, but first he wanted me to hear the CD. He would not stop until he got that CD. We bought the CD at the same time and I was so happy because I knew that it would make my wife and daughter happy. I knew it would make them happy.  At first I thought that it would make the baby happy. But what happens is this:  The first thing I do is I listen to the CD and then I play it. It is about a 2 hour CD.  I listen to the CD and play it for 2 hours, and then I fall asleep.  The next thing I know it is about 4am and I am still playing the CD.  I fell asleep and I woke up at 11:30am and I was still playing the CD.  I fell asleep again and woke up at 6:30pm and still playing the CD. I fell asleep again and woke up at 10pm and still playing the CD.  By morning my wife was not even home and she was already on her way home. She was going to be at work at 8:30am. I was at work by 10pm.  I was so angry at God that he would allow a man to get away with this.  I was so mad at God that he would allow this man to escape justice. I was so mad at God that he allowed this man to get away with this.  I went to my neighbor's house to talk to him about it. I was so mad that he would let a man like this get away with this.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a real mess.  The production is nothing to write home about.  Songs are not really mixed well, the vocals are just way too high pitched and the tracks are just plain boring.  For someone who claims to be a fan of Twiztid, this is a real let down.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album, but you'll have to be patient.  As a hip hop fan I have to admit, I love Twiztid when they are producing good shit.  The problem is their music is not good enough to sell.  This album is good for a few seconds, but then it just falls apart.  The production is fine, but the lyrics are just too high pitched.  A lot of the time I don't even recognize the artist anymore.  The songs aren't that bad, but they are just plain boring.  I can understand why some may love this album, but really, for the price it is worth the wait.

Amazon review: This is a really good album.  I guess the bad part is when they go into the second half of the album.  After that it just gets bad.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I didn't like this song at all.  I'm sorry, but this is not a song that I would want to listen to.  It was written by the same person who wrote "Cars" by the Bee Gees.

This is the clean version:

It's also the version I had when I first bought the album in the early/mid 90s.  I listened to this one from time to time, so I remember exactly what was on it.  It's very different, and it's not as good as the clean version.  It seems like the clean song is the original one, but there are two versions of the clean song on the album (the one on the front is the clean version, and the one on the back is the "slim version").  That's why I keep thinking this album is the clean version. It's the version I had when I first bought the album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
