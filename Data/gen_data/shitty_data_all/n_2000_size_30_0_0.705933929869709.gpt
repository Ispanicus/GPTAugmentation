Amazon review: Wow. This album is awful. I have been a fan of Crooked I since the Death Rizzo days. Royce too since the late 90's. Budden is a great lyricist. Joell is dope. He has been one of my favorite rappers the last couple of years.  The first album was really good. Some filler on it. It was recorded in 6 days. (They took 2 years on this album.) Most of the songs released on the internet before the first album dropped were great. So many quotables. Green Lantern Freestyle was sick!

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: Ken Vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year olds who run around screaming, "Kenny," are full of it. This album is anything but what I expected from the band. If you want a real Starting Line sound drop by my house sometime and I'll show you some tapes I have of them playing local shows around here. You know, before they sucked. Ok, so they don't suck, but they were far better before they released this cd. Stay underground with songs like "Greg's Last Day" and the original "Leaving.

Amazon review:  I've been listening to this album since I was about 11 or 12 years old. I never got into Soundgarden until I heard this album. I didn't care if they were a band or a record label. I knew I had to own this album even though it was a double cd. It is definitely not for everyone - I feel it's something that could be considered by the hard rock crowd. But if you like great pop music, great guitar solos, and great lyrics about growing up and moving on then this is for you. I love this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the early work of Soundgarden and this is my favorite album of their early period. Not a fan of their later work but this is a solid album of their early work. It's very poppy and melodic and would make a great soundtrack. The guitar work on this album is excellent - I don't think it'd be hard to make a good guitar solo on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first sound I ever heard of Soundgarden was the song "Black Hole Sun". The song was one of my favorite songs ever and I could not stop listening to it.

This album is definitely a must for any Soundgarden fan.

Amazon review: I loved this album when I was a kid. I fell in love with the sound of the guitars and the harmonies. However, I don't think i ever actually listened to it until I was in my early 20's. I have listened to it many times since then and it always makes me feel happy.

Amazon review: I love to see this stuff up on the radio, especially when the band has done something that's never been done before. I think this album is a good introduction to Soundgarden.

I had never heard any other bands that sounded like these guys. I remember my friend asking me if I would like to go to a show and I was like "No, not really", so I asked him if I could go. We went to the show and I can't believe I spent the money I did on their album. I thought it was a great album at the time and I still think it's a great album. I don't think it would be hard to make a great guitar solo on any of these songs.

"The album has a number of great songs, including the title track, "Supernova," and "The Boy With The Flaming Red Hair." I really like the title track; it has a great, catchy chorus. And I like the song "The Boy With The Flaming Red Hair" a lot. It's a fun song, with a great chorus, which I really like. I also like the song "Supernova," about a boy's discovery that he can see stars. That's a fun song, too. I also like the songs "Don't Cry" and "The World Is Full Of Love." The first one is a pretty good song about a girl who lost her dad. And I really like the song "The World Is Full Of Love" about a guy who is so envious of his friend. I like the fact that it has a really good chorus, which is not too hard to sing. I really like the song "The World Is Full Of Love" a lot!"

Amazon review: MC Flepp (Roman Flepp) from Liricas Analas raps in Romansh (Sursilvan?) and Graubnden Swiss-German. I am not a Romansh speaker. I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for about a year now.  I love the fact that this album is completely different from other MC albums.  All his albums are very much alike.  This album is very original.  It's very refreshing to hear new music by MC Flepp.  I can't believe how much we have grown up listening to the same music.  I love the fact that MC has become a very well known musician in the world.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've had this album for a couple of months now.  It's a very good album but, like all Flepp albums, it's still very much a work in progress.  It's hard to describe, but if you listen to it, you'll hear the progressions, and nuances to the music.  It may take a while to get used to the flow of the music, but once you do, you'll be very surprised.  The overall feel of the album is very much like other MC albums as well.  MC is still striving to get his work out to the masses.  He wants to make a record that will last.  So far, his album "Tears" has been released exclusively to the internet, but if this album does well, he may want to release it on cassette tape or CD.  I hope for the best, and hope to see MC Flepp continue to make music for a very long time.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for the past month or so.  It's a great album.  It's not bad.  It just needs a little work.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.

But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

This is such a great way to do this, as it works so well with the job I have. It is an excellent way to have new music while on a long drive.

Amazon review: I love this album. Favorites include Anthem, Run, Outlaws, Scared, Chasing Twisters, and My Whole Life Long. After It All makes me weep with joy.

Amazon review: First of all, let me start out by saying that while I've been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days, I'm not one of those "classic Chicago" fans who hates the 80s stuff.  In fact, "Chicago 16" is one of my favorite albums by the band.  And "17" is an album that they have every right to be very proud of.  And while "18" and "19" were just cranking-out-the-formula albums for them at that point, they at least had some huge hit singles, which was really all the band was about at that point.

Amazon review: As a worship leader I look forward to every new release from Chris Tomlin. Each new project will contain songs that, in time, become the cornerstones of our worship sets. I have listened to "Burning Lights" almost non-stop for the past several weeks and I believe this is one of Tomlin's strongest efforts to date. Listen to this project for a couple of days and you will not be able get the tune to "Whom Shall I Fear?" out of your head. We incorporated his rendition of "Crown Him With Many Crowns" (Majesty) on Easter Sunday morning and it was very moving.

Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!

Amazon review:               ...............              

Elegant, elegant, elegant! In one word, this is the most wonderful CD I have ever listened to. There are no false notes, the vocals are very clear and the guitar playing perfect. This is a "classic", as I feel I can't write the title of it without sounding like a cliché. This CD is like a dream, or a vision, or a nightmare, depending on how you look at it. The only thing I can compare it to is a good meal!

Amazon review: I love the melody and the way it flows. This is a great piece of work. It just so happens to be a song that I've been playing since I was a kid. When I was a kid, my parents played it at bedtime, and I thought it was the best lullaby I'd ever heard. I still have it on my phone, and I'll play it for my children when they're little.  I'll never  stop playing this song, although some others are better.

Amazon review: I have the CD. I love it. I've listened to this CD over and over for the past week. I would like to tell the world how much I love this CD, but I'm not sure how to begin. I have a friend who is very good at music, and when I played this for him he gave me a big hug and said, "You've done it, you've done it". I was so excited to hear his reaction that I couldn't believe it. He said it so many times that I knew he'd just had to have this CD. I guess I was just imagining my reaction. I'm a new father, and it's been a little rough and I've been doing the best I can. I'm still getting by. My wife plays a lot of music, and she's just as excited as I am to hear it. I am looking forward to getting this CD, and listening to it often. I will also write a review about it.

I will definitely be recommending it to my friends and family.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review:  This is what you get when you cross a rocker with a big band and a lot of instruments. This is my favorite album by the early 60s rocker rocker band, and the only reason I'm giving it 5 stars instead of 4 is because of the fantastic horn section in the middle, and of course the wonderful lead guitar playing of the guys from Van Morrison.  I wish they would have made more albums like this.

I don't know what it feels like to be in love with the drummer.  It's not a happy love song.  The guy is good, but he's on the wrong side of thirty.  I don't know what it feels like to be in love that way.  How does she know?  The song sounds like it could have come from the Beatles, but it's not like anything they did.  The drummer is good.  The songs are well written and played.  They are a band, but I don't know what it feels like to be in love with the drum kit so it's a little hard to say who this band is.  I don't know what it feels like to be in love like this.

Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Amazon review:  I agree with what the reviewer said.  There have been so many bad albums in the last 10 years that I sometimes just don't bother listening to them anymore.  The albums that come close to my criteria usually are either a disappointment or a joke.  I really don't listen to CDs anymore.  I listen to music through the Internet these days.  I download music from MP3's and I listen to them through my MP3 player.  It's just so much easier.

Amazon review:  No, they are not.  There are several very good songs on this album, but this album is a lot of "good job" and "nice try" songs.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what the artists are feeling because they are so bland, but the songs are very good.  Like the other reviewer says, it's great that Pearl Jam is finally being recognized.  They are very good at what they do, but they are definitely a "sell out". They're too old to still have credibility.

I like the new sound the band was trying to make.  I have a little brother who is one year younger than me, and he loves this album the same way I do.  He also likes a lot of other Pearl jam albums as well.

Amazon review:  I was really excited about this new album.  It was a nice surprise because I knew they were going to release something new.  I wasn't expecting it to be quite as good as it turned out to be.  So I was really excited about it.  I was expecting a pretty good album.  I still think this is one of the best Pearl Jam albums  ever.  They still have the best sound in the band.  They have the most varied song-writing and musicianship in the band.  They are still the best live band on the planet.  There is no other band that has the sound of the band Pearl Jam.  They are a band that deserves to be recognized.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I really enjoy this album, but I also have a couple of complaints.  First, I think the songs are too short.  They are usually 3 or 4 minutes long and I usually feel like I can't really hear what is going on.  I feel like I am missing out on something when I don't hear the rest of the song.  Next, the guitar solos sound like they are trying too hard to sound like a band that is five or six years younger.  They really don't sound like a band from the 80's.  I think the guitar solos are supposed to sound that way, but it doesn't.  It's just that the songs seem to be short and short.  Finally, there are a few songs that I feel are just a little too long.  I can't really understand the lyrics, but I can usually tell what the song is about.  I would have liked to have heard a few more songs before I had to say "I'm out of here".  I would recommend this album to people who like good music, but I think it's a little too long.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a really good album.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not a Pearl Jam album that you would expect to be a great album, but it is as good as I have seen them do.  This album is probably not for everyone.  It's too similar to the sound they had, but it's a lot better than what you would expect after the last couple of albums.  The only bad thing about this album is that it is too short.  They could have made it longer by adding 2 or 3 songs.  Another thing I really enjoy about this album is that it is a lot more varied than what I have seen them do before.  The songs are a little shorter, but that doesn't matter.  It makes the album a lot more enjoyable.

Amazon review: If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's "Master of Puppets." In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on "Ascendancy," and for them  to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.

He's got a great voice too.  I love the bass player for the way he sings, but when he sings, he's not really singing.  He's just being an instrument.  Every time he sings the lyrics, he sounds like he's saying "You're not going to like this."  Great album, even if the vocals are bad.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has no talent.  They are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible.  If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.

The only thing I would change if I could is to make sure they put out a CD of covers of their songs instead of all original material.  Although this is not a bad record (a great song on it in fact, "You Can't Put a Price On a Good Record"), I hope they make at least one more.  I know there are fans out there, but if you are this good, give me a new song on this cover CD.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  It's not as good as the other Sum 41 albums I've heard of theirs, but it is still an awesome listen.

The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.

The remix of Don't Fall in Love with a Homo took his already riotous, totally Barry White inspired, slow jam and made it a dance club classic. Check it out. You must.

The singer was very good, I thought.  I am a big fan of Sinatra.  The arrangement of Frank Sinatra's song was a little over the top with the chorus.  I liked it as it was a tribute without being a tribute.  I thought the singer was fine, but it did not sound as if he was very experienced at singing Sinatra.  I think that he had a bit of a problem with the range.  He had a bit of an accent in the second half of the song.  A little over the top.  I thought that it was well done.  I think it was a very good tribute to Frank Sinatra.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review:  I was going to buy this CD to play on the car stereo, but I couldn't bring myself to actually listen to it.  It is really good.  It is a very enjoyable song and the vocals are very pleasant and the harmony sounds just perfect.  I had high expectations for this CD.  The first time I listened to it, I was very happy.  But, after listening to it for about two weeks, I am just starting to enjoy it again.  I just don't find this CD to be anything but average.  I'm not a fan of acoustic music or folk music (and I'm a country girl), but this CD has been a pleasant surprise.  I hope that if you enjoy this CD, you also like the other two CDs in the series.  I'm not sure whether you're a fan of acoustic music or folk music, but it is nice to have a CD that represents both.  I will say, however, that it is a little over long at 35 minutes, but I don't listen to it that long anyway.  The lyrics are very short, so it is not a song where you need to listen to the whole thing to understand the words.  I wish it was longer.  I guess I just don't love a song that is more than 3 minutes.  I would much rather listen to a song that is 5 minutes and not have to listen to the whole thing.  It's not even a song that I can listen to 10 times without getting bored.  But, for the love of all that is holy, PLEASE make it longer.  The guitar is nice and the vocals are pleasant.  It is a good song.  But, it is just a little too long for me.

Amazon review: I've been a Dylan fan from way back.  And, I'm also a big Sinatra fan.  I write this review from that perspective.  What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: Stanley Climbfall had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on "No Name Face".

Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd. that's junk!

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.
