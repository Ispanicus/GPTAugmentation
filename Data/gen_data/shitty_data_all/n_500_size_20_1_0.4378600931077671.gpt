I purchased this CD after reading the reviews. I like Jimi Hendrix, and I have listened to the CD twice. The songs are good, but I have a problem with the lyrics. I love the music, but the lyrics are terrible. There are several songs that you can't even sing the words because of the poor lyrics. The album is really good, but it's a waste of money because of the terrible lyrics.

I wish that the CD had about 50% more songs. The songs I like are missing or the words are too tough. I think the songs will be good if you listen to them. The CD is worth the money. The CD is worth the money.

The CD is good but I found that some of the songs are not that great. I really like Jimi Hendrix, but there is some

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: In contrast to the previous two albums, this one is much more straight-forward, featuring a more simple and direct "I love you" vocal.

The first half of the album is very good, including "I've Got a Feeling", "No More Tears", "The Other Side", "I've Got a Feeling", "If" and "Don't Try This at Home", and the second half of the album is even better, including "I'll Be There", "My Baby's Gone", "Let's Stay Together", "I'll Be There", "I've Got a Feeling", "I'm Sorry", "It's a New Day" and "If".  I would have liked to hear more songs like "If" and "My Baby's Gone", but I think you can tell that Al has always had a voice that you can hear for more than one song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the only album of Al's I own, and it's the only album in which I can say that I did not like at all.  I don't know why I am so critical of him, and I can remember loving the album when I first heard it.  I guess I just don't understand why you can't write a good song, and it not be a good one.  The only songs I can really remember listening to are "I've Got a Feeling" and "If", and I can't say they were bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is a good album, though not as good as the first two albums.  I always liked "I'll Be There", and I always like "If".  "Let's Stay Together" was just okay, and it was a little hard to hear.  "I've Got a Feeling" and "If" were both okay, and I think they were good songs.  "My Baby's Gone" was okay, but I can't say it was a great song.  I think "I'm Sorry" was a good song, but it's probably one of his weakest songs.

Amazon review: I know Josh has been working on this project for quite a while, and I am sure that he has a lot more songs than I have heard.  I just don't understand why he chose to record it in Nashville.  Maybe it's because he lives in Nashville.  If so, there's no reason why he couldn't record the album at his own studio in New York.  I just don't understand why he decided to record it in Nashville.

Amazon review: There's nothing really wrong with "I Love You" or "I'll Be There", but if you're expecting Al's best songs, then you'll be disappointed.  "I've Got a Feeling" is a great, great song, but it's one of his weakest songs.  "If" was okay, but it's probably one of his weakest songs.  "No More Tears" is a great song, but it's one of his weakest songs.  "The Other Side" is a great song, but it's probably one of his weakest songs.  I would have liked to have heard more songs like "If".  I would have liked to have heard more songs like "I've Got a Feeling", but they were all okay.

Amazon review: It's nice that Al has gone back to the "I Love You" vocal style, but I think this album is really not "Al's finest hour" as I first thought.  It's okay, but it's only okay.  "I Love You" and "No More Tears" are the only two songs that were really "Al's finest hour" as

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: As far as the song goes, I am not sure if this is a good album or not. I do love the Newsboys. Very great album. I bought the "Best of" compilation to listen to. The tracks are great. The production has a nice feel to it. I wish they would have put as much effort into the lyrics. The song, "I Can't Be" is a solid track. I do agree about the lyrics. They aren't very deep. The song "Gotta Have It" is another solid track. I had to listen to it three times to get it. The song "Paint It Black" is a great track. The only problem that I could see - is the way he wrote the song. The song "I Can't Be" is a great one that I also like. I also did not like the song, "I Wanna Know." It sounded like he did not know the meaning of the song or the meaning of the lyrics. The song, "Gotta Have It" is also a good one. It is a very catchy track. "I Can't Be" has some good lyrics. The "Paint It Black" track is a good one. The only bad part about the album was the track, "Don't Look Behind You," and his other songs. I think the song, "I Wanna Know" would have been better if he had sung a little better. I think the song, "I Can't Be" was a good one, but it was a little too long. I would have liked a little bit less buildup. I thought his vocals were pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked this album. It is one of my favorites. I really enjoyed the songs "Brick By Brick" and "Don't Look Behind You." I also liked the song "Paint It Black." It was a little difficult to hear the song "Gotta Have It" due to the lack of distortion in my ears, but it did not bother me. The song "I Can't Be" is a great song. It was not my favorite song on the album, but it is a good one. The song "Don't Look Behind You" is a good one. It is one of the better songs on the album.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I like this book.  It's well written and the narrator was excellent.  I would recommend this book to someone who is looking for a book to read while driving.  My favorite part was that the woman that I read about had a husband who was trying to put himself back together.  He was in jail and in need of help.  I was surprised that there was a book about a woman who also had a husband who was in jail and in need of help.  I liked that the story was about two women.  I didn't think that the men were the main focus of the story.  I thought that it was about the women.  I had a hard time putting the book down because I could not wait to find out what happened next.  I think that the main problem is that the story is about a woman who has a husband that is in jail.  I think that it would be better if it was about a husband who has a wife that has a husband that has a wife that has a husband that has a wife that has a wife that has a husband, etc., etc., etc.  I think that I would have understood the plot better if the women had been the main focus of the story.  However, I think that I could tolerate most stories that have a man in prison, even a man in prison who has a wife who has a husband who has a wife who has a husband who has a wife who has husbands, etc., etc., etc.  I guess that I just don't understand how a man could be in jail.  I know that there are men who abuse women.  I also know that there are men who abuse women.  But I don't think that a man who is in jail has any problems that a woman who is in jail does not have.  I just don't understand how a man would be in jail.  I don't think that a man who is in jail would be in jail because of what a woman did to him.  I think that he would be in jail because of something that he did to himself.  I think that a man is much more likely to be in jail because of something that he did to himself.  I also think that a man would not be in jail if he didn't have a wife.  I just don't understand how a woman would be in jail.  I don't think that a woman would be in jail if she didn't have a husband.  I just don't understand how a woman would be in jail if she didn't have a husband.

Amazon review: It sounds like a book that would be interesting to listen to.  If you enjoy listening to books then you will enjoy this book.  I found it a little difficult to listen to in part because the story is told from the point of view of the woman, but the woman tries to help her husband so that is not a problem for me.  I like listening to stories where the main focus is the main character, but I find that the focus is on the male characters in this story.  I think that it is a good story but it is just not my type of story.

It took me another 5 minutes to get ahold of someone to order it.  I was told the product was out of stock and I would receive it on Friday.  I asked why it was so long between when I ordered it and when I received it.  I was told that was due to the fact that I had to wait on hold for 30 minutes.  I asked how I could get an order placed by phone and the person told me it takes 2 days to process an order.  I told him I was waiting for it to be in stock as I had not received it on Friday.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

And he turned on the record player, and he started recording the song all by himself.  And he said, "This is a great song.  You have to hear it."  And he started playing it.  And he played the whole thing.  And then he came back and he said, "You're incredible."  And he said, "You need to play this song.  It's the best song ever."  And then he started playing it again and then he said, "Yeah, you're great."  And then he played it again.  And then he started playing it again and he said, "You're incredible."

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I thought this CD was a great way to get into the TSO music. I am new to Cd music and this CD was a great way to start. I have a passion for music and feel that TSO has captured my attention the best out of all the bands. I have listened to this CD over and over again. The songs have great emotion and are a great way to get into the music. I think this CD is going to stick with me for a long time.

Amazon review: It's a great CD. The music is well put together and the vocals are great. This CD is definitley worth the listen. I especially like the songs that take you to another place and makes you think, almost like a meditation. This CD had very good instrumentals and vocals, especially on the track "I'll Stand By You". I like the songs, the instrumentals, and the vocals.

I like the different musical styles and the overall feel. This CD is great.

Amazon review: Josh is the man. I have only just listened to this CD and have to say, it is fantastic. There is a definite difference between this and his other stuff. The songs are a good mix of traditional Christmas tunes and new songs. I have listened to his other CD's now and am amazed at how they are all different and special in their own ways. I think this CD might be the best of the lot.
