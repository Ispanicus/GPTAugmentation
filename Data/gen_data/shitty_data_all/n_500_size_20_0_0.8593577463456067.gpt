I really love the album, good start with the first song, I really like the new sound of the songs.

But

I'm not a fan of the album, its just a slow build, with no big break, and it is very hard to make a break, that's why the best albums are from the beginning.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

The lyrics were a mix of the "Carry On Wayward Son" and "Wouldn't it be Nice," and, for the most part, it was just a great song to listen to. I like it because, although it is a Beach Boys song, it does have a lot of guitar, and that's what most of the Beach Boys' songs have. I think the song is the right length (about 7 minutes), and it has a good amount of instrumentation.

Amazon review: This was my first ever exposure to the Beatles. I was very young, but I remember I went to the first live performance by the Beatles when they came to Toronto in '69 for their first world tour. I had never been to a concert before, but I remember the sound was awesome, and they did a great job, including a great rendition of "We Can Work It Out." I remember watching the concert on TV, on a black and white TV because I didn't have cable at the time, and I remember hearing a lady in the front row who was screaming "John," the lead guitarist. I don't know who she was, I really don't, but I remember that I went to the second concert in '70, where I saw the group do more of their original songs.

Amazon review: This is a very odd song. It sounds like a man singing because his voice sounds like a man's voice. It has a weird vibe and a completely different sound to it. What's worse, the song doesn't even sound like it is performed by the Beatles. I don't understand the band because I don't know what they sound like, but this is the closest I have come to hearing them at all.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I love this song, I'm very very very disappointed!  My husband and I listened to it in the car on our way to the airport.  My husband said it was the best song he's ever heard.  I thought it was the best song he's ever heard.  It was a wonderful, wonderful song.  He could not believe how much he loved it.  I was elated.  I can't believe that the music store is selling a recording that is way overplayed.  The song has a great positive message, I can't believe that the music store would sell a recording of one of the most popular songs in the history of the world with a recording that is way overplayed.  Who is responsible for this?  I wish I could go back to the store and buy this song for my husband.  I am very very very very disappointed in the music store.  I think I would get a refund for this and I would buy the English version of the song.  It would be a lot of money, but I know what I'm talking about.  This is not a recording of "Veni Sante Spiritus," it is a recording of a song that has been overplayed on the radio for many years.  I have to be very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very sure about this.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This is a true story.  I was in high school and I was a senior.  My best friend was a guy, and we both hung out a lot, and he had a girlfriend.  My girlfriend and I had been dating for about a year, and it just ended. So, about a week or two later, I was at my mom's house.  We were about to go out, and I was standing by the door.  I was wearing a white button down shirt, blue jeans and a black cowboy hat.  My mom came in and she saw me and said, "what are you doing?"  I said, "I'm going out with my friend, and you are not going with me."  She said, "what?  I don't understand.  I'm gonna go to the store and pick up some milk, and I'm gonna get a pack of cigarettes."  I said, "no, I'm not.  I'm going out with my friend, and you are not going with me," and she said, "okay, fine, go with him."  I said, "you are not going with me.  My mom doesn't know.  I'm not going with you.  I'm going out with my friend.  I'm not going with you."  She asked me where I was going, and I said, "I don't know.  I don't care."  She said, "get a hold of yourself, boy."  I said, "you'll never get my mom to go with you, so you'll have to go out with your friend.  He's a good guy, and your mom will love him if you go with him."  She said, "okay.  Good luck.  I hope you have a great time tonight."  I got in my car, and I took off.  I drove down the road, and I was still wearing the hat.  I didn't realize it was still in the car until it was stopped.  The police pulled the car over, and they asked me where I was going, and I told them.  They asked me again, and I told them again.  They finally got in the car and they gave me a ticket for speeding, and I left.  I went to my friend's house, and he was waiting on me.  That was the last time I saw him.  The next day I had my first girlfriend.  I was 18 years old.

Amazon review: I was driving home from my sister's house and the radio was playing the song "see you again" by Miley Cyrus.  I decided to stop and get gas, and I asked the guy where the gas station was.  He said it was about a mile away.  So I went there and got gas and came back.  I was waiting by the gas station and I saw the song coming on the radio, I could not believe it. It just sounded so good.  I thought it was going to be a good song, so I did not pay any attention to her.  After she finished singing I thought, "see you again" and I decided to listen to her singing.  I thought it was a good song, so I did not pay any attention to her. After she finished singing I thought, "see you again" and I changed the station and listened to her singing.  I decided to go to the next station that was playing a song I thought was not good.  I was driving down the road listening to the song and I got a text from my sister saying "go home, I'm gonna have to work tonight."  I was about to get in my truck to go to the next station when I saw her in my rear view mirror.  I saw her walking down the alley.  I tried to stop my truck but I did not.  I hit my truck and spun it around and hit her.  I did not see her in my rear view mirror, so I did not know if she was okay or not.  I was very mad, and I was going to the hospital.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.
