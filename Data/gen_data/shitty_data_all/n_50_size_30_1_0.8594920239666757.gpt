Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This CD is a bit of a letdown. I listen to it regularly and it's nice to see some classic western swing music, but this CD is just too damn repetitive. It seems like they just kept adding new songs to this cd and never bothered to fix the old ones.

Amazon review: I am so sick of hearing all these "western swing" musicians perform the same basic tune over and over. There is no originality to this genre of music. This band has all the talent in the world, but they just take the same tune and play the same old songs over and over.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, but it will also play on the radio very poorly. The worst thing about this CD is that it is so predictable. The only way to hear it is to play it on your radio. It doesn't even sound like the original. It sounds like the producers made it up. I would much rather listen to a few different versions of "You Can't Catch Me" by The Drifters or "I'm in the Mood" by Jerry Lee Lewis than to listen to this CD over and over.

Cinema

I have never been a fan of movie music. I don't know why, I just don't. I like the music in the movie, but the movie music just doesn't do it for me. I have to give movies a break when it comes to song and instrument. It's just not my thing. I guess I'll give the movie a pass, but only because the music is great.

Movie Review

To be honest with you, this movie was almost boring. It was a little slow, and I was wondering if the movie would ever end. The music was great, but the movie had no reason to exist. It was a pretty good movie, but not anything great.

I would recommend this movie to everyone. It's not a good movie, but it's not a bad movie. I would give it a 7.5/10.

The only good thing about this album is he sings "I got my own" and "We got love" a lot, but the rest of the album, in my opinion, is a total waste of time and money.  I have never listened to anything by Twiztid, ever, but the first time I listened to this album, it was awful.  I am guessing it was the same with the second listen.  I would strongly recommend not purchasing this record.  I have seen them in concert and I have always been impressed by their music, but I cannot find any redeeming value in this album.  I will not buy any Twiztid albums. I will only buy records by other artists.  That's my only recommendation.  I do however, listen to other artists music by all kinds of genres, but when something is this badly recorded, it is not worth the money.  It's just a waste of time and money.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: No me gusta nada el tema "Amor con el cielo" pero lo que me gusta es la música que lo interpreta.  En el video se ve a dos personas y se puede ver a la cantante de la música como una mujer desafiante y un matador en su lucha.  Aunque este video es de una canción de Gloria Estefan y le parece que se trata del video de Gloria Estefan para "Amor con el cielo", la que me gusta es la cantante de la música.  La sonrisa de la cantante me encanta, se ve como una mujer y no como una que cantó para una mala canción.  La música es muy guapa y la canción muy bien interpretada

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's got me singing along.  I've never really liked or disliked the music that Thalia is singing in, but this album has really been getting to me.  I've always been a fan of Gloria Estefan and so when I saw this album, I was like, "I gotta have this!"  I'm not the biggest Thalia fan, but this album is definitely for the fans of Gloria Estefan and the music of Gloria Estefan.  There's just something about her that makes her seem different and different.  It's not that she's "bad" or "terrible" but she has a very unique sound to her, and it makes for some interesting listening.  This album is definitely worth the price.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Gloria Estefan is a very talented singer and songwriter.  I love her music.  I love the way she sings.  I love the lyrics.  I love the way she sings and I love the way she writes.  Her songs are very different from other songs.  They're very unique and they always leave me wanting more.  I love her music and I love her voice.  I love how I can listen to her music on my way to work and then have another song pop up in my head as I am driving home.  I absolutely LOVE this album.  I can't wait to hear the next one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:    A classic of the musical world.  When I first heard Gloria Estefan singing, I was like, "Wow, this is great!"  I've been listening to her since I was a little girl.  Gloria Estefan has always been just a little bit ahead of the curve in the music world and she's always been a force to be reckoned with.  When I first heard her singing, she was already a legend and here I am, listening to her albums in the same way I've always listened to the "classic" albums.  I can't help but to think that this album is a masterpiece.  This album is a collection of love songs, but it's also a collection of songs that are very different from each other.  Each song is very different and it's a great album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   In my opinion, this is one of the best albums of 2016.  She's back!  She's back with a new album.  I can't believe it, but I'm actually really enjoying this album.  I still love Gloria Estefan, but this album is just as good as, if not better than, the last album.  It's absolutely fantastic.  She's singing everything very well and I love how the lyrics are so good and so creative.  I love the overall sound of the album as well.  She's got a great voice and she's got the best musicians in the world working with her.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   Gloria Estefan has a great voice.  She can sing great songs and she can sing songs where she is the lead singer.  Her voice is good and the songs she sings are great.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I have listened to the albums on repeat for 3 days now. I am a Christian, and I have discovered this band. I am a musician myself, and I have been searching for new music to add to my collection for years. I have always believed in God, and I have tried to follow Him. So I was very excited about this band, but I am disappointed. This is the first Christian band that I have heard that tries to push an "out" message to its listeners. This band has a message they believe in, but it is not being presented to the masses.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was in a Christian church prior to this album. My family was very Christian. This album is not like any other Christian music. There is no message that is promoting God. One of the songs is, "God is good, God will never let you down", and another song is, "God is fair". You could have just as easily heard this band on a Christian radio station. There are no songs that are promoting the Lord, instead I found a bunch of songs about God. I am not saying that the songs are bad, but they just don't fit into my life. God is good, and will never let you down. God is fair. I don't know about God being fair, because I haven't found out the truth. The songs that are not promoted are the songs that I don't like, and the songs that I do like are not promoted. So this album does not fit into my life.

Amazon review: I was very excited about this album and bought it at a Christian bookstore and was disappointed. It was a very average album. The songs were nothing special.

I am disappointed in the fact that these "out" songs are not promoting God and are not promoting Christianity. I am disappointed in the fact that the message is not promoting God. I am disappointed in the fact that the songs are not promoting the Gospel. The songs are not promoting God.

I don't believe that God wants me to be a Christian or that he wants people to be Christians, but I don't believe the songs are trying to promote God or Christianity. The songs are trying to promote self-promotion. The songs are trying to promote a "You are a Christian" attitude. The songs are trying to promote a "You can be a Christian" attitude. The songs are promoting a "You can be a Christian, so why don't you." attitude. The songs are promoting a "I want to be a Christian" attitude.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD, I thought the music was really good, but it was too fast.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who thought that.  As a matter of fact, I was listening to this CD at the same time as my wife was listening to a cd by the Bishops, and I noticed that she liked it a lot.  The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it was a little slow and I thought that it was out of my comfort zone.  The second time I listened to this CD, I realized that it was very fast and at the same time, I could not stop listening to it.  I didn't listen to the Bishops for a long time, because I never thought that this CD was good.  I thought it sounded too fast.  I heard the Bishops only when I thought about what they did.  I am one of the people who thinks that they don't have a good style.  At the same time, I like when I listen to music, I like the sound of them, the way they sound.  I was listening to this CD when I was thinking about what they do.  They don't do a lot of harmonies, but they do harmonies and they do them very well.  I am amazed, because I have never heard a band that does harmonies like this.  I thought this band was perfect for me.  I just started listening to the Bishops, and I just love the harmonies and the way that they sound.  They have different harmonies, but they don't sound like different bands.  I am listening to the Bishops because I am waiting for their CD.  I was waiting for their CD when I started to listen to this CD.  I want to hear a band that uses the same old things and the same old style.  That's what I want to hear.  I like the harmonies of this album, they are very nice and they are very different.  The harmonies of this album are very nice, but they are different.  I am listening to the Bishops because I am waiting for the CD.  I want to hear the CD when it's done.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This is a great CD for beginners as well as advanced students.  I have been taking voice lessons for over 5 years and I have never sang in front of anyone before.  I am hoping to attend a vocal studio to continue with lessons. I have taken lessons from a very good teacher and I am hoping to take lessons from a better instructor.  The voice teacher on this CD was very nice.  I don't have a lot of experience with music and I am hoping to get better at it as I continue to take lessons.  I enjoyed this CD and would recommend it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I am so glad I got this CD. I can't sing. I can't play music. I don't know how to express my feelings.  I have no confidence and that is the only reason I can't sing.  I have never felt like I was the best or could do anything.  I have to be so perfect and I can't! But, I am so glad I listened to this song because I was in deep and it was so easy to cry.  I didn't know that I would be able to actually cry.  I didn't know that it would feel like I had to.  This song is the one that helped me learn how to cry.  Thank you, Sarah, for teaching me.  You are the best!

Amazon review: What's so fun about doing something new?  I think it is so much fun to be open about what we do and what we don't do and what we want to do and what we want to become.  My goal was to become a singer and I have been singing since the moment I could talk.  I think I was about 2 or 3.  My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor since I was a little girl but I begged them to let me go into music.  I am very passionate about it and I have a great voice.  I love singing and making people feel good and happy.  I also love to dance and I can dance to anything.   My family is really supportive and I love them so much.

Amazon review: This song was my first song I ever learned.  I know it's a little corny but it really stuck with me.  I've always been a great singer.  I always love to sing but I always had to sing in the back of the house because I couldn't get out front of everyone.  I can get out front, but it takes a lot of concentration because I have been in the back of the house most of my life.  I was always a little scared to sing, until I listened to this song.  I love it and I love the lyrics.  This song is a call to action!  It motivates me to be a better singer and a better person.  This song reminds me to be true to who I am and to let people see it.  I don't want to be a fake.  I want to be authentic with people.

I don't really listen to music while I'm doing things but I think this CD is a good addition to my music.  I can't help but sing along with the songs.  It is definitely a good addition to my music.  I think I have a new favorite song on my iPod.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Title: The Night Has Eyes Of A Cat
Artist: The Damned
Album: The Damned
Track: The Night Has Eyes Of A Cat
Running Time: 55:11
Format: CD
Recorded: June 12, 2006- June 16, 2006
Producer: Martin Birch, Michael Barson
Recorded at: The Big Chill Studios, London.
Mixed: The Big Chill Studios, London.
Additional Recording: Wunderkammer Studio, London.
Mastered: Sterling Sound, New York.
Note: First pressing of CD was released with some
differing track names. It should have been renamed.

This is the original version of The Damned's song.  Most versions of this song are very similar, with only a few changes.  You can listen to this song on the first track of The Damned's album, The Damned.  It contains the song that would eventually be called "The Night Has Eyes Of A Cat".

This is the second version of The Damned's song.  It is the same as the first, but it is slightly different.  A listen to this song should prove that this is the same song.

This is the third version of The Damned's song.  This version is the same as the second, but it is slightly different.  A listen to this song should show that this is also the same song.

This is the fourth version of The Damned's

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I like the original concept of the album and I can see why it was made. I liked the fact that it was made of all the songs that LMM had written. I would have liked to see less songs dedicated to the original characters. I don't have much of a problem with the rest of the songs. The only thing that I don't like is that it is repetitive. I feel that I would like to hear more songs about the original characters. The songs I like are: I, II, III, VI, XI, XII, XIII, XIV. The only one that I did not like is XIII. Overall I think that a lot of different artists should be on this album. I would like to see it on a different singer. The first singer I would like to see is Cee Lo Green. I know he is a great singer but I believe that he is better suited to this kind of music. I think he would do a great job with this album.

I had no idea that I was listening to the lyrics of the song "I am not perfect". I liked this song so much. I still like it. But the rest of the songs just don't sound right to me. It is strange that the album is called I am not perfect because the lyrics of the song "I am not perfect" are very negative. The song "I am not perfect" is very good. The song "I am not perfect" is good. The song "Someday I Will Be" is good. The song "I am not perfect" is good. The only one that I do not like is the song "I am not perfect" because it is just too boring. Also the song "I am not perfect" is too short.

I don't know why people like to sing along to this kind music and it takes away from the songs that they aren't singing along to. I do like the song "I am not perfect" but it is just too short.
