Amazon review: I bought this when the first U.S. Navy band version was going to be released. The band is very much in the ballpark of the "normal" U.S. Navy Band, but I felt like a total sucker for buying this version the day before they released it. I've listened to both versions. I find the Navy Band version to be a little on the mellow side and more mellow than what I expected. The solo in "When The Lighthouse Turns" is a little choppy. I would expect a more upbeat song like "Stars and Stripes Forever" or "Trouble In My Mind" or "My Heart Belongs To Daddy." But I still liked this version a lot and I thought it was very good. Overall, a nice addition to the disc.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this artist for a long time, and not only because of her amazing style. However, the reason I have always listened to her is because her music is so uplifting and touching. Whether it is the gentle, positive lyrics or the emotional ballads, I always find myself falling in love with her music. This album is a great example of her musical growth. I love this album for its versatility, and the fact that it is so personal. I feel like I can listen to this album more than once, and that is a rare feeling in this day and age. I am definitely a fan of this album.

Amazon review: Here is a fine album. Great, rich, bluesy, soulful music. I like the sound of the album best on the second half, when they play ballads, but every track is excellent.

Amazon review: I have no idea where to begin to describe this album. It starts off with "Bobby McGee's Blues," which is one of the best tracks on the album and the best song of theirs I have ever heard. Then "Black Magic Woman" and "Mama's Little Girl," both songs have some of their best lyrics in them. The album continues on with "C.J. & the Sunshine Band" and "Mighty River," which are both great songs to listen to. "Sweet Lorraine" is one of the better ballads on the album, and their version of "Sweet Lorraine" is the best I have ever heard. And the last song on the album is "Wine," which is just wonderful. I love the fact that they are not really a pop band, they are more of a bluesy band.

I like the harmonies, but the vocals are not my favorites.  I don't know why it's on this list.  This is a very very, very good song.  The lyrics are very deep.  They're very, very deep.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Amazon review: I bought this album on amazon in hopes of getting a great deal on it. It came in the mail in a big box and when I opened it I noticed the cardboard had been replaced with a plastic bag. I called customer service and they said that it was an issue that happened many times before (they had been experiencing a lot of returning customers lately). I was told that because the plastic bag could withstand the shipping process it would be cheaper to return the CD and receive a new one. I decided to give the CD a go and I am glad I did!! This album is worth every penny and more!!!

Amazon review: Seriously? No wonder black people laugh at us. I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio. This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

Amazon review: They're all singing really well, and the bass is very good, but the lead singers are horrible. I can't hear the vocals and I've listened to this song for hours and hours.

Amazon review: Jonatha Brooke has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. She is also one of the most under-rated songwriters in the country. The Story was a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90s that included Jennifer Kimball. The harmonies that Jonatha and Jennifer created were/are inspired, and at times, their heart wrenching melodies could bring you to tears.  My two favorite songs from Jonatha are 'So Much Mine' (from Story - Angel in the House) and 'Eye in the Sky' (from Jonatha Brooke - Back in the Circus).

Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: I bought this for my brother, and was dumb enough to listen to it before I gave it too him.  I've heard a thousand country songs that say the same things, just with different words.  "Somebody stole my truck, some guy ran off with my girlfriend, somebody shot my dog, and I'm too drunk to do anything about any of it."  Don't waste your time and money.  Just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little.  You'll get the same results.

Amazon review: I was in love with this album.  I was so excited about it that I bought a copy even though I knew nothing about the artist - but I had to get it.  It was very good.  This album is about 5/10, but the songs like "Praise the Lord" and "Jesus Saves" and "God is Love" are good.  I do miss the "Lover" and "Love Hurts" and "This Little Light of Mine" that I have on the second CD.  I do have the third CD, however, and will try to listen to it now that I am back home.  The CD has a good collection of songs.  The lyrics are all written by some unknown person, and it is the only CD of this artist that I have.  I have listened to it at least a dozen times, and there are many songs that I have not heard before.  I am a big fan of this artist.

Amazon review: This album is a great listen to the end.  The first CD, The Passion, is very good.  I'm not going to say much about the second CD, "Come to Life" because I don't want to give anything away, but it is all over the place.  It has a good collection of songs.  I still listen to it every few weeks.  The third CD, "All the Way to Heaven," is a little on the long side, but has the good songs from "The Passion", "Come to Life" and "All the Way to Heaven".  The songs on this CD are all good.  Very well sung.  I was disappointed when I found out that the CD was only going to be available for a limited time.  I really wanted to finish the whole CD, but I can't get to it too often.  I am going to buy the whole CD. I think the songs on this CD are better than the songs on "Come to Life".  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the Christian Country genre.  This album is worth the purchase.  I am a fan.

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I was a big fan of Chicago before they made this album. The music was great and I always wondered why the band didn't make a record with Peter Cetera on vocals.  But this is a great album and I really enjoyed it.  I will continue to buy their CDs and will buy their records as soon as I can, as I feel that they don't have anything to offer me anymore!

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a while now and have actually grown to love it.  However, I have to admit that the album is not the best of the Chicago albums.  I will be listening to this album for many years to come and probably will buy it again one day.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is the best Chicago release.  I love the Chicago sound and it's great to hear new music from Chicago, though I really dig the new material.  And the band is so much better than their last album.  Peter Cetera is a great vocalist and Robert Lamm's guitar playing on this album is fantastic.  It's a great album, and I am excited to see what the next album will be like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First off, I love all of the songs.  I particularly enjoy the songs that have Peter Cetera on vocals.  There are a few songs that I don't care for, but overall I think the majority of the songs are excellent.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that the album is over an hour long. I don't mind the length, but I will be skipping the second half of the album because I can't stand listening to all the filler.  It's all good music, but I think that it would be better if there was just a little less of the filler.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say I really like this CD.  I really like the songs.  The vocals are good and the sound is very good.  I love the music.  This is a good CD.  I'll probably buy this album a second time, but I don't feel like this album is as good as the first one.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: I found the album "The Beatles: On Air" to be a really interesting listen.  It seemed like a mix of the Beatles and other artists.  Some of the songs were a bit repetitive, but, this album was really interesting.  Some of the songs on here were really good and some of the songs were not as good, but, this album was still a pretty interesting listen.  "I Don't Wanna Go Home" is a good song, but, I found a lot of songs on here not to be good, or, not to be very memorable.  "Here, There and Everywhere" is a good song, but, I found a lot of songs here that are not very memorable.

Of course the samples that are given don't let you know that.  Worst 1.99 I have spent.  May not seem like a lot to Amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window.  Amazon can do that with it's own money.  I won't purchase another music from them.

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: I am a bit of a sucker for good music, and this album is fantastic. It's nice to hear a hip hop album with a little more than 2 lines of lyrics per song. I was pleasantly surprised. It was nice to have a clean album that doesn't try too hard to be good.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but it's more of a compilation of songs than an album. I like this album, but it's certainly not a groundbreaking album.

###
Amazon review: This is a really great album, but it isn't quite what you'd consider a typical Hip Hop album. It has a lot of really catchy songs, but I would consider myself an experienced Hip Hop listener and therefore I find that some of the songs sound a bit generic. Some of the best songs are 'Shoot N' Run' and 'I'm All About It' (the latter of which is a really good song.)
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album was very good. For the most part, it's a very good album. It is not overproduced, and the production is really good. It's not a lot to it, but it is a strong album. The main problem is that the songs themselves are not very memorable. I think this album is a great mix of hip hop and pop songs, but that's about it.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album. It was a gift, and I am glad that I had the chance to listen to it. I don't like the sound, I find it too noisy. I thought it was nice of the guy to give it to me. I will check out the other albums.

You can listen to this album over and over again.  You can sing it, dance to it, and put it on for your friends.  Its a great album. I love the vocals on this album. This is by far one of the best albums of the 90s.

Amazon review: One of the best albums of all time. I have bought several of his albums, and they are all great.  This album has a huge sound that is very different from all the other albums.

Great performer. probably a decent guy.  But let's take one of those off the market!  It makes this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or "sneaky".

Amazon review: I thought that the song was going to be Adam singing it and once I heard a clip of it on iTunes. I realized that it wasn't him a all (from the very beginning of it). I did not like the song just from the clip I heard. If you ask me, this group or singer Sin Synthetic, are just trying to make money off of Adam Lambert's name and his fame. I almost bought the cd here from Amazon. I'm so glad that I didn't.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today. I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [.]. of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability.

Amazon review: This was a huge hit for Bill Evans. Unfortunately, this song was written by Billy Joel.  It's not even funny, but really sad to know that you can't find the original Billy Joel song on the internet.  If anyone knows where this song may be on the internet, feel free to let me know.  I would have loved to hear his version of this song.  I would have preferred his version to the Billy Joel version.

Amazon book review: I have heard this song many times in church.  I heard this song in a sermon a couple of years ago and thought it was very inspirational.  I downloaded this song and made sure to download it into a MP3 player to listen to it on the way to church.  There is a message in this song which I think is really cool.  The message in this song is that you are a wonderful person and you have been given this great gift and it is your responsibility to share it with others.  The song also says that Christ is real and you should be a Christian.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon book review: At first I was a bit confused by this song.  It seemed to be about giving up your life for Christ, but the message is much more than that.  The message is that all Christians are Christians because all Christians have been Christians for a very long time and were therefore familiar with the life of Christ.  The song says that the greatest gift that you have is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the greatest gift to you.  The song says that you should be a Christian because if you are not a Christian then you are an idiot.  The message of this song is very simple but to me it is very powerful.

The song says that we need to live a life that is full of life.  The song says that everyone has a choice to live a life full of joy or a life full of pain and darkness.  The song says that we need to choose to live a life that is full of joy.  The song says that we need to choose to live a life full of light.

After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.
