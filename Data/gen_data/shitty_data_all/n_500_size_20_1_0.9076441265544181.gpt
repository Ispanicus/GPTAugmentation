It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I bought this album in hopes that the new songs would be different from the old.  But they are the same songs with different lyrics and a different arrangement. I am a fan of the original version but I do not like the new version.  Not even close to being as good as the original version.  The new version is not even close to being a decent version of the song.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner's tape for anyone who likes to listen to music. Some of the songs are good, but some of the songs are just filler and probably won't appeal to all. I would not buy this tape again; it's not worth the price.

This is the best mix tape I have ever bought. It is very diverse, great song selection, well played and great quality. I would recommend this to any music lover.

I purchased this mix tape in hopes of getting back some of my money from the recent sale on my CD collection. I had to purchase several more copies as my wife still hadn't caught on to the fact that I had purchased some of my CD collection and was now in the process of selling it off. I would recommend this tape to

Amazon review: This is not a record I would buy on my own, but I found it on amazon. So I bought it. When I bought it, I was trying to figure out the name of the singer. You can figure that out from the title. The singer is called "Juanita." The name of the record is "A Love That Kills" I found the artist name "Teleka." So I bought this album. Now, I am in the process of putting this album to death. It is not the only album I have of Teleka. I have many other Teleka albums. This is one of them. I'm sure it will be killed and I will find another Teleka album that I will give to the world. I would like to thank the producer and the label for letting me put this album to death.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Savage Garden - Live @ The Bottom Line

A great live album from the band. It was recorded before they broke up. But it came out later on in 1998. The band plays a great set.

The last song is "You're The Devil" by the band, but it is not the greatest song. I think the song should be in the next album.

The band plays a great set. Their drummer is awesome.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review:  I love Bob Dylan! I grew up playing his music and being around him has given me a great deal of inspiration and a great appreciation for all of the amazing musicians who are so talented. I don't think that a person can possibly list all the artists and songs that Bob Dylan has influenced music in general and the music in particular. I don't think that you can even list all of his accomplishments.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this album is great. I love Bob Dylan and love the music that is included on this album but my favorite part of the album is the way he has told the story through his poetry that's included on the album. His stories have been told and sung and this album is in full color and the lyrics are really neat. I also love the fact that he is a musician, and has a beautiful voice and you can tell that he listens to other musical artists and makes sure to incorporate them in the songs. I also love the fact that the songs are set to music that you can sing along to. I truly recommend this album.
