Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I bought this CD in the late 1980's and have not used it yet.  The first time I heard it I liked it very much; I bought a second copy.  This time I didn't want to buy another copy.

I am glad I didn't buy a CD just to listen to, because I didn't really get the full effect.  I listened to the first album and decided I would buy this one.  I listened to it on my stereo when I was in the car and I decided to buy it.  I listened to it at home and this time decided not to buy it.

I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's work and his albums, and not to mention the fact I've tried to get most of his albums.  However, this is the first time I've tried to get his latest work (I heard it at a local theater) and it is just not as good as the others.   
I'm not trying to rag on this album; I'm just trying to make a point that this is his most recent work and I don't think it is as good as his "classic" albums.  He's just not the same kind of guy, and it's not his best album.  
Overall, I just don't think this is his best work.

I love this song! I am a big fan of classic rock and I enjoy listening to classic rock and all the great songs that came from the golden era of music. I am very glad I found this album. I have purchased many, many CDs and there are so many great albums out there. I have been listening to this album for the past year and I really enjoy it and it was worth the money! I enjoy listening to oldies but goodies and this one is no exception. I am glad I found this album and I would buy it again and again.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I know the music style is going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a pretty talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me.  The songs are very "meh".  I'm not a fan of the first song, "I'm Not Okay".  The second song, "This Girl's Crazy", is very self-indulgent and isn't my favorite song on the album.  The last song, "Goodbye", is a bit of a weak song.  The only good songs are "I'm Not Okay" and "Goodbye".  I'm kind of tired of listening to this and I don't like how it's released.  I hope Meghan decides to release a new album soon.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I should have waited to open my package and re-listen, but I didn't want to lose it, so I just bought it. After listening to the song a few times, I found that the vocals were very weak. The song is great for people who need to strengthen their singing ability, but I do prefer the "traditional" vocals. It is not that it is bad that I did not like it, I just didn't get what I was expecting. I will not be ordering it again, so if you are a Christian, get this CD.

I don't know why people would want to hear him anymore. I can't stand the guy. But then, I am not a fan of his music. I have to say that I am not impressed by his CD's.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I don't think that it is over-exposure, i think it is over-emphasis.  I think that its use should be more limited and it should be used wisely.  I am very thankful for this song.

Amazon review: I purchased the song because I love the song "What You Need" by Robert Johnson.  What You Need has a great beat to it.  It is just a song that has that beat.

When you play the song you begin to understand what it is.  It is a simple song.  You can tell that it is simple.  It is just a nice song.  The song is a very nice song.  It is just a simple slow song that has a good beat to it.  You do not have to have a good beat or beat.  You can play the song with an ordinary beat.  You can play the song without a beat and it will still have a beat to it.  The beat is not a part of the song.  It is not a part of the song.  I like this song.  I would recommend this song to my friends and family.  I have been listening to it on the radio.  I would recommend this song to my friends and family.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This album is very different from Title, and I have to say that the new songs are very good. I have to admit, though, that I have a lot of trouble putting this CD on, but once I am in the car it's nice. This CD is very different from Title and I have to say that the new songs are very good. I love Meghan Trainor and this album is a good step in the right direction.

I got an e-mail from Sony asking if I liked their new CD, "Me: I See You" and I was so happy when I got it in the mail! I absolutely love the artwork, and the song "You Do Want to Know" is one of my favorites. I have downloaded the song "Saving Grace" for my daughter, and she gets so excited when she listens to it. It's great to see people who have a positive view on life, and not just the negative. I love how the lyrics are uplifting, like, "I get to live in a world where I can see every color of the rainbow." I love it!

I love the new album!!! I got a new CD from Sony today and I have to say this one is better than Title. The songs are so much better and I love the new songs they have put out. I got the album of Title and I love it but I cannot get into this one. If you are a Sony Lover I would highly recomend it.

I love this album! I got the album Title, which was okay, but I love this one. I love the title song and the whole album. I got it at my local store for $14.

Very good! I got the album Title for $14 and I love it. I would say the songs are very good. There are some good songs and some not so good, I know. I like it and will buy it again.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this CD.  I thought I had a lot of good songs and I did but this was just a disappointment and I'm glad I bought it.  "You're So Beautiful" is a great song but I think the other songs on this CD were just average.  "You're So Beautiful" is about a woman who is very beautiful but is a bit of a sissy so when she sees a man she is a bit jealous of him.  The song is based on a true story from the Bible, but it is not very good so I doubt that it is very appropriate for the subject matter.  The only good song in this CD is "All I Want".  It is a nice song but it is about a man who is a very good singer but is not very good at the piano so he is a very good singer but a bad pianist.  I thought that song was very good, it is about a man who is a very good singer but is not good at everything.  "All I Want" is about a woman who is a very beautiful but is a bit of a sissy so when she sees someone she is a bit jealous of him.  The song is based on someone who wrote a song a long time ago when she was a teenager.  The woman is very beautiful but is a bit of a sissy.  On the other hand this song is about a woman who is very beautiful but is a bit of a fool.  The woman is very beautiful but she really is a fool.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A very special record, and it is very hard to pick a favorite.  The song "You're so Beautiful" is a nice song, but the other songs on this album are all very good.  "A Little Bit of Heaven" is a good song, but the other songs on this album are all very good.
