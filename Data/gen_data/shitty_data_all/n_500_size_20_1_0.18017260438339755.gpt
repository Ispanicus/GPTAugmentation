Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review:  I don't know what I've been expecting from the Killers lately, but this album was disappointing.  I think Brandon is still a great singer, and he has a great voice, but this album wasn't as great as the previous two Killers albums.  He can still write great music, but not with the same intensity and passion he had with those other albums.  I think they should just give him his own band.  It would be better than this.

It's a shame that the band has been playing these songs for so long, and have been so indifferent to them, and have not released another album like this since Killers released their last one in December.  Killers are a great band.  Keep doing what you are doing.  I love the Killers.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

They have a few good songs on it, but most of the songs are really boring. The song "Darling Nikki", for instance, is just boring. I can't say anything bad about this album, I've had it for years, and I'm still a fan of the Killers. What I can say is that this cd is not worth the money. It's just an average cd.

Amazon review: This song is so painful and depressing that I will have to write my own.  I have listened to Plumb's songs for years and I have been disappointed with each one.  I just hate to see a musician that I have always enjoyed and admired, who has never had any major success, do so poorly.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review:  John Lennon is one of the greatest singers ever, and I've been a fan of him for a long time.  I've been a fan of him and his music since I was a little girl.  I first heard John Lennon when I was about six years old.  I had no idea what I was listening to when I was six years old.  I just remember thinking, 'I want to hear John Lennon.'  I found out that he was an incredible singer when I was about ten years old.  I was about the same age as my parents when they decided to buy me a cassette of Beatles songs.  I didn't know much about music at that time, but I remember listening to The Beatles and thinking, 'This is great!  I want to listen to this all the time.'  That cassette lasted me through high school and into my adult life.  I have loved John Lennon ever since that time.  I have been a fan of his music since I was a little girl.  I have a son who is almost exactly three years old.  He first heard The Beatles when he was about one.  His father decided to buy him a cassette of albums that he could play to him.  He never played his cassette of albums for very long at all.  He would play one song for about five minutes, then he would move on to another one.  His favorite album was John Lennon's 'Imagine'.  He would listen to it for over thirty minutes.  He was so enthralled by the music that he would cry the entire time.  When he was older, I decided that I would like to get a cassette player for him.  I decided to buy him a Beatles album, and when it was over, I brought it to him.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

The only time I have trouble singing along to Christmas songs is when I want to sing along to a song that I don't know.  But with the great songs I have heard over the years, I would not mind singing along to any song.  I have even heard people singing along to an old Christmas song, even though they did not know the words.  And the only time I have trouble singing along to a song that I know is when I first heard it.  I don't know why people think singing along to them is hard.  I have known some singers who have even sung along to songs they did not know, and they could do it.  So why is it hard to sing along to songs that you know?  Well, because the music is supposed to be so familiar to you that you don't think about the song you are singing.  So the song is just going to come out of your head, and you don't have to think about it.  Then when you think about it, you are singing it in your mind.  I am sure people think that I am crazy.  But that is why I like to sing along with Christmas songs.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: From a band that I never really knew existed until I read an interview with them. All the songs I ever thought they sounded like this from years ago.  The instrumentation is the same, but it's a whole different sound, with a different feel.  My wife likes this album and her friends agree.  It's good.  I can't wait to get a copy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I think I am in love with this album. I have listened to it three times now.  The songs are so different from the other albums I have seen them on and the overall album was so much better than the other albums.  It has a very unique sound to it and I like it.  I am glad I saw them live in New York.  I hope that they will be touring soon.  I would love to see them in the UK.  I see they are not very popular in the UK.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I did not know of this band until I was listening to one of their songs on a friend's recommendation.  The other songs I had heard before, but I do like this new album.  I think it has a different sound than the others.  I have a feeling that it will be the one that they are going to tour.  They have a new album coming out and they are going to be on tour in the spring in the US.  I will be a very happy man.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have yet to listen to this album but my wife and I have been listening to it for over a week now.  Our only complaint is that I have already listened to four songs.  I would say that I don't like the lyrics for several of the songs.  I would have preferred to hear more songs with lyrics.  I hate to sound cliche when I say this but I do like the songs with the songs where you can hear the vocals and the guitar.  I thought they were very well done.  I am looking forward to hearing more of their music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this band!  I have had the CD's for over a year now and have listened to them all.  I like the music and the lyrics.  I would recommend this to anyone!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

The following reviews are for the song "The Night of the Living Dead" by the band "The Allman Brothers Band":

"The Night of the Living Dead" by The Allman Brothers Band

I am a fan of the Allman Brothers Band and never really understood all the controversy surrounding this song. I understand that the Allman Brothers were known for their songwriting abilities and their song's ability to express emotion but I didn't understand the controversy surrounding the song. Now I do. I think that this is one of the best songs that they have ever written. The lyrics and the music is both very positive. The sound quality is good and it is a very positive song. I suggest that you should buy this song and listen to it before you buy it.

Amazon review: The song is good, but the singer is not very good. The song is very depressing and the singer is not very good. The song is a very good song, but the singer is horrible.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is great! I like it very much! The only thing I don't care for is that the singer doesn't know how to play the guitar. He knows how to play the drums, but he doesn't know how to play the guitar.

I have been listening to songs, reading reviews and articles and now it's time for my own review. I am a huge fan of the Allman Brothers Band. I love their music and I love their lyrics. I enjoy listening to The Allman Brothers Band. I enjoy reading about their career and am glad that they are still performing as they are. So, I decided to write a review for The Allman Brothers Band.
I have to admit that I don't really know much about the band. I know that they were a huge influence on the blues movement in the 1960's, but I don't think that they were that great. I don't want to say that they were a great band, but they were certainly a good band. Their name is well known throughout the music industry, and they have been a major influence on many bands.
So, I have to admit that I have never really learned much about the band. I don't know much about the history of the band, or who the members are. I don't know what was going on in their lives. I don't know much about their early years, or their careers. So, I decided to look online and read about the band for myself. I searched for The Allman Brothers Band, and I found three articles:
The Allman Brothers Band biography and all of their lyrics,
An article about the band's career, and
A review of

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wanted to love this album. I really did. It was easy to pick up and not to easily forget. But, I was so wrong. I wish I would have listened to it first before buying it. The songs are extremely well written and arranged, and the production is top notch. I didn't feel like they were trying to sound like they were playing in a church basement. They actually sounded great live.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songs are really good, but I was expecting something different, and these guys don't do that. They sound like average, everyday rock bands with a little bit of pop, and they don't have much to them. I'd rather have a normal rock band like Korn or Slipknot, these guys are just average, and I couldn't get into them.
Sentiment: Negative
