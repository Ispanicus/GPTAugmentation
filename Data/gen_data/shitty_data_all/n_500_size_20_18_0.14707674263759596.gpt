Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: This album is a complete work of genius. It's so fun to listen to. I'm a big Pink Floyd fan. I don't really think the lyrics are appropriate. They are too long.  What I find funny is that my mother has been listening to this album for about 2 years. This is her first listen to it. I have never heard anything from her that I like so much. She just started liking Pink Floyd after that. She is one of the greatest Pink Floyd fans I have ever met.

I like most of the lyrics, but there are a couple of lines I don't get, like "You're so good at making me feel like a king".  It's not a good line, but it's a line I have to listen to.  The other lines that I don't get are like "I want you to know that I'm not a bad man."  I don't know if I understand that.  It's not a bad line, so I have to listen to it. I don't think the lyrics are appropriate or funny, but I really like the music.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I am a music listener (to a certain extent) and I've never heard this before.

I would like to see the song performed a bit differently before I could comment further on it.
I can tell from the notes the song is composed of a mix of styles and I would guess that is what is intended.

Yes, these are the ones I am aware of.

I like the sound of the organ playing and I like the sound of the voice.

I am not sure of the intended meaning of the song but I am sure it is a beautiful one.

I think the voice and the piano are wonderful and I like the composition of the song.

The organ is a bit on the high side for me though so I am a little concerned

The sixth line, "I don't like your ass," is pretty much just her ass.  The seventh line, "I don't like your face, your face is ugly."  I think it's a quote from the movie.  The eighth line, "I don't like your ugly nose."  I don't know if the nose is ugly or not, but it's definitely ugly.  The ninth line, "I don't like your ugly lips."  I don't know if it's a quote from the movie, but it's definitely her lips.  The tenth line, "I don't like your ugly ass."  I don't know if the ass is ugly or not, but it is definitely ugly.  The eleventh line, "I don't like your ugly mouth."  I don't know if the mouth is ugly or not, but it is definitely ugly.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: I've been an avid fan of Cee Lo's music for a very long time and I was very hoping that this album would be at least as great as his previous releases.  But, I was completely disappointed.  The album's only redeemable quality is that it is not bad, but Cee Lo himself has nothing to offer.  He sounds like he's reading from a script.  I can't imagine not having this album on my computer.

Amazon review: I have heard a lot of bad stuff when it comes to Cee Lo Green, but this is definitely the worst.  I have been a fan of his for years and really hope that he can at least get past this crap.  I still can't get behind his latest CD, but this is by far his worst.  The worst song is called "Smoke" and is called "Smoke" in it's entirety.  I don't know what the hell goes on in that mind of his, but he is definitely one of the worst singers I've ever heard.  The title track is just downright awful.  Also, I hate everything about the album.  I am going to wait until the next album comes out before I give this one another chance.

That's the first time I've ever felt that way about a Cee Lo album.  I've heard so many great albums by this guy but this one is the worst by far.  I can't stand the first track on the CD.  The rest of the album is just plain awful.  I don't know what the hell is going on in Cee Lo's head but his singing is just stupid.  This is one of his worst albums ever.  The worst song is called "Smoke" and is called Smoke in it's entirety.  I don't know what the hell goes in this guy's head but his singing is just stupid.  I hate everything about the album.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: My favorite songs were the ones that sounded like they were written for me to enjoy.  They were the ones I actually found myself listening to.  "I'm Not Sorry" was my favorite, then I found a version of a song I had never heard before, which I loved, "What You Have to Do", "I Don't Believe You" which I have always put on at the end of my set, and finally "I Couldn't See You" which I love to this day.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of her singing, but I think that she is trying to do too much with it.  She sounds a bit robotic, almost like a robot (or one in the "weird" category).  There are too many notes going on too close together.  I think if she really concentrated on her singing, she would have more range, and it would be a lot more interesting.  But her singing is great, and I love the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like it, but I think that it's too old-fashioned.  I thought that the lyrics were very clever, but they didn't really fit what I've heard on the radio.  And there are too many vocal mistakes, in the way of the songs too often sounding flat.  I think that it would sound better if it was mixed to be more like a soundstage recording.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first time I listened to this, I had an idea that it was going to be a collection of songs that were similar to each other, but I was wrong.  I really think that this cd is just one big love song.  Toni was singing about her feelings for Ray, and she was being honest.  She sounds like she is really in love with him, and she is a very beautiful woman, so that makes it even more wonderful.  I think that is the strength of this album; Toni was able to be honest about her feelings, and she is singing about a relationship that she has, and being a wonderful woman.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I never expected to find another song by Toni Braxton that I like as much as "I'm Not Sorry", but I loved this one also.  I think that it would be more believable to sing a song that is about being in love, and she does, in "I'm Not Sorry".  If this song was in a movie, I would expect her to be singing about a relationship that is going nowhere, but she is not, she is singing about a relationship that is the best thing that ever happened to her.  She is singing about the love that she feels for Ray, and it's very beautiful.

Amazon review: I have heard this song in many different versions, and I always like to hear it again.  I've never heard it before, but I like the way that it's sung by Toni Braxton.  It's a very mature song, and it shows how she is still in control of herself.

I have been an Elvis fan since I was a little kid. I have seen him live several times and have only ever been disappointed. Elvis is my favorite musician because I think he is one of the most entertaining and unique musicians that has ever lived. I feel like he is able to make the audience feel special. I think he is also able to make the audience feel like they are in the same room as him. Elvis is one of the most interesting people I have ever met.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: I listened to the song "God's Not Dead" by Casting Crowns - and I thought it was great!  I like it a lot, but I'm having a hard time finding it on Amazon or listening to it elsewhere.  I've searched a lot and have not found it for sale.  Does anyone know where I can find this song for sale?

Amazon review: I am a fan of Casting Crowns, and I bought this CD for my wife.  I'm going to listen to it tonight, but I have one problem - I downloaded it on my computer, and it just gets stuck in my CD player.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong - but I can't figure it out.  Any advice?

Amazon review: I purchased this CD as I have been a fan of Casting Crowns for years.  I was excited to find that the album was available on CD.  Was surprised that the song "Praise the Lord" was not included in the album.  The song is great, and I hope that I can find a different copy on CD.  I listened to it a couple of times while at work on my lunch break.  I thought it was a good song.  I like the vocal.

Amazon review: I bought one of these CDs and I have been very impressed so far with the quality of the CD.  I was not expecting a good CD to start with.  I would like to see if the CD would be any better if I played it through the CD player.  I don't know if anyone has tried that, but I would like to know.  I listened to this CD for about an hour and then had to go on break.  I hope someone can tell me if this CD is any better than the CD I bought at Walmart.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Casting Crowns and have really enjoyed this CD.  I purchased it to listen to when I was on break at work, and it has just been a great listen.  I have to say I was a little disappointed with this CD.  I thought they would have included more songs on this CD.  I am very glad I bought it.  I will look for the other CD's to compare and decide if I will purchase the CDs.

Amazon review: I purchased this album thinking that I would enjoy it, but the song "My Love" by Casting Crowns is so sad.  I thought it was a pretty great song, but the lyrics are so sad that it completely ruined the song.  I do not want to listen to this song.  It makes me feel like I am back in elementary school.  This is probably the most disappointing CD I have ever listened to.  It is just sad.  The lyrics are pretty bad.  I don't think I can give this album a positive review, but I would like to know if anyone else has heard this.
