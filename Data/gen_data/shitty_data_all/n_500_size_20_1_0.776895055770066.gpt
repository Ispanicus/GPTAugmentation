Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I think it's best to compare it against the original for the full effect of the song.  The lyrics don't really change much, but the song does a better job of playing off the words.  There are a few better lines here than the one you'll find on the album, but overall it's great, and I love the way they made the song flow.  It's definitely a song that I'll be listening to over and over again, and will even play it for my kids when they come over.

Amazon review: Well, well, well, this is a great version of a very popular song from the 1940's.  It's a bit of a mystery why the singer wasn't credited, as he was a well-known actor.  I don't know that I'd care to buy a CD with a singer that I didn't know was a singer from the 1940's, but it's a good version of the song.  The chorus is fun, and the piano part isn't too bad either.  The song is just a little bit too long, though, so I'd recommend listening to the version the album comes with.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a terrific, fun, and enjoyable little piece of music.  I thought the vocals were very good, and the piano was well done.  The song is great for a change of pace from other songs on the album.  It is a song that I could listen to over and over and never tire of.

Amazon review: This is one of the better covers of a song ever done, and it's good.  It's a good version of a song that is kind of a standard.  I would have been happy with just the original version, but they've made the original sound a little better, and this is a good compromise by the way.  It's a song that would have been great if sung by a singer from the 1940's.  I don't know why it wasn't, though.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Music

Tac and Hash's album "Numb" (ABiCA Records) is a musical journey through the mind at 3am, when they were young and in love.  "Numb" is a hard-hitting, angry and personal album that is a solid musical representation of the band's sound.  The first thing I noticed about the album is that there is no filler, and there is no filler.  That's a good thing.

The music is well-written.  There are good songs on here.  They are fast and sharp and very different from their previous releases.  The lyrics are also good.  They are passionate.  The two frontmen, Tac and Hash, have a great chemistry together, which makes this a very enjoyable listen.

The production on the album is excellent.  There are no cheap tricks used here.  The songs are well-recorded, and the production is solid.

If you like rap-rock music, then you should definitely check out this album.  If you like it, then you'll like it, and hopefully you'll want to buy the next one.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I guess technically it's a tribute album to the songwriting of Richard Wright, but this is actually a collection of songs that were cut from the original albums that Richard Wright recorded.  From what I hear, this is like trying to put together a collection of songs from the Beatles catalog except the Beatles wrote a lot of their best songs in their early, more experimental days.  So, by the time they got a full band together, they were able to write a lot of their best songs.  So, when they recorded one, they thought, "That's it!"  But, they never got to write those songs again.  They may have been able to record some other songs from the same album (which is why some of the songs seem to have been recorded by the same band), but they would have probably been left with some filler.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first time I heard the Pink Floyd album 'Wish You Were Here' I was captivated by the song 'Meddle'.  Later, I heard it on my iPod and I can still hear the melody in my head, just a few bars, but the words and the arrangement are completely different.  I remember going into the studio and thinking that I wanted to do my own version (which is why I chose to record my own version of Wish You Were Here) and then I heard this album and knew I had to get it.

Amazon review: I know I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, but I found this CD to be a waste of time.  The songs are decent, but the vocals are awful.

Amazon review: Wow, what a great idea! I was really surprised and delighted that I had stumbled upon a Pink Floyd CD (I've been a fan since the early days of the band).

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: An awesome album for all people of the world.  It is a great album to listen to in the car while driving or driving late at night while you are trying to sleep.  Very impressive voice.  Very inspiring and uplifting.  I like the concept.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This song is about someone who is in love with a man and he is the head of the family.  The woman is the wife of the man and she is in love with him.  The man has a mistress.  The song is full of a sense of longing that just begs us to listen to and appreciate the powerful emotions being played out in this song.  I love the concept of the song.  It is a great album to listen to when you are alone on a Sunday afternoon while drinking a glass of wine and watching the birds outside.  You don't have to talk to the person who is singing, but when it is quiet, you can just sit back and listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  The first song on the album,  "The Man You've Married" is about a man who is in love with his wife and she is in love with the man.  She says that she is not in love with the man but she is just infatuated with him.  I thought it was very original and very meaningful.  The lyrics are very meaningful as well.  This is one of my favorites on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the first song on the album, "The Man You've Married".  The man is in love with his wife and he has been trying to win her heart.  She was not in love with him, but she is infatuated with him.  The husband is the head of the family.  The wife is the wife of the man.  He has a mistress.  The song is about how men usually don't like to admit their mistakes.  They try to deny it and they try to cover up their mistakes.  They try to be a hero.  Women usually don't like that, they don't want to be a hero and they don't want to feel like a victim of the situation.  This song is about the woman in the song.  She is in love with the man.  He has a mistress.  She has a lot of pride.  She doesn't want to be a victim.  She wants to be a hero.  She doesn't want to just fall for the man.  She wants to fight for him and win him.  She wants to be the man's heroine.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  The second song on the album is called "In the Midst of My Pain".  This is about a man and his mistress.  He loves his mistress.  They have been together for 25 years.  He has had many girlfriends but he has never been the father of any children.  She is a beautiful woman.  She is intelligent and she is very strong-willed.  She is very independent and she likes to take care of herself.  When she is by herself, she is very strong.  She is also very beautiful.  She is strong and she is very independent.  I thought the whole concept of the song was very interesting.  I thought the guy was very wise in his decision to have a mistress.  He was able to put his past behind him and he is in love with the woman.  I thought the song was very powerful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  The third song on the album is called "The Man You've Married".  It is about a woman who is in love with a man that is the head of the family.  She is the wife of the man.  She is in love with the man.  He has a lover.  The man has a mistress.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I would like this song to not be so annoying. It really doesn't sound like a song I like. I'm usually quite a fan of the jukebox songs, but this one is so annoying. It's just a bunch of little annoying sounds that are repeated over and over. I don't know if I'm more annoyed by the song, or the fact that I'm constantly having to listen to it over and over again. It's one of those songs that if someone played it at my house they would have to get the house smelling like burning dog because of the smell of burning dog. The other songs on this album are actually better, but I really can't stand this song.

In an effort to spread the word about this great band, and to let others know that they are still around and still performing.

This is the second CD to be released from the band, and the third release to be made available for digital download.

The band consists of singer/guitarist, James F. Smith, guitarist, Michael J. O'Neill, bassist, David K. Miller, and drummer, John L. Miller, and they play a sound that has become very popular since the release of their first album, "This is America". The music is very up-tempo and energetic while still keeping a very "country" sound.

The CD is packaged in a slip case with a 12" by 12" poster, and the CD that was made available for digital download.

If you have never listened to this band or this song before, please, please

Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.
