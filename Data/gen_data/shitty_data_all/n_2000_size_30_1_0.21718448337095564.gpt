Amazon review: A beautiful song, a hymn of earlier days, and who better to do it than Fernando Ortega? The one-star review really shouldn't be included as it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose, but rather an accident on someone's part. This song deserves 5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Amazon review: I've heard quite a few of these tracks. The album they're on is one of the all time favorites of mine. I own every CD cover, both the CD and LP versions and love them all. I've been listening to "Love, Lost & Found" for years now, both as a song and with other artists.

Amazon review: A great album, one of my favorites of the 90s and one of the best albums of all time. It's one of the few records that I can listen to and have a real emotional reaction to as the album is so beautiful and just so touching. The songs are perfect and everyone sings the songs so well to the point where you can really hear the emotion and beauty of the music.

Amazon review: This song was absolutely horrible! It was very distasteful and lacked structure. I do not recommend this song for anyone. In fact, if every CD Nick Lowe made exploded, I wouldn't have a problem! It's terrible. Do not buy or get this song! WARNING WARNING don't buy!

Amazon review: This one didn't blow me away. But I still thought it was pretty damn good. I don't really know much about Nick's early sound, so for me, this doesn't stand out as a big improvement, but it's a step in the right direction. I would like to see more of his older work.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the Nick Lowe's solo albums and I thought this one was pretty damn good. I mean, it's a Nick Lowe album, so it's not gonna be great, but this was his best effort.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was a Nick Lowe fan that was in the market for a few new Nick Lowe album and thought it might be a good one. The album is pretty good.

First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million.

It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split.

The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.

Amazon review:  I am going to start with all the negative things I have heard about this album.  I am not going to address the album itself because no matter what you hear, you will be entertained.  This album is great, there is no doubt about it.  I have been listening to this album for about 6 months now and I still find myself listening to it at least once a day.  But there are a few things I can say that are negative.  First, the CD's are very clear and you can hear everything there is to hear.  Also, it has a very cheesy sound to it, which is one of the things I dislike most about the CD's.  I don't know why I like this album so much, all I know is I do.  I don't know why I like it so much, I know just as well as anyone else that it is a little generic, very much like the sound of the record company.  The only positive thing about this album is that it does not try to sell its self as a Christmas album, it is a totally different kind of album.  The only thing I have to say about this album is that it is a little boring.  It does, however, make you smile every time you hear it.  If you really like Christmas and have never heard this album, then go out and buy it.  It is worth your time.  The title says it all, "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."  You will enjoy this album, I've been listening to it for about a week now and I still hear something new each time.  I am going to stop ranting because I have to get ready for work, and also, this is my 3rd review.  I hope that it will be the last one.

Amazon review: Let me break this down, in a rather incomplex fashion, for all who are either considering the purchase of this CD or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan.  Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.

Amazon review: I have been buying this CD since the first day it came out. I was in high school in the late eighties I can remember hearing Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" on the radio and being inspired immediately. I always knew that I had to buy this CD, as it was the only CD I had ever heard by them. When I first heard it, it was just okay, but after listening to it several more times, I realized that this album was a masterpiece that was not to be missed. I have since listened to every Nirvana album, but this one is by far my favorite. This album is a must for any fan of rock and roll.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.

It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

Amazon review: This "artist" leaves a lot to be desired.  I actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind.  But I found myself not being able to get past the first thirty seconds.  It is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly passes for music today.  Save your money or get it on bootleg.  Personally I wouldn't take this for free.  Add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thieves, cop killers, drug addicts and ex cons.

Amazon review: Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.

I bought this because the artist is Lenny Kravitz. Well, I have a problem with this. I believe the album is actually by Lenny Kravitz and that this album was actually produced by Lenny Kravitz. That is how I know that this album is produced by Lenny Kravitz and not by someone else. There are not many songs on this album that are produced by Lenny Kravitz. I don't know anything about LK or any of his songs. I didn't know that Lenny Kravitz was a great singer. I didn't know that he's an amazing guitar player. I was very surprised that he has a good voice and talent when I first heard him sing. I also didn't know that he had a cool song on here. But, I didn't know that the album was a good album. I did not know it was a good album until after I made my purchase. I didn't know that the song "Crazy Crazy" was good when I first heard it. I am just a little disappointed that I am not satisfied with this album. I know that some of the songs on here are good, but that's all. I didn't think that this album was a great album until after I had made my purchase. I didn't like the album until I had made my purchase.

Amazon review: Manakin Moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band Waxing Poetics, who were a regional favorite in the Norfolk, Virginia, area.  It's a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind.  Highly recommended.  Wannabe singers, just try to learn the lyrics on this one!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside.

Amazon review: It's a pretty song, with great vocals, but I'm not sure about the lyrics/message. Once I downloaded and listened to it in it's entirety I was displeased- sounds rather morbid to me. Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas. Is it just me, or do the selections this year seem kind of lousy thus far? I really enjoyed this 25 days of free downloads advent-type "calendar" last year.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

Amazon review: T.C. Ellis had a brief part in Prince's "Graffiti Bridge" (the album and the movie).  His delivery was excellent, so I was truly looking forward to his solo debut. Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".

Amazon review: Thie album is pretty good, Redneck Crazy is by far the best song. I would not buy music from amazon again. Have to use their player to down load and it is crap. Have to pa 25 a year to add your tracks to it if you have over 250

Amazon review: An easy to listen to album with a great selection of songs.  The vocals are good, the guitars are nice, and there is good diversity in the band.  The songs have a good feel and the band members are good.  The song "Walking Dead" has a catchy chorus and the song "Stumble" is a good song.  The songs "Walking Dead" and "Miss Thang" are both good songs.  The album is an easy listen to but is not for everyone.  I would recommend this album if you need a good selection of music.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: The cd was just okay.  I'm from Chicago and I love house music but this was kinda lame.  A lot of the songs sound alike but the bass is booming!  I'm a dancer and I can only use about 3 of the 12 tracks.  I'm glad it didn't cost a lot.

Amazon review: I don't normally give a poor review. I'm more likely to lean toward average or better. The product is fine. plays well, no issues at all. The problem I have is that I didn't get it for over 24 hours. I think today you should be able to purchase a song on-line and be able to play it then and there. I ended up buying this elsewhere because I got tired of waiting. I won't buy music from Amazon anymore. but I'll still buy everything else!

Amazon review: I bought this because I loved the title.  I figured they would have the same song on all the compilations for that title.  This certainly isn't the case.  They have a lot of different songs on each section and it took me a while to find it.  I would have paid twice this amount to have the song on a compilation with the original artist's name on it, not just the generic name.

Amazon review: This is a very good compilation of the best songs from the 60s to the 90s.  You won't find many new songs here, but the ones you do find are very good.  I had no problems with the songs I played.  The bass was not too hot, but the drums were excellent.

Amazon review: This is a great collection of Jim Reeves songs all of which are great, but I have the feeling we are going to hear the same songs over and over again on this one.  I like the songs that Jim Reeves wrote, but I can't get over the fact that this compilation is only 2 1/2 hours long.

Amazon review: This is the best collection of Jim Reeves songs ever.  I own every one that I have found.  I love the ones that are from the 60s and the ones that are from the 70s and the 90s.  I was very happy to find a Jim Reeves song from his early days that I had never heard.  It is great that there are versions of songs from different periods of his career.  I think the only reason that I don't think we are going to hear the same songs over and over again is because over the years the songs get better and better.  I still like some of the other songs but I think I have put some other songs to the back of my mind.  I will still buy the cd because I love Jim Reeves' songs.  I will buy this cd again when he is still alive and well.  I think the cd is worth it.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Jim Reeves.  I have all his CDs and I have been listening to them for quite a few years.  I am still amazed with the way he writes his songs or the way he plays the guitar.  I have always thought that it would be amazing to have a cd of all the best songs from all time.  This is it.  I think this is the best cd out there by Jim Reeves and I will buy it again when he is still alive.

Amazon review: What's not to love about this cd?  It consists of songs from all eras of Jim Reeves.  Of course, the CD doesn't include all the songs of Jim Reeves, but that's what makes this cd great.  I was happy to find Jim Reeves songs in the middle of the CD because I am a big fan of his songs.  I love the songs that he wrote and the songs that he plays.  I love the way he plays his guitar and the way he sings too.

You won't hear many new Jim Reeves songs on this cd, but the ones you do hear are great.  I'm really excited to hear all the songs on this cd.  I love Jim Reeves and I think I can't wait to hear all of his songs.  I love this cd.  I will buy it again when he is still alive and well.

Amazon review: Skillet has been around for a while now and have put out a number of great albums. They have one of the best live sets on the market and their music is very entertaining.  I recommend giving this a try.  This is for fans of the band.  They have a great album out and will be on store shelves soon.  You can download a few tracks from the band's website but you'll have to buy the actual album if you want to get everything.  This is a great album to purchase if you're looking for a fun, upbeat album.  It's worth the money.  The band is going through a bit of a rough time, so I wouldn't recommend buying anything from this album unless you're familiar with the band or have already bought their albums. It's a great album and if you're looking for a great album, this is it.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Skillet since I was 13 or so. I love this band and never really thought about buying anything from them before. I am so glad I bought this album.  I love the songs they put out and I have been listening to this album nonstop.  It's hard to find a band that has been around for so long that puts out albums as good as this one.  My favorite Skillet song is the title track.  If you like the band and want to hear some good music, buy this album.  It's hard to find a band that puts out albums as good as this one.

Amazon review:  This cd is a must for any David Arkenstone fan.  David Arkenstone is, without a doubt, the greatest songwriter of all time.  His voice is so pure and real that you can't put a finger on where the lyrics come from.  It is as if he is singing directly to you and he does that in such a beautiful way.  This album features an incredible collection of songs that include "The Dream Is Over," "You're Never Weird," "Trouble," "Breeze Into My Arms," "On The Way Up," "Bare of the Eyes," "The World Is a Nightmare," and "The World Keeps Turning."  The music is great and the lyrics are also great.  David Arkenstone will always be remembered for his songs "The Dream Is Over," "You're Never Weird," and "Trouble."  This cd is also a must for fans of the late David Arkenstone, especially his best songs.
