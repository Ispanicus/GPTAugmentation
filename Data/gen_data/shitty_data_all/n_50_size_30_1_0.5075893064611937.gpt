Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a nice, easy listening CD from a group who does worship music with a very positive message.  The vocals, by an individual, are a little too high in the mix.  The music is very pleasant enough to listen to and a nice change from the usual pop-rock that most Christian music is filled with.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been looking for a good Christian rock or R&B CD that is not overly overproduced, and this one fits the bill.  The music is very "clean" sounding, but not in a way that is distracting.  I like the mix and feel of the songs, and the harmonies are nice and varied.  Also, the lyrics are positive.  All in all, this CD is a nice addition to my collection.  I'm going to add it to my "to buy" list.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:          I was really disappointed in this album.  I liked the album when I first bought it, but after going through the whole album, it just doesn't hold up.  I think the album could be much better because of the poor mixing, but the songs are nice and the music is very good.  The only thing that really bothers me is the vocals.  The person singing the female lead vocals just sounds like a little kid.  The music is a little slow, but that's to be expected.  I think this album could have been much better, but would still be a great CD to purchase if it was just about the music and not about the lead singer.

Amazon review:   I have had this CD for a while in my car.  It is a CD that I have listened to many times.  This CD is very good.  There is one song (Dawn of the Day) that is very catchy and it is easy to sing along to.  The words are positive and the music is pleasant.  I really enjoy listening to this CD.  I have been listening to it in my car, at Bible study, and at my home.  It is also very good to listen to when I am taking a walk or running errands in the morning.

Amazon review: This CD is a Christian rock CD that is very positive.   I like this CD because the songs are nice and the singing is good.  The songs are fun and the music is good and the lyrics are positive.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Christian rock music.

Amazon review: This CD really has some really nice songs on it.  This CD is good for a Christian rock-type of CD.  I am a Christian and I like to listen to Christian music.  This CD is good for that kind of CD.  I like the music on this CD and the lyrics are positive.  The music is good as well and the songs on this CD are all very nice.  You can really tell that the songs were written by real Christians.  I like the songs on this CD, but I would like the songs to be a little longer.  I like the songs that are on this CD to be about 2-3 minutes long.  That is what I like to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The CD I purchased was a CD that I was looking for.  It is not a Christian music CD at all.  The CD I purchased was just a generic CD that was a good CD to listen to.  The CD that I purchased is about 5 minutes long.  The songs are good and the music is very good.  The CD was good as well, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.  I would recommend this CD to listen to only if you want to listen to a generic CD that is good to listen to.

I write short stories, which I call "books" (because I do not know how to make a book). The stories I am currently working on are in the following genres:

Shorts:

The first short story I wrote was about a man who was an evil, selfish, racist, anti-feminist, and anti-gay person who would do anything to avoid having to be around a woman. He was an alcoholic, a drug addict, and a liar. He was constantly getting himself into trouble with the law and would get himself into jail. He would lie on the stand so much that he would make any woman uncomfortable in court. When he got out of jail he had no job, nowhere to live, and no money. He could not have sex with anyone as he had no money and no place to live. I thought there was something wrong with this person and I wanted to see him suffer. He was a perfect example of the way people can go wrong in life.

The second short story I wrote was about an abused woman who had to be rescued from a situation she

I haven't been able to download the second CD, and I really want to listen to it, but the link keeps redirecting me to Amazon.com.  How can I access the song from Amazon.com?  It doesn't allow me to download.  I can download songs from Amazon.com, but I don't want to download songs from Amazon.com.

A:

You are probably not actually linking to the song you want on Amazon, but instead referring to the song "Hall and Oats".
That means that you are referring to the album Hall and Oats and the song "Mermaids".
That is not possible because Amazon does not allow you to download any song, not even from Amazon.com, with a link.
But you can use the link http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Hall+and+Oats+&x=0&y=0 to download the song "Mermaids" from Amazon.com, but then you can only play it on Amazon.com.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The album is good however, I would expect more from the guys I listen to.  The first song off the album, "The Day Is Done" is a good example as it consists of a few fast verses followed by a few slower ones.  I would expect more from the boys I listen to.  As for the rest of the album, I could care less.  I am not a fan of this group at all.

Amazon review: This is a decent album, but it is nothing compared to the previous album.  The songs themselves are nothing special.  The songs on this album are mediocre at best.

A Collection of Some of the Best Songs on the Entire CD.

A collection of some of the best songs on the entire CD.

I've been listening to this cd for about a week now. I like the new songs, like the first one. However, I do not like the rest of it. It is boring and repetitive. There are only four songs from the two original cd's that are included, and all of them are the same four songs over and over again. I have also heard that this cd has the same four songs in the beginning of each cd. I hope that this cd does not get a 5 star rating because I have not heard any of the other cds that this cd is taken from.

I have been buying vinyl records for over 20 years and have listened to many cd's before, but this is the first cd that is not a good cd.

I would recommend this cd to people who want to listen to music and not a cd that is a waste of time.

I bought this cd from Amazon as a gift for a friend. I received it in a very fast delivery. It came with 2 of the 4 songs (and 1 of the 3 that I was wanting) and all the songs that I mentioned above. I would say that it is as good as the second cd, but much better than the first.

I am a very happy customer and would recommend this cd to everyone. It's worth the money.

This is a very good cd. I had been looking for something with more variety. This cd does not have the same four songs over and over again. I like the first song, "I love you just the way you are", in the beginning. It reminds me of when I was younger. I would recommend this cd to anyone. It is a very good cd.

I have been listening to this cd for about a week now. I like the first one, but the rest do not really stick to me. I have heard that this cd has the same four songs in the beginning of each CD. I hope that this cd does not get a 5 star rating because i have not heard any of the other cds that this cd is taken off of.

I have been buying vinyl records for over 20 years and my friends and family members have all been telling me that this CD sounds like an old cd, but it is great music and is worth $9.00. I would recommend this cd to anyone interested in good music.

I was excited to get this cd from Amazon because I love music. I had been looking really hard for something to listen to while I was on vacation and the cd did not disappoint. I love that it has the same four songs over and over. I like the first song, "I love you just the way YOU are", in the beginning and it reminded me of when I was younger. I would recommend this cd to anyone, especially people who are looking for good music.

I have been listening to this cd for about a week and a half now and I have been very happy with it. It has been very good to my ears. It has been easy to listen to and I like the fact that there are so many different songs on it. The only thing I don't like is that it is repetitive. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music.

I will be buying this cd in the near future. It is a very good cd. I have enjoyed it so much that i will be buying it again. It has been very good to my ears. It has been easy and enjoyable to listen to. I have been buying vinyl records for over 20 years and in all my years of music I have never had a cd that I have listened to over and over again. I would recommend this cd to anyone who loves music.

I have been listening to this cd for about a month now and I really like it. I don't really know how I never got around to this cd when I first bought it. I have been looking for something new to listen to and not the same cd over and over again. I have been listening to this cd for a long time and I have enjoyed it. I really like the songs on this cd and I don't really like the song at the beginning of the cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone.

I have been buying vinyl records for over 20 years and in all my years music I have never

We just got to know the new single from Jewel and it is a good tune. I don't know why people don't like her. She is a good singer. I really like her music. I think her music is better than others.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I do not like the song choices of this album.  I thought the album is very short for a cd.

I think the arranger and choral leader should have more songs to choose from.

I had to stop and listen to these songs.  I really really did not listen to this CD until after I had listened to the first few songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing! I have heard many vocal trainers out there but I was not satisfied by how they were training my voice. So, I had to find a good one. But the one I chose is a great trainer. Her voice is so beautiful and soft that you can't help but worship her. She does it all to perfection and she is not only great at voice training, but also great at singing. You can't help but be inspired by her. I feel like she is God's voice and I will be forever a fan of hers. I have now started practicing in the shower and after two days, my voice has improved and I am so thankful.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

"I would not recommend this to someone who isn't into the band."

A:

I would say that the album is not bad: it is the sound quality that is the problem.
"I have a friend that is into this band" - this is the only thing you can be sure: I don't know whether he is into this band because of the sound quality.
The whole album is full of "weird" music and "off" music, that sounds to be composed of the kind of music that is sung by someone that is not into the band.
It doesn't look like it's a real band. It looks more like a bunch of musicians who had the idea to make a band and then got together and made their own music. 
Personally, as a musician, I don't like that kind of music. The band sound is not bad, but it has the typical characteristics of "alternative music". I would rate this as 4.5/10.

A:

This is a really good album.  There is some very good music on this disc.  The problem is that it is not nearly as good as it could be.
It's unfortunate that "I would not recommend this to someone who isn't into the band" is a valid statement.  This does not make this album bad; it makes it an average album. 
The album has a lot of very good songs, and almost all of them are good.  But I would rate it a 6.5/10 or even a 7/10.  The reason I would give it a 6.5/10 is because the songs are very average.  They are okay, but they don't really stand out.  It is not a bad album, but it is not a very good album either.  It is not bad, but it is not a great album either.  The album is more of an average album than it is a great album.
It is not bad, but it is not great.

 All songs are by the same members of the band.  The main difference is in the songs "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" and "I Am a Loser".

  even consider this CD a "recommendation".

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection and the only thing I wish the collection had was a couple of songs that would have been cut out at the last minute.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I've been a fan of this band since I first heard them in the mid 1980's. They were at the top of the "new indie" music scene with their songwriting, dynamic harmonies, and strong vocals. Now, a decade later, they are still going strong and are as popular as ever.  It's a shame that this CD was not as well received as it should have been.  I am sure they would have had a larger market had they been able to sell this CD on their own merits. I give them a 2.5 out of 5 stars for this CD.  I know some will think I am crazy but I believe in a higher power. I believe that this CD has been given to me to remind me of the good times, the good songs, and the important lyrics that made my life worthwhile.  Some will think I am crazy. I am not a big fan of this band, but I am a big fan of the world, and I believe in a higher power. I believe that this CD has been sent to me to remind me that I am not alone in my beliefs.  They are still going strong.  They have their own fans and they will continue to tour and write and music.  I will continue to share their music and hope that one day I can meet them.  I have a feeling that I will be very fortunate to meet them.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer's assessment of this album.  I didn't like the first CD, but the second album seemed to be better.  I bought the CD after listening to it again.  However, I have to say I can't imagine any song that didn't have a positive message.  It's not one of those "I know it's not what I want to hear" albums.  I can't imagine listening to this album without having a positive message.  The songs have been put together for a reason, I just don't know what it was.  I gave it a 3 star rating because I can't imagine listening to this without having a positive message.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The only bad thing I can think of is that they have a lot of different styles.  I know that it's different for different people, but I can't imagine listening to this album without a positive message.  I give them a 4 out of 5 stars for this album.  I think it's a good song-writing album and that's all that matters.  I also think the message is positive, but I still don't know what the message is.  I don't think they have a message, so I don't know if they are being positive, or negative.  My problem is that I'm not sure what the message is.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars for this album.  I hope to see them again.

Amazon review: I bought this album after being introduced to them on the radio.  I found their music to be a refreshing change from the "hits" on the pop music stations.  I liked the first album, but not as much as the second album.  The second album seems to have a more "full" sound and overall it gives an excellent representation of their music.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars for this album for the positive message, but I can't say that I know what the message is from listening to it.  I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because I can't really say what the message is from listening to it, but I can say that it doesn't suck.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars for this album because I'm not sure what the message is, and I don't really care.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars for this album, because I can't find any negative.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars for this album and hope to see them again.  I give them a 3 out of 5 stars for this album just because I can't find anything negative about it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: A must, for anyone with a good ear.  Schubert's music is not for everyone but it is hard to find a better recording of his music.  I am also a fan of the opera, and this recording is not bad.  I have to say that if you are a fan of Schubert and want to hear his music, this is a good place to start.  I would recommend this music to anyone.  I would also recommend Schubert's music to anyone.  It is hard to find better recordings of his music.

Amazon review: His work is very good and it is hard to find a better recording of his work.  He is known for his slow tempo, and he plays this music with a tempo that is very slow.  There are some of his pieces where it is easy to play them on piano, but there are some where it is hard to play them on piano.  I would recommend this music to anyone who wants to hear some of his music.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I love the first CD.  This one is disappointing.  They seem to have stopped caring about the music.  There seems to be little to no emotion.  I don't mean no emotion, just not too much of it.  They seem to have turned their back on what made this group so interesting.  I like when a band does something new, but this group seems to have turned away from that.  They have been boring, and I'm not impressed.

Amazon review: This album is a bit boring.  It's not really different from what I've heard previously.

I just wish they could have tried something different rather than just repeating the same routine.
