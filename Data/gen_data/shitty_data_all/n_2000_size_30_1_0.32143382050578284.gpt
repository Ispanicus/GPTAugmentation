Amazon review: Heard this on a movie and really dug the lyrics. Haven't really listened to it since I downloaded it. The intro was too long for me, and I don't like the vocals they are shaky like there is hardly any talent. Once I heard the whole song the lyrics aren't as impressive as when i heard it on the movie.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.

Amazon review: I think it's a shame that they have their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity. This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better. I am very bitter about the $15 I gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of electronic music at all. However, this is a great mix of electronica, folk, and electronic, and I really enjoy the variety of songs and even though I'm not sure if it's electronic, it's definitely in the electronica side of the spectrum.

Amazon review: This cd just doesn't work for me. I was really disappointed by the quality of the recording and the amount of time spent in the studio and the quality of the songs, which are great, but the production is terrible.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Usually when you see a CD of little known tunes from the classic era of R&B, you're in for some rare treasures. This is NOT one of those kinds of CD's. The tunes are almost to a one poorly recorded, poorly performed, and lacking in appealing hooks. This is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know about this. The disc was all songs from the Beatles and was made in 1977. The only tracks that I can recall hearing from the Beatles that were on the disc were "Drive My Car" or "She Came In Through the Bathroom Window". The only discs I can think of that were all Beatles are the ones that came with the Beatles Anthology.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this would be an interesting one. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a mess. The mix of old and new is a bit off putting, but the selection is great. The most interesting tracks are the ones that could have been on the original album but weren't. The only track that could have been on the original album is "A Day In The Life" which is only on this CD. "A Day In The Life" is a nice tune that has never been recorded and could have been on the original album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I picked this up at a thrift store while on vacation in Austin, TX. I was looking for an old album, and this was the only album with a label that I could locate. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the recordings. This is a great collection of the first wave of R&B.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is another one of those CDs that sounds great and yet is a bit out of place. I was just looking for a good R&B album and this was the only one that I could find. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound. The disc starts out with a nice little tune called "One Way Ticket" which is actually on the original album. The first disc is a bit of a mess but nothing too bad, and the second disc is great! The first disc is a compilation of the best tracks from the first album, I like the sound of the live recordings but the songs seem to be from the studio albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not very familiar with the recording industry from a historical standpoint, but from what I have seen when I listen to this CD, this was one of the most commercially successful albums of the first wave of R&B. This CD has a great mix of all the different eras of the first wave of R&B artists. This is a great CD to have on your collection.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a compilation of the best tracks from the first wave of R&B. The disc contains an interesting mix of original studio recordings and live performances. I found this CD interesting as it contained a mix of the most popular and best-selling recording artists of the late 1960's. Although the songs are not all of the best original artists, they are all of the best-selling originals. This is a great compilation of the best R&B in history!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The disc was so good I bought it twice. I must admit that I am a bit disappointed with the mix of the songs on the disc.

The disc started out with "A Day in the Life," which was a nice little tune that was originally on the first album. The first disc was a mix of the best of the best.

Amazon review: I have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 as a member of brogian bards and independent solo artist and have never heard something that I didn't like and usually loved  Marc Gunn is talented in many different hats such as podcaster for Celtic music in many different formats  listen to him again and again  as he always makes you feel ultimately good  even his death song album. his takes and twists on scifi and parody are among the best

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.

Amazon review: I was big tyme disappointed by this album.  Bluntly speaking, it is a major deviation from the stylistic sounds that characterize singles Western Ways or Killing Time, or Waisters and Melted on the Blunted CD. If you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop tracks of the other singles, then stop searching for this CD right now.  This CD is straight commercial and the style is done already.  If you want to hear the sounds on this CD in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old Soul II Soul.

Amazon review: So i know there are two dirty words in the song and i wanted the clean version (that you hear on the radio) so i could listen to it even if my child pops into the room. but instead of using another word like the radio edit. this one uses cartoon effects. very weird and just as you are getting into the song that pops up. wish i wouldnt have bought this one.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a couple of weeks now, and I'm really enjoying it. I am a big fan of the more raw and less processed sound of Frank Sinatra and his band. I would describe "My Christmas Feeling" as a mix of "Merry Christmas" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" with Sinatra's vocals more prominent. It's a good way to get this one into your car.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

If you are not a fan of Dave Holland, Chick Corea, and Anthony Braxton then you'll hate this album. Anthony Braxton's music is not for everyone and I think that this album is not the greatest album that he has ever made. If you are a fan of Chick Corea and Dave Holland then you are in for a treat.

I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

Amazon review: I have a hard time finding any live albums of Paul Simon and yet I am very happy to have found this one. I've been a Paul Simon fan for over 40 years and have yet to find an album that captures his creativity in an album. This one is good and well produced. I don't have anything negative to say about this. My only advice is to take it out and listen to it on your own and let it be your own experience.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This new live album is different from the previous one. It is not a new Paul Simon album. It is actually a different concept, with only three songs, I don't know if that's a good thing or not. It is a live recording of the Paul Simon/Stephen Sondheim show at the London Palladium. There is an interview with Stephen Sondheim on the first page of the CD, which I find very interesting. I think it's going to be a great CD. The songs "The Sun Never Sets" and "I Hope You're Happy" are both great songs, but "The Old Grey Lady" and "In the Middle" are not my favorites. The other songs are very good, but I think "In the Middle" could have been done better. If the next live album is going to be a live recording of the same show, then you may have a good album. I have to give it a 4 stars, but if you don't, then it's not a bad CD.

Amazon review: I've heard this live album before, and I was very disappointed. I was waiting for Paul Simon to release a new live album, one where he sounded better than in the last few years.

I hope to improve on this one, but I have to give it 4 stars.

His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.

There are some really bad lyrics and I'm afraid this album is going to be another disappointment.  I will say it has potential though.

Amazon review: I'm going to have to agree with the two previous reviews for Ace Stills. It is like listening to a tape of a much better artist instead of a real live performance.  He is just not up to the task of being in a band.  The song writing is not bad, it is just that he is not up to the task of being a singer.  I am not surprised by his age because he has played music for years.  He just is not up to the task of being a singer.  He may be a great song writer and singer, but not a singer.  I guess the problem is that he needs to sing.  He is not the type of person who gets up and gives his all at the time.  I really like the song "You're So Good To Me."  It is a nice ballad with a cool groove.  I think if he sang this song without a band it would be better.  I would like to see him sing this song with a band.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs.  It really is a great song.  I have listened to it numerous times and it is just so much fun.  It is just so much fun.  I have also listened to the song "You're So Good to Me" and the song is very nice also.  I think the band does a nice job on the song and the band is pretty good on it.  I was impressed with all of the band members.  I don't know if it is just me, but I thought the song was missing something, but I just couldn't put my finger on it.  All of the band members are very talented and I think that they have done a nice job on this song.  I think they have done a great job on the song.  I am not sure why the song is missing something.  There is just something about it.  Something that just doesn't work.  I don't know what it is.  I would have to listen to it again to figure it out.  It is just so damn good.  I really think this song is one of my favorites.  I love it a lot.  I would love to hear this song sung by Ace Stills.  I hope he plays it with a band.  It would be an amazing song.  It would be so cool.  I would love to hear it.  I would also love to hear it played by Ace Stills and the band.  I hope he plays it with a band.  It is such a cool song.  I would love to see Ace Stills play this song with a band.  I hope he plays this song with a band and the band is good.  I hope Ace Stills plays this song with a band.  I hope Ace Stills plays this song with a band.

Amazon review: After listening to the previews on Amazon I decided to buy the actual CD. I've always liked DJ Shadow, and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was making now (in 2016).  It is typical Shadow ambiances and found sounds, but some tracks have wildly swung broken beat patterns like Flying Lotus and the like. A few tracks attempt a dubstep feel, but it comes across as plodding. A couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns and tripleted patterns.

Amazon review: It's a pretty song, with great vocals, but I'm not sure about the lyrics/message. Once I downloaded and listened to it in it's entirety I was displeased- sounds rather morbid to me. Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas. Is it just me, or do the selections this year seem kind of lousy thus far? I really enjoyed this 25 days of free downloads advent-type "calendar" last year.

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies. Tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra Bonus for us!

Amazon review: Possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie.  This soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie.  Nothing fancy. Just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with Tim McIntire's great voice fits perfectly with the time period.  A perfect example of how less can be far more effective.

Amazon review: I am a vocal man, so I have always admired Christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music, why is it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this song mean, during my era of music it was pretty simple. Journey. Lovin',Touchin', Squeezin', pretty simple huh. Def Leppard. Pour Some Sugar On Me, no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about!

Amazon review: If you are looking for a soundtrack to your next movie, then this is it!  As a fan of music, I can appreciate that there is always a need for a great soundtrack, but I have to be honest and say that I am not a fan of the music in the movie I am watching.  The music never really fits in with the movie or adds to the movie.  The music never really makes you feel like you are right in the movie, but then again it may be because you are not.  This track is one of the best I have heard in a while.  I have had the pleasure of seeing this movie and I have come to the conclusion that maybe I am not the target audience for this movie.  But I am a massive fan of the song and I can appreciate the fact that it was created to promote the movie, not to make you feel like you are watching the movie.  So I give this soundtrack a thumbs up!

Amazon review: If you like music like I do, you'll love this soundtrack.  It does exactly what it sets out to do, make you feel like you are in the movie.  It's pretty fun and it's easy to listen to, but it does have a lot to say.  The only negative thing I can say about this soundtrack is that if you are looking for a great soundtrack, this is not it.  There are so many great soundtrack that are much better than this one.

Amazon review: This soundtrack is a great collection of songs and one of my favorites.  If you like music like me, this is a must have.

I am not a huge horror fan, but I will say that there are some great horror movies that are not that good and this movie does a amazing job at what it does.

Amazon review: I enjoy all kinds of music, but have never been much for country music.  This CD is a good example of how good country music can be.  It is nice to have a soundtrack that doesn't sound like what you are expecting, but what you get is very good.  There are a few songs that could have been cut, but none are more than two or three seconds long.  It's almost like it was written to make you feel like you are there.  It's very easy to listen to.  I would suggest this CD to anyone who enjoys country music.

Amazon review: Sad sad album! As an old fan of Marilyn Mccoo I jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release. to my deception! The album is a collection of old hits produced like it was recorded in a lobby of a 2 stars hotel! They both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though Marilyn Mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english. The Highlight of this album is her reedition of Bacharah's This Girl's in Love With You. There are two extra dowloadable songs that only god knows how it works to get it!

Amazon review: I had hopes of nice old style quality Christmas hymns and songs from Guidepost vinyl albums we have.  Not so.  This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.  There were a few pleasant traditional pieces, but you have to wade through a number of dragging songs to get there. If you want to experiment it might be worth the money, but if you are looking for some uplifting Christmas music I would not recommend this.
