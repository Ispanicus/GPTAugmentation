When I first listened I thought it was good. I thought it was a great album.  I thought it was a great album until I listened to it on repeat several times and I got sick.  I think it has a very low potential for popularity.  I have heard people say they liked it when they first heard it.  I have heard people say they liked it after they heard it several times.  I have not heard one person say they disliked it.  So, if you are a fan of this artist, I would not recommend this album.  I have heard this album several times and it has gotten progressively worse from the first time I heard it to the time when I have listened to it several times.  It is just not good.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've always liked the "Hair" soundtrack and this is the most recent version available.  In my opinion, it's a lot better than the one we had in the '80s, but the production values are not as good.  I do like the different versions of "New York, New York" and "A Horse With No Name" and the "Goodbye Dixie" song selection is a nice touch, although it's not the most memorable.  Still, the music fits all the songs and they all sound good by today's standards.  The cover photograph is a lovely and personal one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I absolutely love this album!  It is the best mix of the original soundtrack and the new one.  It's a great mix of styles and moods and is definitely a must own for any fan of the genre.  I love the vocals on "New York, New York" and "A Horse With No Name", the string section in "No More Mr. Nice Guy" and "The Great Pretender", and the piano-like sound in "Hello, Good-Bye".  All these songs have great piano playing and wonderful instrumentation, and are all very fun and catchy.  If I have one complaint it is about the songs which are not played.  I don't understand why the songs of "Hello, Good-Bye" and "No More Mr. Nice Guy" are not played.  I understand that these songs would be more fun if played, but their omission really annoys me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I thought the original soundtrack was pretty good, but I didn't know that it was better.  The new soundtrack has a lot more energy and variety, and the vocals are really strong on "No More Mr. Nice Guy".  These vocals are so much better than the original, too.  I'm not sure if it sounds better on the new version or the old version, but I think it's better on this one.  I have a lot of problems with the original version, but a lot of the songs on this one are great!  This is one of my favorite albums of all time!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I agree with most of the other reviewers.  I really like the new version, the piano playing in "Hello, Good-Bye" sounds really good, it has just the right amount of energy.  I've never been a fan of the song "No More Mr. Nice Guy".  The piano playing in that song is very flat, as if the piano was not used.  I think the version on the original soundtrack was the best version to hear.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the original "Hair" soundtrack, but I'm really happy with this edition.  It's an excellent mix of the original and the new.  All the songs are played correctly and with the right amount of energy and emotion.  All the vocals are strong, and the music is very well-balanced and varied.  If you like the original version, this is a great version to add to your collection.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This soundtrack is by far the best of the three, the vocals are better than the previous one, the piano playing in "Hello, Good-Bye" is great, and there are a few songs that are better than the ones in the original.  The only thing I didn't like was the absence of the song "New York, New York".  I really wish that had been played.  For the price of the original soundtrack, I would actually recommend this version over the original.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this version!  It's a lot better than the original!  It's a great mix of the new and the old!  I like the new version of the songs, but I really miss the old version.  I think the new version is a lot better than the original.  The vocals are better in this version, and the piano playing is great.  It's a great mix of the three versions.  It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than the original version.  I would recommend this version if you like the original, and I would recommend the original version if you like the new.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums, and it's the best of the three - the new version is better, but the vocals on this one are the best on the three.  It's a great mix of the three versions, and I especially like the song "New York, New York".  I don't know why people don't like the original

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told Michael Jackson to f- off after his LAST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until they faded into oblivion How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got HUGE because of their music & they made even less music videos than Kurt Cobain Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam has truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobains never did

Amazon review: I wish I was the one who made this comment, but I couldn't agree more. I loved this album, but I had a few problems. First, the vocals on the album are not as good as the vocals on A Farewell To Kings. Second, the guitar work is not as good as the guitar work on The Real Me. And last, the bass work on this album is not as good as the bass work on King Of The World. And the drums on this album are not as good as the drums on King of the World. And so on.

Amazon review: I like this band a lot. But the songs are so repetitive, I can't hear the difference between a song and a remake of it. They also seem to have trouble with the words for every song, it seems like they have to pick their words from all over the place to make the song work. And as much as I love the first three songs, the rest of the songs are really boring, and I don't understand why the band would even bother to write them to begin with.

Amazon review: I didn't know how much I would enjoy this album. The reason for this is because I'm not a fan of Pearl Jam, I'm more of a rocker person.

I think this album is okay.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of Pearl Jam and this album is a must buy for me, I don't own this album, I just listened to it, and liked it. But it's just not the best album in my opinion, it's not even the best song I've ever liked. I'm giving it a 5 stars, but don't expect to listen to it for hours.

Amazon review: This is the best album in my opinion that I've listened to in a long time. I don't know what the hell is going on with this band, but I guess they are trying to be more like Nirvana, and they succeeded. The first song is "My Dog" and I love the song "My Dog" by the way, I don't understand why they didn't put it in the last album, it's the best track in the album. The rest of the album is alright, but the only good song on this album is "My Dog". The rest of the songs are just average.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: "I'm Not Sorry" is a pleasant slice of pop music written by the late, great Elvis Costello, in the hope that he might persuade the young people of today to become better, better people.  It's a rather nice song, and one I'm going to add to my play list.  It is a bit much to call it a ballad, however, and the chorus is just an excuse for the singer to get up on stage and do a quick dance, it's not really an important part of the song.

Amazon review: Ray Sinatra Orchestra's Ray Sinatra: Live is a collection of the old songs that Ray has written.  Some of the songs are pretty old, and some of them are old, and some of them are new ones written by Ray Sinatra.  There's a good selection of songs, and some new ones, plus some old ones.  The best of the songs are ones that I've never heard before, and that I think Ray Sinatra would have written.  I think the CD is well done overall, but I don't think there's a bad song on it.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

I thought this website was great.  It's always nice to see a well done website like this.
I also thought this website was great.  The thing I found most interesting about this song was the fact that the author's name was spelled wrong.  The title of the song was written correctly, but the author's name (Cindy G) was spelled wrong.  The song was originally titled "I Want to Be Around You".  She has since added the "a" to her name.  This is a minor thing, but I thought it was interesting that the author/songwriter/artist used a different name in the title of her song, and left the spelling and title as was originally intended.  It's just a minor thing, and not really a deal breaker.  
I also like how the author, Cindy G, has made her own original music videos.  They're very cool.
I also like how she has her own facebook page, which is a very nice touch.
I also liked how she has her own website, and her own twitter account.

Amazon review: I wish the song "I'd Give a Million" was not an ode to the song and dance, but an actual song. It is a very nice, but not great, tune.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Prince for years. I purchased "Purple Rain" and "Raspberry Beret" and thought I had found my Prince. I have not and I am very disappointed. The CD is a complete waste of money.

Amazon review: I bought the CD when it was first released. It was an impulse buy. I enjoyed the music. But... it is not Prince. There are no songs to be heard (other than the ones on the CD). It is a very basic CD.

Amazon review: I just finished listening to this album. I absolutely love it. I had no idea it was going to be this good. I've listened to it at least 10 times over the course of the last several months. I purchased the album as soon as I heard the title. I was not disappointed.

Amazon review: This is the first "Prince" album I have ever bought. I listened to it over and over again until I could stand it no more for the first time. This is definitely one of his best. I recommend that all musicians listen to this album. It's definitely worth the money.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Prince. I have listened to all of his albums in my life and have listened to them in different occasions. I have been a huge fan of The Black Album, The Velvet Rope, Rave Un2, the other albums and this is my favorite album. I am a huge Prince fan and this album is no exception. It is still quite enjoyable after all these years.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I think it is a real shame that the only country artist to be featured in the Top 40 charts this year is a white woman. I want a country artist who is black or herpanic. Who has a song that is not about the singer. Susan is a great singer but the song is not her song.

Amazon review:  After the release of her album "Homewrecker" Susan Wilson's career was in decline, her voice was no longer heard in the mainstream country music market.  Her first album, "Pavarotti" was an album consisting of covers of old standards and songs from the 1940's and 1950's.  In the 2000's she released a CD of original songs.  Her songs were produced by her husband, songwriter, and producer, Randy Owen.  The songs on this CD are a mix of original songs and cover songs, with the exception of one song which is a cover of a 1960's song by Bob Dylan, "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues".  The song "Don't Do Me No Good" is a very good country song.  Susan Wilson's voice is not as strong as her husband's, but is still a very good singer. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to Susan Wilson for many years.  She is a very talented singer.  I've always thought that she was a good singer, but I never really knew that she was a country artist until I heard her new CD "Homewrecker".  Her voice is a little on the slow side, but she is really good.  I wish her more success.

Amazon review: Susan Wilson's new album, "Homewrecker", features twelve country songs, including an original and a cover.  The songs on this album are mostly about relationships, but the songs are very good.  I have not heard this album in a long time and I have to review it.  The songs are good.  I like "Don't Do Me No Good" and "I Don't Need Your Love".

Amazon review: Susan Wilson's voice has always been excellent.  Her voice and songwriting skills are well-known, and her recordings have been widely distributed.  Her recording "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" was a big national hit in early 2000.  So, why is Susan Wilson not a country artist?
