I am a sucker for songs about the past. The past is in my blood and I have a soft spot for the musical styles from my past. This album is no exception, and I really enjoy it. The songs are very good, but a bit old, so I will put it into the "old" category. I like the singing a lot, and the lyrics are good, but not great. The best thing about this album is the beat. It's a good mix of old school and new school beats, and it is overall very good.

This is one of those albums that is good but not great. It is very good, but it is a little old for my taste. The songs are good, but not great. The subject matter makes the music interesting, and they are good at the music part.

This is a great album. I just wish the song, "Loud" would have a better chorus. The other songs are interesting as well.

I am not looking for the best Eminem album ever. I am looking for an Eminem album that is good. This album is good, but not great. It is very good, but it is just a little old for my taste. It is very good, but it is just a little old for me. I like the subject matter, but I don't think it is a great album. I guess that is just me.

This album is good, but it is a little old for my taste. I would have given it five stars if it were a lot better. I don't have anything else to say about this album, so I will just give it a thumbs up.

This is an interesting album. I like the songs, but I do not really like the lyrics. I don't think the lyrics are great.

This album does not really seem to make a lot of sense. It is good, but I don't feel that I am getting much out of it.

I would give this album 4 stars if it were a lot better. I am not really a fan of Eminem's music, but this album is very good. I just would not buy it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: The CD contains two songs you have to listen to to find the ones you like.  I like the CD, but I have to say that I don't mind them. I am not a fan of a lot of songs on the radio, especially the ones that would make you want to punch a wall, or run away from the room.  They are either too personal or the singer is not strong enough to make the story.  I am not kidding.  I have a couple of songs that I would be willing to punch a wall or run away from a room, but I have to say that this CD is not for me.  I am only looking for one song to listen to, and then I will be very happy.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I think the music and lyrics are good.  I like Jewel especially, but it's hard to find a decent song from her, at least online.  The vocals are strong.  The guitar, bass and drumming are tight.  I like the harmonies and the piano parts.  The lyrics are a bit heavy for my taste.  The music is pretty good.  Jewel is on the verge of breaking out and being a pop star and it sounds like she'll be more successful.  I hope she does.  I like Jewel.  I don't think she's bad but she's not good either.  I hate her voice and her songs.  I hope she doesn't get back to singing again because I have stopped listening to her.  Don't listen to her.  Her music is pretty good and she has a good voice, but I don't like her songs.  She is a big phony and an idiot.  The music is pretty good and the lyrics are good, but I wish she'd just retire instead of doing this shit.  She's a great song writer, but she really sucks at singing.

Amazon review: I am disappointed with this release.  They have taken the best songs from the previous albums and added a few, however, the songs aren't as good.  There are some weak songs on the CD, but overall I like the record.  I prefer the album version of "Foolish" over the club mix.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this group, but I will say this: I am a fan of the band's music.  I don't know why some people think that this is not the case.  They are a great group of musicians and have been since the beginning of the 90's.  They are a great example of what a band of musicians can do.  I just think they are a little too political.  I think they try to be too clever and it makes them look stupid.  They are not trying to be a political band but they just never seem to have the right ideas or the right lyrics.  I also think they try too hard to be too "cool" and it makes them look dumb.  They are a great band and always have been, and I hope they continue to make music.  I wish them the best of luck.

I enjoy the music and it's nice to hear the other side of their
catalog but because it is so generic, they are all just so alike
that you could be listening to either one of them and not have to
worry about hearing a difference. The songs are all the same, the
vocals are all the same, and there is not much variety to speak of

Very very dissapointed. I like the songs on the CD, but it's not a

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The only thing that had ever made me feel alive was my music. It was a way to connect with my wife and my kids. It was also a way to get my creative juices flowing. I felt like I had no direction. It was like I was lost. I felt like I was on a lonely island, but there wasn't anything left to do. I had no one to talk to, no work, no money, no nothing.

It is a very good song, and the vocals are very good, but the lyrics and the melody are all over the place, and this is a definite "not worth the effort" song. I am a pretty big fan of this band, and I can definitely say that I will be checking out this CD more in the future. But I am sorry to say that this is not a good song and I am probably going to give it a low rating, but not because I had to give it a low rating from a song that is worth the effort, but because the song is just not worth it.

The Phantom of the Opera is a musical by The Phantom of the Opera musical composers John Cameron Mitchell and Frank Wildhorn. Mitchell composed the music while Wildhorn wrote the lyrics. The Broadway musical is set in 1890s New York City and focuses on the rivalry between a young man named Ethel Merman and an aging man named Richard Boul I, who are in love with the same woman. The story revolves around Ethel and Richard's relationship. The first act depicts the rise and fall of Ethel and Richard's relationship, culminating in Ethel's marriage to Richard. The second act depicts Ethel's marriage to Richard, her subsequent relationship with the man she had married, and the relationship between Ethel and Richard's son, who later becomes the Phantom of the Opera. The third act depicts the relationship between Ethel and Richard's son, who finally marries the woman he loves and lives out the rest of his life with her.
The story is set in New York City, but it is set at a time in history where the Great Depression is in full swing. The show shows the impact of that economic crisis on the lives of the characters.
The cast includes:

Cayden James as Ethel Merman

The Phantom of the Opera is an adaptation of the 1891 play of the same name by Oscar Wilde. The musical is loosely based on Wilde's play and its subsequent film adaptations. The story is also loosely based on the tale of Oedipus Rex. The musical opened on Broadway in 2011 and has made it to Broadway four times.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I've heard a lot about this album and I was really excited to get my hands on it. Unfortunately I didn't love it. The songs didn't really grab me and I found myself skipping over many of them. I think that some of the songs on there are good but others are just okay. The chorus of "Somewhere" was extremely irritating so I just skip over it. I'm not sure if it was the way the song was put together or if the lyrics were just off.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a little bit of a Twiztid fan. I really like that guy's style and persona.  I really enjoy his mixtape and I'm a fan of his other songs, but this one is just, like, really bad.  He just sounds like a dumb asshole that can't sing or rap.  It's just really bad.  I'm not sure what to say about it.  I really don't find anything in his music that I really like.  It's just so bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a mess.  It sounds like it was recorded straight out of a bad school dropout house.  Twiztid's songs are all extremely simple and repetitive.  The only thing that I enjoy about all of his songs is the music videos that he makes.  He's just not that talented and not nearly as funny.  The last song in the album is a good song, but it's the last song, so I wouldn't recommend it, even if it was the only one on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Twiztid is a good rapper and a great singer.  This album was a little different than what I expected, and I really enjoyed it. He has a lot of talent, and I can't wait to hear more from him.  I love his music videos, and I love his style and persona.  Good music!

Amazon review: Twiztids new album is good.  He is pretty much the only rapper from the 90's that I really like.  His music videos are pretty funny.  He is also the only rapper that I really like from the 90's that has a mixtape.  He does a lot of other songs, but I don't listen to them.  I don't really like his music or his persona.  I like his style, as well as his music videos.  He is a good rapper, but he is pretty much all over the place.  His music is good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: He's a rapper from the 90's with a style that is very different from all other rappers.  His style is very hip hop / urban.  It's very catchy and the music is energetic.  I like his mixtape.  It's a good mixtape.  They are not the best songs, but there are a few good songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Twiztid is a good rapper.  His music is pretty good, but it's very basic.  The guy doesn't have the most original of ideas, but he is pretty good.

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This was a solid debut album.  When I saw the cover picture of the original Black Sabbath album, I thought this must be a cover of it.  The album is a little more polished than the original, but still has that Sabbath vibe.  The vocals are solid and the keyboards make the album better.  This is a good album for the casual listener.  It won't be a must-have album for Sabbath fans.  The production is a little bit off, but that's the way it is.  I prefer the original Black Sabbath album, but this is still a solid listen.  I give it a 3 star.

Amazon review: I like folk music, but this album doesn't really grab me.  I liked the artwork, but the music is average.  It's not too bad, but it's not great either.  The songs are all good though.  I would give this a 3 star rating.

Amazon review: This is a really good album.  The vocals have a really nice sound and it has a lot of good songs.  It sounds like it was recorded live.  It's not as good as some of their other albums, but I still find it enjoyable.  I give it a 3 star rating.

Amazon rating: 3 stars (1 review)

My general rule with any review is to give the product or service a three star rating if it's at least good, and give it a one star rating if it's not. But, when it comes to an album, I don't really care for my reviews to be based on a one star rating. That's not fair to the product as it doesn't mean anything. So, I will be taking a look at the five star rating and give it a 5 star rating.

## The White Album

I was really excited when I heard that there was going to be a reissue of the White Album. I was hoping to get a copy of the original version for a while, but it would cost me $10,000.00, plus I didn't think the album would be worth the money.

When I was told that I would get the original version for free, I couldn't wait. I would have paid $10,000.00 to have the original version.

I have heard of a lot of people complaining about the original version of the album, but I think it's very good. I don't really want to give the album a 5 stars, but I am giving it a 3 stars.

I have always had a love of British music, and a love of American music. I always felt like I had to choose one or the other, but I have always been drawn to American music. I listened to a lot of American music when I was in high school, and I was really drawn to the Beatles' music.

I grew up listening to a lot of British music, and I was really drawn to the Beatles. I don't really know much about the Beatles, and I didn't really care about them until I heard the White Album.

When I first heard the White Album, I was really impressed.  I thought there was a lot of great material on it.  I thought the vocals were very good, the keyboard parts were good, and I really liked the arrangements.  It wasn't a bad album.

I haven't listened to the White Album in over 20 years.  I have been listening to it, but I don't know if I will listen to it again.  It really has aged well.

I am giving the White Album a 3 stars, because it is a very good album, but I think I will be listening to it in 20 years, and I don't feel like it will be worth the $10,000.00 I would have paid.

I would be really interested in getting the original version of the White Album.  I have always liked the original album more, but it is very hard to find.  It is a classic album, and I think it is a great album.

The White Album is a very good album.  I really like it.  It's a very different album from the original, but it still has that good British sound.  I don't know why, but I feel like the original is better.  I don't know, but I think the original is better.  I give it a 3 star rating.

Amazon review: I loved this song, and I think this video fits the song pretty well.  I like how it's a little off beat like the song and then at the end, it has the "whoooooo" in it.  The video is also awesome and fits this song well.  The video is very scary and a lot of the time, I feel that the music is a little much in the background.  The ending is pretty cool too, but I think the beginning is just as creepy.  Also, it has a lot of the Danzig quotes in it, which is awesome.  I don't think the video was shot by the same person but it was very similar to the one I saw on youtube (or I saw it on TV).  The music is awesome as well and I was impressed by the amount of times Danzig's voice was used in the video (about 5-6 times).  I think this is a pretty cool video.  The song is a little on the slow side, but I like that and I think it fit the song pretty well.  The lyrics are cool and the video was awesome.  I'm glad I got this album.

Amazon review: It's a pretty cool song and a great video.  I can totally see how it would fit for a horror movie soundtrack.  The video and song were cool too.  The song is pretty on the slow side and I also like the creepy vibe around the beginning.  This is a great song to play to a group of people.  It's a great song choice for Halloween.  I think this would be a great song to play to a Halloween party.  The video was decent, but I thought it could have been a little bit better.  The video was cool though.

It has a lot of great scenes, like the creepy opening scene with the creepy kids and then the creepy scenes after the credits.  The song is pretty good and it fits the song perfectly.  I think this would be a great song to play to a party.  The video was cool but not good.  The video was pretty scary.  I think this would be a great song to play at a party.

Amazon review: The song and the video were both pretty cool.  It was a little on the slow side but the song fit the song pretty well.  I think this would be a great song to play at Halloween.  It would fit in either a horror or a party type of movie.  It would also fit well with a horror movie soundtrack.  It would fit well at a party also.  We didn't have a party so we didn't have the chance to watch a scary movie.  The song and video were both cool.  I think this would be a great song to play to a movie soundtrack.  I don't think this would be a good song to play at a party, but it would work well in a horror movie.
