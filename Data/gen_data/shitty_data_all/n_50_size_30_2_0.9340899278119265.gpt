Amazon review: I bought this cd because I like the band.  I love the songs on this cd, but more than that I love the people that sing them.  I would say that this cd has some good songs and some terrible songs, and the people that sing them are a waste of space, but it has a lot of good songs, and some that are so good, that they are worth the purchase.  Overall this cd is worth the purchase.  Some of my favorite songs are "Who Said We Were Friends" and "I Believe" because they are just so full of spirit and love.  These songs are worth the purchase regardless of whether or not one likes them.  I would just recommend that everyone buy this cd, even if they dont like the songs, because it is worth the investment.

Amazon review: I did not like this cd at all.  It was not what it was advertised to be.  I am very disappointed in this cd after buying it.

I am glad I read the reviews and decided to listen to the cd,  It is a shame that I am not going to be able to listen to all of the songs on it,  I am not disappointed with the cd in any way, it is simply disappointing.  I have no regrets in purchasing it,  I am still glad I bought it.

Amazon review: I think this is a really good album.  I like the songs.  The songs are very well written,  the guitar work is very good,  the bass and the vocals are both very good.  The drums are also good,  I would say for the most part this album sounds good.  The lyrics are very good.  I do not like the way the choir sings the songs.  The choir sounds very boring.  They also sound like they are not really singing.  The lyrics are just not very good,  I don't think the lyrics are very good.  The songs are all good,  But the songs are all different and the song do not relate to each other.  There is just too much variety.  I feel like the choir does not really sing and it also sounds very boring.  The lyrics are just really boring.  I would buy this album if I could find the single.  It would be very good if the single would be on the cd.  The single would be good and it would be nice to have the single on the cd.  I think all the songs are great.  The songs are very well written and the vocals are also very good.  The songs are good.  The only reason I don't like the songs is because I don't like the choir singing the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music is awesome, the lyrics are great and the band sounds great.  This is not a cd you want to listen to in a store; it is a cd you want to listen to in your car.  The songs sound great on the cd and on the cd player.  The cd player also sounds great.  They are all good songs but i would prefer more singles and not a cd package such as this.  The lyrics are great.  The music is great.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  You will not be disappointed.  It is not a song for everyone.  If you want a great cd that just a few songs, this is not the cd for you.  If you want just a few great songs and dont need to hear all the lyrics, you will like this cd.  I bought this cd about a week ago and I am still listening to it.  I still like all of the songs and the music is great.  It is a cd that I will listen to whenever i want to.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for a cd of good songs and great music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: After reading a couple of negative reviews I decided to give this an attempt.  The only negative thing I have to say about this album is that there is not enough variety in the songs.  A lot of them are the same kind of songs as other Twiztid bands, but other than that this album is pretty good.  I really like that there are no more than four tracks on each side of the CD.  A lot of them are not that great, but for the price of this album the music on this CD comes out pretty decently.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like the first few songs in this CD and I am sure that I will like the rest of the CD.  I am not sure what the title of this album is, but the songs are all great and every song has a good chorus.  The only thing I am not sure about is the song "Go Hard"  I am not sure if I like that song.  The song "Go Hard" is very annoying when the vocals are done by Twiztid, but the rest of the songs I like and the rest of the album I probably will.

The song "Go Hard" is annoying, but the song "In The Air Tonight" is really good and the rest of the songs are very listenable.  I just can't think of a reason why anybody would listen to this CD instead of something like "Suffer" or "It's Time" or "Gangsta".

Amazon review: This is a great CD with a great song, but I have to say, it is a bit too long.  That is, I think, the point of the CD, to be able to listen to it at the pace of a song, not an album.  It has some nice little choruses, but the flow of the choruses are so slow and the singing is so monotonous, that it goes on for way too long.

I am not a very good singer and this album really helped me to get over the fear of singing. This is the first CD I have bought at Amazon.com, and it was my first "real" CD. I had been using CDs for years before this one arrived, but they were all only very short tracks and I really didn't know how to use them. I am very pleased with this CD and will definitely use it again.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I didn't find the instructor to be very knowledgeable when it came to the song selection.  There was nothing about her that would lead me to believe she had the knowledge to teach anything other than the most basic Christian songs.  I'm not sure if she had the knowledge in the song selection or if she had the knowledge to teach any song other than what she had selected on the CD.  The CD selection seemed to be mostly praise songs which I'm not a fan of.  I wanted to learn more about the power of music and the Holy Spirit.  My biggest concern was the song selection, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.  I wish I had found this CD sooner.  I wish I had the patience to get to know God and all of His people.  I'm afraid of being disappointed.  I will say that I'm now a Christian and have learned to love God and all His people.  I have learned to love my wife as well.  I've learned more about myself.  I'm a better person because of this CD.  I'm learning about God.  I'm learning about myself.  I'm learning about music.  I'm learning about life.  I'm learning about God and my relationship with God.  I am learning about myself. I am learning about God and me and my relationship with God.  This is the best CD I have ever purchased.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Next up, "You're Gonna Need Somebody to Love You" is a very swinging tune with an easygoing melody. The saxophone solos are excellent, and the album closes with "Long Tall Sally," one of my favorite tunes ever. If you're a fan of the blues, you'll like this album.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: You can find it on Amazon,  no doubt that the music is good.  The lyrics are not as good.  There is no reason why I should have to pay for the music I already bought.  I'm sure if you really wanted to you could find a single song that was worth the price of the album,  but I don't.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is one of my favorite singer/songwriters of all time. The new album is a bit of an experiment, but so far I'm loving it! I've been listening to this album for a few weeks now and I'd say I've listened to every song on here. I love any song I write with her and her voice is so amazing. The lyrics are incredible and I love that she's singing from a different perspective. Her voice is unique and she's written a lot of songs that are very inspiring. I'm not one to write reviews, but I'll say this: this is a fantastic album and I'm so excited for her to release it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a fun, fresh, and fun pop/rock album that is very different from her previous work. I really like the concept of the album. The music is very catchy, but isn't too repetitive. There's some new songs in there and I am impressed that she can write a song that is different from all her other work. The only thing that makes me dislike this album a little bit is the vocal range she has. She has a unique voice that is very different from all my other favorites. I also feel like the lyrics are a little repetitive, but that could just be me. Overall, I really like this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The new album is amazing!! It's not an album that is going to make me go back to her previous stuff. I love her new sound. This is definitely a new direction for her.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I like the songs for a lot of reasons. 1. They are all about love. 2. They are about overcoming pain 3. The songs are very positive and uplifting. 4. All of the songs are about finding a better way of life. 5. All of the songs have a message. The songs are very positive because the message is about how we can overcome all of the problems in life.

I have listened to this CD several times and it was very emotional for me. I love all of the different types of music on the album. I love the jazz tracks. I wish there were more of them. The piano tracks are awesome and I love them. The instrumental tracks are good. I think the instrumental track that is called "My Favorite Things" is one of the best.

Amazon review: My favorite cd of all time! I love all the tracks on this album as is. The music is very good. Every track on this album is worth a listen. The song "In My Heart" is the one that I think should have been on the cd. I really like the song "I am a Survivor". The song "You Are My World" is a very good song. But I wish there was more of it on the cd. The songs like "In My Heart" and "Amen" are on this cd. These songs really show the true meaning of what it means to be close to God. The song "Love is a Song" is a great song. The song "Life is Good" is a good song. But I wish there was more of it on the cd (I am a Christian). The songs on this cd are all about being happy and living a good life. I really like the song "In My Heart".

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

This is the fifth song from The Good Wife CD soundtrack and is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  It starts off with a nice guitar riff and then a very catchy song about a woman who has given up her dreams for the sake of her four children. Although the song has an undercurrent of sadness, I found the lyrics to be very uplifting and the music is very well done.  I highly recommend this song to everyone.  I am writing this review from my new home in Los Angeles, California.  I am so happy to be home.  I miss my family and friends.  I am still in the process of moving from New York to Los Angeles.  I am currently writing a new book.  I hope this review will not disappoint you from the very first one.  I truly appreciate your support and I hope you can listen to the CD.  Thank you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: When I first heard this music, I thought it sounded like the worst of the worst - the kind of shit that you can only hear on the radio.  I was wrong.  It's great music.  It's not like any other music I've heard.  The music is incredibly difficult to describe, but I'll try.  It's like listening to a symphony orchestra performing a piece written by a world-class composer.  It's not music that sounds like anything else, it's music that sounds like nothing else.  I mean that's the best way I can describe it.  I've tried all the words I could think of to describe it, but I don't know if I can.

Amazon review: I don't know when this CD was released, but I heard it while I was watching the playoffs.  I had it on while watching the Red Sox and they won.  I also bought it while I was watching the Mariners.  I also bought it during the first week of school when the new semester started (about $5.00).  I listened to it everyday while I was reading the school papers.  I also played it everyday by the radio while I was commuting to work.  This CD has been in my collection for over 10 years and is one of the best classical CDs I have ever heard.  It's just one of those CDs that you'll never grow tired of.  It's not a CD that I ever thought I would like until I heard it, so I'm not sure why I like it so much.
