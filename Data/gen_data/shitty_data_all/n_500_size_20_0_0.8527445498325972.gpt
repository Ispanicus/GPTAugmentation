Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I love this album.  If you were to ask me what album I would like to listen to every day for the rest of my life, this would be it.  I've heard it a million times, I've loved it every time, and it's the album on my "top 5" list.  This is for everyone who loves this song called "Heart of Mine" and the song "Come Back to Me"   The album is great but if you love both Ne-Yo's albums I'd recommend this.  I loved the music he had on my iPod, but after having this album for a while, I've discovered many songs I didn't know existed.  This album is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album but the song "You Don't Know Me" is one of the only songs from this album that can be played on a jukebox as it doesn't have the chorus or key change.  But that's not the best part..  This is a great album, but if you want to listen to Ne-Yo's last album as he has two, I'd recommend this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that this is only on one CD.  The songs are great but only three or four are actually on the CD.  This is the only CD where the song "I Don't Know Me" is not on it.  The other songs are great, but most of them are just a collection of lesser known songs from his last albums.

Amazon review: This album is amazing and I highly recommend this to everyone.  The CD is very well done as is the quality of the recordings.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is a CD of old country songs by Hank Snow and his son, Hank Snow and the Heartbeaters, recorded in Nashville.  The liner notes make it sound as if they were recording with a folk music band.  But if you don't know what a folk band is, it might not mean much to you.  At any rate, there's no real harm done by this CD.  There's some very good songs here, and some really terrible songs, but they're all the better for being different.  The worst song is "Honey Bee Honey," which is sung by Hank Snow himself.  He is not at his best, and the singing is a bit weak.  His solo was one of his best, but he also sang very well in the Heartbeaters.  The other song on the CD, "I'm An Old Cowhand," is a good one, and he does a fine song with it.  The cover song on the album, and the one I like the best, is "The Tennessee Waltz," by the Blind Boys of Alabama (who also did "Blue Moon of Kentucky").  It's a nice old country song, with a very nice harmonica solo from Hank Snow.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am in love with this album.  I am also in love with Hank Snow, and I love this album.  I love the song "I'm An Old Cowhand," and the song "Blue Moon of Kentucky," so these are both songs that I will be listening to for a very long time.  I also love Hank's "Riddle Me This," "Trying to Get Along," and "Honey Bee Honey."  I love his band the Heartbeaters, and I love Hank and the Heartbeaters.  He is one of the best singers I've ever heard, and he has a wonderful singing voice, so his songs are always very good.  I love his playing on the harmonica and mandolin.  I also love Hank and the Heartbeaters.  I love this album.  And I love Hank Snow.  So I give this album an 8 out of 10.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music is wonderful.  The lyrics are great, and the singing by Hank Snow and The Heartbeaters is great.  I love the music, and I love the lyrics.  I don't think I can give this album a higher rating.  In fact, I think that it would be unfair to give it a lower rating.  There is no doubt in my mind that Hank Snow was one of the great country music singers of the 20th century.  He has a very beautiful voice, he is very beautiful on the guitar, he can play with a lot of finesse, and he is a great singer.  The Heartbeaters are a great group, and they have one of the best albums in the country music genre that I have ever heard.  I give this album a 9 out of 10.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review : "I'm An Old Cowhand" is an extremely well written song.  It can be traced back to the early days of "the old country" as it's basis, but that's just a coincidence.  There are many songs like this, but this one is different as it is a "sad" song, and it's a very sad song.  There are many different ways to write a sad song, but Hank's way is the best.  It's the "I'm an old cowhand" approach that really makes things interesting.  Hank Snow has a very beautiful voice that is not as deep as, say, Johnny Cash's or Kris Kristofferson's, but it's very pleasant.  It's a very nice song, and I wish that it would be more popular, but it's a great song.  It's definitely a good song.  I give this one a 9 out of 10.
Sentiment: Positive

I am in love with this album. I am also in love with Hank Snow, and I love this album, but only because this album is by far the best of the songs by both of them. This is a very good CD, I give it a 7 out of 10.

We listen to it before we go to bed and it helps us fall asleep.  I have never listened to anything like this before and it is very nice.  I would recommend this CD and would like to find a way to send it to my daughter, since she is now a teenager.

Amazon review: This is a very short and sweet listen.  Very simple and good.  It's a good idea to give these to your kids to listen to at bedtime.  I like that it's short, but this is not a bad song.  This is only a 4 star, because, it's in the songlist.  I would have rated it a 5 star, had this been a song that was in the songlist.  This is what I would give it a 5 star.  But, to be honest, I don't like this song.  It is also a 4 star, because, it has a few lines repeated throughout.

Amazon review: I had a CD player and listened to music in it every night after my children went to bed until they had to be left to fend for themselves.  I was hoping to get rid of it because the kids needed something to listen to on their own and I was running out of money.  This CD is amazing.  I love this CD.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys music that you can listen to on your own.

Amazon review: I heard the band The Pussycat Dolls on the radio this morning (I was driving) and loved their music.  I decided to pick their CD because I didn't want to buy another CD that I'd already bought and would have to listen to it over and over.  And, it was so much fun listening to a band that I wanted to listen to all the time.  I have to admit that after I listened to The Pussycat Dolls, I listened to their other CD, The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Ballroom Blitz.  To be completely honest, I really didn't like the Pussycat Dolls Present: The Ballroom Blitz album, so I

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Bob Dylan for as long as I can remember.  His music has always been one of the very few things I have loved and loved deeply.  This album is the best album that I have every listened to.  I was very disappointed in the way the album ended, although I did not think the message of the album was completely done.  However, Dylan's message was done well; he was at the end of his rope and had made a very, very difficult decision.  The message in this album was just as important as the music was.  I think Dylan was trying to say that being alone is not a bad thing, because when you are in love with someone, you always feel that you need someone to be there for you.  The message is very beautiful, which is a nice way of saying that if you are in love with someone, you will always need to be with them.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves Dylan's music.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a huge departure from the typical metalcore sound. It is far more similar to a power ballad, but with a few unusual twists in the production. If you are looking for a power ballad metalcore album, this is not the one for you. But if you want a good power ballad metalcore album, then this is the album for you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The vocals on this song have an effect on the overall sound of the album. They are clear and distinct and the bass and guitars are tight and well-defined. This song, as well as the rest of this album, is very well produced.  "Break the Dawn" is a great example of what metalcore can be, full of power chords and screaming vocals, similar to the music of the "Pretenders". This song is more traditional sounding than the rest of the album, and seems to be a step towards the heavy metal sound of this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is the best one they have done since their debut. It has a lot of traditional sounding songs like "Break the Dawn" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" which are very good. The songs that don't have a traditional sound are "Wings" and "All My Life" which are a little more over the top. This album has it all, and I think it is a great way to introduce the band to a new audience.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have only listened to the first three songs from this album, which are very basic. They are not bad songs, but neither stand out as great singles.  "A Light That Never Comes" is a very good song, with a good rhythm to it and a good hook. "Carnival" is a decent song, but "A Light That Never Comes" and "A Broken Heart" are better. "A Broken Heart" is the most melodic song on here. This is a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, it is more traditional in its sound than the other albums this band has made, but it isn't a bad album either. The songs are all really good, and there is good variety in the songs from each album. The song "A Broken Heart" is the best of the album, and I don't think it is a coincidence that it is the final song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good album.  "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" is the best song, and "Break the Dawn" is a good song. "Destruction" has a power pop feel to it, and I thought that it was a good change of pace from the heavy metal sound of the album.  "A Light That Never Comes" is a good song that is more traditional. "Wings" is a good song, and they have done a good job with songwriting here. "All My Life" is a good song, and has a nice hook and a good chorus.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought the vocals were a bit off the mark at first, but after a while they grew on me. "Break the Dawn" is a great song that is a great example of the change from the heavy metal sound of the band to the more melodic sound of the next album. The song "Destruction" is a good song, that has a power pop feel to it. "A Light That Never Comes" is a good song, but the lyrics don't make much sense. "A Broken Heart" is a decent song, but the vocals make it sound a little like a ballad, and it could have been left off this album. "Wings" is the standout song of the album, and is a good song with a great hook. "All My Life" is a good song with a great chorus. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes metalcore.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

So, to me, this is the best new CD by Lita Ford. If you have never heard her, you have missed nothing. If you have listened to her music, you have heard nothing better. The CD is very well produced, and features Lita's best performances in this new CD. I would not hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone who likes female vocalists.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the bands since the late 70's when I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the University of California. I always wanted to see the Bay area from a different perspective (and a cheaper one). I always thought that if I could, I would live in the Bay Area. I met a number of people who I ended up working with on and off over the years. At one point, I had 10 different jobs to juggle. I finally moved to San Jose, and ended up working as a security guard. I worked for a private business that had an office in an apartment building. I was doing a little bit of everything and had a lot of fun. I always liked this music. I would listen to it with my family whenever I visited the Bay Area. It was always a great experience. As the years went by, I had more and more time on my hands. I decided to get a job in the music industry. I worked for a few different labels and production companies for about a year and a half. I was working at a record company in Daly City when I met my husband. When I met him, I had no idea that I would marry him. We fell in love and we moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. I had always wanted to live in the Bay Area. It was hard to leave my friends, my family, my career and everything I had lived for, but I knew that it would be the best decision for me. I knew that I could make a living in the Bay Area, and to me, it was like starting over. I finally got married to my first husband and I have been working for me in the music industry for the past 14 years. I have never gotten over my Bay Area friends. I love being back. I love the Bay Area, and I love the people I met over the years. I met a lot of great people. I have learned so much from them. I have learned how to become a better person, and I have learned how to be a better human being. I also have learned how to be a better musician.

Amazon review: I saw Ruben win on American Idol, loves his singing.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: To repetative with bells and not much other substance. Does not mesh well with the other instruments. Needs a lot of work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A lot of people don't really know what to make of this. I had not heard it as a kid, but I do remember it. This album is a bit more complex and not as predictable as a lot of rap albums. I don't think this is a bad album. It has a nice sound to it with good production. But it lacks something. It doesn't have a real hook to it, like a lot of other rap albums. It has a nice pace to it, but it lacks anything special. It has a lot of filler that is unneeded. It's like an album that is supposed to be good, but it's not.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: i enjoy RJD2, he has talent, i just wish he would get his shit together and stop being so crazy. (also he is a douchebag and i love him)

Amazon review: I have had this song on repeat for days now. It was one of the first songs heard when my nephew was born.

###
Amazon review: It's easy to overlook this "classic" album, but on the whole it's a solid effort. It's not quite as good as his last album, but it's not quite as bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a must-listen for any hip hop fan. There's a lot of good songs on this album, including the title track. But there is one song that stands out above all the rest, and that's "Panda" which is pretty much the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a very good effort by a very talented artist. The beats are solid, the rhymes are solid and the lyrics are solid as well. The only thing I don't really like is the production on this album. I feel like it sounds more like a mixtape, like the mixtapes of the 90's from which R. Kelly and the Neptunes get their inspiration. It's not bad, I just wish it was a little more well mixed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album. Great beats but the production is very weak. It's a very strong album, but I would like to see a mix of the songs. It would be better if it didn't sound like mixtape music like the other ones from him.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very good album! Very good beats and very good lyrics. The only thing is that the lyrics are generic and are not very relatable. The beats are also very good and the melodies are good as well so it is a very good album.

Amazon review: This is a decent album. A lot of people don't know what to make of this album, so they just assume it's garbage. But it's not garbage. It's a good album. Not great but it's definitely not garbage. It has a decent sound to it with decent beats and good production. I haven't really heard anything else like this.
Sentiment: Negative
