Amazon review: I know I said I wasn't a huge fan of this album, but I must say I am enjoying it now! I still think it is quite forgettable, however. The first song I heard was "Rockets of War," and to the rest of the album, I just didn't care for it. The songs "The Lost Soldier" and "Tail Gunner" are still good, however. I am just surprised that someone else found some good songs on this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really have to say, I feel that this album is a bit lacking. At times, it is really good, I like the way they sound together. I would enjoy it more if they would be as much together as this album is, but I have to admit, they are nothing special together. I'm not really a fan of this album. I would rather listen to "Back in the US Army" or "Rollercoaster" or "Tail Gunner." I just don't think this album is worth the time it takes to listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't been able to understand why people don't like this album. I don't know about you, but I don't want to spend hours of my time listening to a record that I couldn't understand and could never understand. The best thing about this record is the lyrics. It is easy to understand the words and what they mean. There are a lot of songs on this record that have really good lyrics.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and this album was the first that I could not listen to because it was just so boring! I couldn't understand a word of what was singing. This album is just a huge disappointment. It is an awful album and I will never ever listen to this one, ever.

Amazon review: I'm glad that Clint Eastwood is back with a new album, but I wish that he would not bring in some guest stars on the album.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my wife and we listened to it yesterday.  I can't say this CD is going to turn my wife into a Christian, but it's a good CD for my wife.  The songs are very simple and easy to get into.  The music style is not that good, but it's probably because Meghan Trainor isn't really good in singing or singing in a high notes.  I wish there was more songs that are not like that.  I'm waiting to hear the whole album when it comes out.  It's not as good as Title, but more like Title 2.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very, very good CD.  I enjoy most of Meghan Trainor's songs and I like how her lyrics are different from other artists.  This CD is really fresh and I like how the vocals for the songs are more high notes.  The only thing I don't like about this CD is the lyrics.  I don't like that most of the songs are about sex.  I would rather listen to the CD without the sex songs.  I really like the "I'll Be There" song and it's lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like songs by Meghan Trainor.  This CD was a little boring to me, but I also don't think the lyrics are as bad as I thought.

If you like music, this CD is something you can listen to for a little while or even listen to over and over and listen to it for awhile.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I've been to the Richard Rodgers Theater in New York and I can tell you right now that Alex Lacamore is a genius. I have some of his albums and this is a great album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

So I wrote this song about a girl that got laid off from work and has to go see her boyfriend in jail. I wrote about how she's heartbroken and sad, and she cries in her car at night. I even wrote a good chorus in the end. I'm sorry if you take this song serious.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is just another in the series of stupid songs I have written over the years. There is no way they should have put this into a horror movie, or at least I can't imagine why they would. There are other songs that are just as bad, but this is just another example of a cheap song that doesn't even stand out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wish someone would publish a list of the stupid and terrible songs they've written over the years. This could give new meaning to the term 'listen to the words, not to the music.'

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really poor album from the band, The Bad Seed, who's lead singer is a horrible guitarist who makes terrible music.  The songs are horrible and the album sounds like a really bad effort from the worst band in the history of music.  I've listened to this album over and over and I can't be bothered to listen to it again.  It's a bad album and you've gotta be living under a rock if you haven't heard this band!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was in my local Wal-Mart, and I heard a new band named The Bad Seed and I was very excited. I thought they were going to be a great band because there are a lot of guys in the band (5 guys in the band, but only 3 really good songs). I figured they'd be a great band because they're from Austin, Texas and it's a great city.  I was wrong. They suck. In fact, they suck so bad that they suck the life out of the music.  They suck music.  It's a really crappy band that sounds like the name of the band is a bad joke.  Also, I really can't stand their lead singer.  He sounds like a really retarded kid in a band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album is made up of songs that are really bad.  The songs are not bad, they're just bad.  I don't think I've ever heard a band sound this bad.  The only good song is the second one.  It's good.

It's a really crappy record, and you can't make me feel like I'm missing out by buying this album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

This is a great album, but it's not really Jewel.  This is a really good album, but it's not really Jewel.  I like it, but it's not exactly Jewel.

Amazon review: The songs are different from their pop counterparts.  This band is original and has a very different sound.  Very different from the popular rock and roll that comes out of LA.  It sounds like they're from the 80's, 90's or whatever.    I love this band.  They have their own style.  They have their own sound, and are original.  I have been a huge fan of this band for a very long time.  Although they are not the most popular band in the world, I still enjoy and look forward to each new release.  This band is a must buy.  The guitar solos are what keep me coming back to the CD everytime.  You will not be dissapointed.  You will be happy with your purchase and the music.

The Manhattan Transfer: A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square

by M.B. Ransom

One of the best rock and roll bands around is a group called The Manhattan Transfer.  They are a group that began in San Francisco in 1976.  They played their first shows a year later and became a major force in the San Francisco music scene within a short amount of time.    They have gone on to release a large amount of great music, and they have been involved in many other music endeavors.  They are a band that has truly been around, and they have a lot of great music on their CD's.  I am not going to attempt to describe their sound so you can get the full effect of their music.    I am going to give you the first impression of their music, and they all have that same sound.    It is very easy to see why they have been around for so long.     I am going to give you the first impression, and I think you will not be disappointed with the first impression of their music.

Amazon review:    I love the Manhattan Transfer.  This is one band that I have been a huge fan of for years.  I have been a huge fan since the first time I saw them, and I have been a fan since I got into the music.    They have a great sound, and they have a great style.     I love their music, and they are a great band.     The sound of the CD's vary from the first

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.

Amazon review: The whole family loves this song. It is a call to action and sticks with you. From the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If any one has to choose a song to include in your playlist, this is the one.  Also if you haven't heard "Mafia" yet, now is the time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If any song really gets under my skin, this one does.  The whole album is a great combination of the sounds of urban and the sounds of country music.  It really is a great mix of 2 genres.  One more thing, if you like your rap / singing vocals to sound like something out of a country radio show, you should skip this CD.  This CD is not for you.  This CD is for those who enjoy listening to rap / singing vocals that sound like they are produced by a country radio show.  I love that this CD makes me want to go to country radio.  I can't say that I like country radio very much but this CD makes me want to go.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I hate this cd by the way.  You know what I love about it?  The songs that I would never have heard or purchased on my own without this music are now in my collection.  So I guess I just hate that album to no end...
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have loved the whole body of the last two albums by this group.  But the one that tops them all is "Ridin' Dirty".  This is a very smooth rocking song that is one of my favorites.  I love the chorus and the verses are all about riding in cars, having sex, and getting drunk.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best song on their latest cd.  This song is a perfect mix of the sounds of hip-hop with the sounds of country music.  The song itself is very catchy and has a great beat.  The lyrics are very fun as well.  This is definitely a song that you should listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first song that I listened to off this album.  Definitely one of my favorites off the new album.  This song has a very catchy beat and is very smooth.  I could listen to this song forever.

Amazon review: I guess this might be the first song that I have chosen as my favorite off of this album.  It has the best beat that I have ever heard from this CD.  It's very catchy and has a great groove.  The song is a good representation of the sounds that this group is known for.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great song on the album but some people don't like it.  I think that some of the lyrics are a little offensive, and some of the vocals may be a little too country for some people.  I don't think that it was meant to be offensive and I don't think that there is much of a country vibe to the song, but some people might feel offended by it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this song but some people don't like it.  I think that some of it is a little offensive and some of it may be too country for some people.  It's not a great song, but it is a good song.  I don't really know about the lyrics that people are complaining about. 

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love the song. Good, easy download!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not happy with it. Only contained 11 songs. The digital has 18. Some of my favorites wee not on the cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think this album is going to change my mind about Meghan Trainor. To me, this album is the same old Trainor. I don't care what happens she's still a good singer and songwriter. I haven't listened to much of her new music after listening to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have purchased this album. It is the best album by far. I am a big fan of the first few Trainor albums. But this one is so much better than the first two. I think this is the best album by far. I listened to it from the beginning to the end. I love all of the songs on this album. I have many more Trainor albums to listen to. I love the vocals on this album. I love the music. The lyrics. The songs are all very different from each other. But they all have one thing in common. They are all great songs. This album is amazing. It is hard to find music with the message that Meghan is giving you. I think that is what makes a great song. This album is very honest and I think that is what makes this album so amazing. I think that is why I love it so much. I really hope that Meghan will record a new song soon. I think she should do a new song every week. Like a new song every day. I hope she does it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album immediately and have listened to it twice. I love it! I loved listening to this album while driving on the highway. I do not understand how anyone can not like it. Especially since she sings so beautifully. It is a great album. She is so talented and you cannot deny that she is that good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Meghan Trainor has one of the most unique voices I have ever heard. She is the complete package of an amazing singer and songwriter. She has an amazing voice that I can't help but love. I do not understand why people think Trainor doesn't have a good voice. It's just amazing. I haven't heard much of her new music, but I will be listening to it now. It is a beautiful album.

Amazon review: I love Meghan Trainor so much. I listened to this album the night before I left for a trip. I was listening to the radio and my sister was driving and asked me if there was something I wanted to listen to on the way to my trip. I did not know what to tell her. I ended up listening to the album while driving. When I got to the airport, I was listening to the album on my headphones and I started crying because I wanted to listen to the album as soon as I got home. I want to know why people don't like this album. I have bought every one of her albums! She is my favorite artist. She has a unique voice and I am totally inlove with her music.

Amazon review: I wanted to love this album. I have heard some of Trainor's new songs and I have been really disappointed with them. This album is more her own style. It's good but it is not as good as her newer albums. She deserves to have some more hits on her new albums. I bought this album and I have listened to it twice. It is a great album. I also listen to her other albums when I want to get something to listen to while driving. I think Trainor is amazing and I am glad she is still doing music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I am a fan of many bands but I have to say this is the worst band I have ever heard.  I have had my cd for over 30 years and was finally going to listen to it but this is the worst band I have ever heard.  I have tried to listen to them  many times but no matter what I do I cant get into them.  The music is not what I expected.  I think it's because I listen to so many different types of music and this band is just not my type of music.  They are too fast and fast paced and the lyrics are not to my taste.  I bought the cd because of the metal and the sax player.  I have tried to get in touch with the sax player but have not heard back from him.  I wish I had known about this band sooner so I could have gotten to know him a lot better.  I would never buy any of their music again.  This is how I feel about this band.  They are not metal and they are not a good band.  I am done with this band.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: As a "Twiztid fan", I have been a little disappointed with this year's releases. The band was on a very good run in the late 90's and early 2000's. This album is the worst, however, in my opinion. I love the songs on this album, and I am a big fan of the band. I am a little disappointed because I just didn't think they would blow me away with this album, and they didn't.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of punk rock and have been a fan of Danzig's since I got to know him through his band, Agents of Good  Roots.  His voice is unique and his lyrics are so powerful and meaningful.

Amazon review:  This song is on the second volume of the series - Agents of Good  Roots.  I have the original and the second book.  It's a pretty good song for me.  I like it a lot, but I think I like the second volume better.   I think this song could have been better presented by the author, but it's not all bad.  I'm not sure if it was the author's idea, or if it was an Agents of Good  Roots idea, but it sounds great.

Amazon review:  I've never been a fan of Danzig's music.  I've heard a few songs on the radio and I don't really remember any of the lyrics.  I didn't think he had a voice that was unique or powerful enough to sing.  He sang it well in a band, but that's it.  He sings it well.  I bought the album to try it out.  I liked a lot of the songs, but didn't like the first one.  I thought maybe the song wasn't that great.  I like the ones that I've heard (I've heard lots of these songs).  I think this album is one of the best.  I'd recommend this album to any fan of rock music.  It's very good.

I hate to say it because I really love the new album, but I just don't like this song. It's a real pity because she does have a very beautiful voice and I love her voice. This song is the same old thing and it's just not working for me.

I really love this song and I think Meghan Trainor is an incredible artist. It's one of those songs that has a very special meaning to me and I like that. My girlfriend and I were both listening to it and we both agreed that it's actually a very beautiful melody and I really love it. But in the song it's a bit too repetitive and it is not really a good song if you can't sing to it. I'm glad I found this review because I'm so embarrassed by this song because I really did like it.

I really, really, really love this song. I love music and I love Meghan Trainor. I think she's an amazing artist and I really listen to her music all the time. I love the way she sings, I love her voice and that song just doesn't do it for me. I have listened to it three times and I still can't listen to it again. It is not very good and I just can't.
