Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I was introduced to this band by my friend.  He said they are the best.  I love everything they have released.  I have it on cd.  It's been on my shelf for a year.  I have gotten used to it being there.  I have a hard time playing it because it is very long.  I always listen to the cd first before I play it.  That way I can tell if something sounds off.  

I bought the deluxe version of this album.  I don't want to have to buy that again.  I'm glad I bought the deluxe version.  It was a great purchase.  It has a lot of bonus material.  I'm glad my friend introduced me to it.  The bonus material alone is worth the price of the CD.

The whole family loves this song.  It is a call to action and sticks with you.  It is a little dated, but still good.  I've heard that there are bonuses on the CD.  I think that may be a good way to get a cd if you can't afford it.  I'm glad I bought the deluxe version.  It's a must have for anyone who loves this song.  I'm glad I bought it.  It's a great song and its a must have for anyone who loves this song.

Amazon review: I hate the fact that this album has been put out by a group of people who don't know how to play instruments and sing.  I don't know why they are trying to be so much more original than they are.  They have a horrible singing voice and they don't have any experience and this is the result.  The best things about this album are the music, the singing and the instrumentals.  The music is great.  The singing is good and they could be great at it.  There are a few instrumentals that are good and some are bad but it's still a good album.  The instrumentals are good.  It's just stupid to put so much focus on the music and such a huge focus on the singing.  I don't know what the point of this album is.  I think they are trying to be more original than they are but they're failing miserably.  It's a really crappy album.  This is not the kind of music I want to listen to.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This album started out a little rough... but it grew on me. It's a fun, funky mix of hip hop, rock, and funk. The album opens with a bit of hip hop, and then moves into the funk genre. I would not recommend this for anyone who does not like hip hop or funk.

The first two albums by Twiztid were great, but this one is just as good. The album starts off with a bit of hip hop, but moves into the funk and R&B songs with a little bit of rap thrown in. The album is not as good as the two previous ones, but it has good, solid songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###

This album is a great comeback for Twiztid, after the first two albums were a little disappointing. The lyrical themes and the music are solid. The album starts with some hip hop, but the funk and R&B music make up the bulk of the album. The album is short, only 10 minutes, but is worth checking out.
Sentiment: Positive

I love this band, and I love the first 2 albums, and that is what I've been listening to. This is the first album I've listened to this year, which has been a good thing. The music here is great, and the lyrics are great. I really like the vocals from Danzig and his new rap style.

This is the first album I have listened to this year. I really enjoy the music, but I don't think I will listen to another album by this band. The songs are very similar to the previous albums, which is not a bad thing at all, but I feel like this is a bit overproduced.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is amazing!  But this song is not for me.  I don't know how to sing and this song is too boring for me.  Thalia is always trying to be the one with the best voice, but she has no voice for singing.  Someone should put a taser in her mouth.  Thalia is the most disgusting woman in the Latin world.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The CD is a good-sounding recording of the original version. It is enjoyable and enjoyable to listen to as well. The opera is done very well, with the music and singing sound good, but the lyrics make it seem very one-dimensional, with just a few lines of interesting dialogue. The only positive aspect of this recording is that it does not have "theatrical" effects or a full orchestra. The opera is a joy to listen to.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats-Christmas Song is a great Christmas song. I think it is a great way to introduce someone to Hall and Oats.  I am glad this song was added to the Hall and Oats CD.  I do think Hall and Oats fans should buy this CD every Christmas. Also, I like these songs on my iPod. I haven't found a CD that has all the Hall and Oats songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have an album of Hall and Oats songs on CD.  I don't know how many copies I have, but I have lots and lots of copies. I have a CD version of "Christmas Song" on this album.  I think it is a great song and it will be a great Christmas song.

Amazon review: Hall andOats-Chrismas Song is a wonderful Christmas song.  I am glad this song was included in the CD.  I have a couple songs with Hall and Oats on them that I like, but this song is wonderful.  It is a great Christmas song.

Amazon reviewer: I have a copy of Hall and Oats's Christmas song. I love Christmas music and so do my family. I bought this CD because of the Hall and Oats Christmas song. I like the song and I think it's a great song for Christmas.  I am going to buy another CD with this song. I also like "All I Want for Christmas Is You" by Hall and Oats, but I have the Hall and Oats album which has a lot more songs, so I will probably buy that album as well if it's the same song. I liked the Hall and Oats Christmas song before, but now I like it so much I can't help but buy a copy of the Hall and Oats album.

Then I was surprised when I opened it to find that the cd is not in the format that it is suppose to be in. So I had to download it again to be able to listen to it. (I only listen to CDs).

Amazon review: I own several versions of this soundtrack, the first being the one released on CD (as was originally intended) which included two bonus tracks, and the second being the one I purchased on Amazon, which does not include anything.

Amazon review: Okay, I have to say that I was glad when I saw the CD cover and the album title. So far, I've listened to one song and it's the opening song, "Whip It". You know how songs in bands with a certain style tend to get repetitive and tiresome? Maybe that goes for pop/rock bands, but for some reason this was the first song on this CD that really grabbed me. I don't know why. At the end of the song, I was crying. I was so excited to hear more songs. But no more! I was hoping that the vocals would be improved because they were just a little hard for me. And they were a little hard to understand at the beginning. I was really going to like this album based on the beginning of the songs. But I just don't. It's like a mix of pop and rock music that didn't fit at all. I was disappointed after the opening song, "Whip It". I was disappointed after the next song, "Breathe." I was very disappointed after the next song, "I'm Sorry." I wasn't crazy about the rest of the songs. "I'm Sorry" was the only song that I understood completely. I didn't know what the song was about and I didn't have any idea what the artist's name was. And I was really disappointed when I finished the album. I really want to like this CD because it's a little different from Title. But I just don't. I feel like it's a little generic and boring too. I'll probably end up giving up on this CD before the end of the album. And I'm not even disappointed with the music genre. Maybe I'm just not a fan of rock and pop and jazz. I just wish I could make the songs different from the rest of the songs. I wanted to like this CD so much. I'll probably listen to it again when it comes out. I really hope that it's a better CD than Title. But I'm not holding my breath.

BubblingUnder Review

Rating:

I have to say, that I have not heard one of her songs that I do not like.

I have a very hard time choosing between her songs.

That said, this one is a little different than the other ones. I don't know if it's because she is singing in a different language or because it is a different style of song but it is very different from the other two.

For a song, I think this one is a little more uplifting, I know that she is singing about her feelings of love but I don't know if these lyrics are a great way to express it.

I think this one would be better for a man to hear.

For a man to listen to, I think this one would be a little more upbeat but maybe I am wrong.

I think this one is better than the other two.

The Good:

The song is quite different. I can't think of anything else I would want to hear by her.

The Bad:

There are some other songs on this album that I really like but this one does not fit in my top 5 or my top 10 or my top 10 of the top 10 songs.

The Ugly:

There is nothing ugly about this song.

The Bottom Line:

Singing in English, this is an amazing song.

This is a song that I would want to hear and it is a song that I would want to hear by any other artist.

I think this is a very unique song and I think that it is a song that I could see being sung by her in another country.

I think this song is very good and I think that I could see this being sung in several languages.

I think that she is a very talented singer.

Amazon review: This is the best album by an out-of-print emo band I have heard in a long time. Their new album "A World Without" is a return to form, full of heart but never sacrificing the emotional depth of their first two albums. The band has always seemed like a one-of-a-kind entity that has only existed in this small part of the world, and after listening to "A World Without" I feel like they've finally found themselves. I really like the way they've updated their sound to include elements of R&B, hip hop, and rock'n'roll while still maintaining the distinctiveness of their sound. This is a damn good album.  ***

(This review is for the "A World Without" CD)
I know that sometimes I get a little excited about a band just because they are from my area, but this is a band that is just awesome in general.  I like the way that they have always been able to make music that I could never recreate.  They have been one of the few to keep their sound fresh and new all the time.  I've always thought that they were doing something special and were making something that I really didn't think they could.  What does this band have to offer?  I think that there are too many variables to discuss in this review that simply can't be discussed.  I'm sure that a few of you will agree, but I'll just say this.  I've listened to some of their music, but I don't think I've listened to it with as much passion as I have with this album.  I've always liked them because of their live performance.  I've always loved their music, but for some reason I've always really been drawn to the band because of their live performance.  I think that their music is great.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
