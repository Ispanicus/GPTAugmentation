Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: I should have just bought the one song that I liked. The 3 songs on the radio are the only ones that are worth a S*, the rest of the album sucks. Which was quite surprising and disappointing coming from Katy Perry. I would recommend others to only buy the songs they like. and leave the rest.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wish I could give this 5 stars because I really do love the performances on this album. However, the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album. It's as if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone. It sounds really thin. That and the lack of a CD release and being stuck with a crappy MP3 format, I really can't give it more than 2 stars. This performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Amazing! I love all of this music. I would definitely recommend this to anyones collection. This is by far one of the best albums I have ever heard. Katy Perry's voice is amazing and there are some great songs on here. The lyrics are amazing and the songs are all very memorable. This is one incredible album that I highly recommend.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's quite an interesting album as the songs are very different. They are not all about love, but there are some good tunes. I like the songs the most, but the quality of the album is not the greatest. I gave it 4 stars because it is a good album but not one of the best.

Amazon review: Katy Perry is one of the most talented singers in the world. She is not afraid to try new things. This album is no exception. When she sings "I Don't Wanna Go Crazy" it's not a song about being crazy, it is a song about being on a rollercoaster. The album contains songs that are very different from each other but they all have something in common. Katy Perry is a very talented singer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Katy Perry has done it again!  This album of songs is filled with great vocals and great lyrics. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this album.

Amazon review: Katy Perry sings about the difficulties of love and the need to be reminded why we were meant to be. The album is filled with songs that are about friendship, and love for others.  There are many songs that have a message of love and are very different from one another.

Amazon review: I have been a Katy Perry fan since the first time I saw her perform in front of a small audience back in September 2007.  I have bought many Katy Perry albums to my collection, and this is one of my favorites.  She is not afraid to try new things and this album is no exception to that rule. So I am going to give this album 4 stars. The songs are all very good, and there are many songs on here that are very memorable.  I am hoping this album will not be as hard to find as her other albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: I don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with music. It's so pointless. Music is just a tool for the emotional mind. It's not supposed to make you happy or sad.  I am so tired of people coming to me with problems all the time, asking me what they should do and what they should listen to.  I don't know what to tell them.  They just need to stop listening to music because it's only supposed to be used for entertainment and not for your emotions.  I don't know why people take these things so seriously.  I don't know why people go to concerts, watch movies, or read books.  All these things affect your emotions.  Music is not supposed to do that.  The way music is used is the way it's supposed to be used.  Music is an instrument, not a religion.  Music is supposed to open your mind and the brain so then you can think about what you want to think about.  Music is supposed to make you happy; making you feel good; giving you a lift or a push.  It's not supposed to make you sad.  Music is supposed to inspire you.  It's supposed to make you want to feel good.  It's supposed to make you feel happy.  It's supposed to make you feel all that you feel.  I'm so tired of people taking what I say about music so seriously.  It is just music.  Music is just a tool.  It's just like using a hammer as a tool.  It's just a tool.  It doesn't have to be used for anything.  It's a tool.  Music is a tool and it's supposed to be used.  It's not supposed to be used for anything else.  It's just supposed to be used.  I'm sick and tired of people talking about music and how much they love music and how much they want to listen to music and how much they want to be happy and how much they want to be better people because of what they listen to.  It's just a tool.  Music is a tool and it's supposed to be only used as a tool and not as a religion.  I don't know why so many people are obsessed with music.  Music is a tool.  Nothing more and nothing less.  It's just a tool.  I'm sick and tired of these people coming to me all the time with problems all the time, asking me what they should do and what to listen to and what they should do and what to listen to and what to do and what to listen to and what to do and what to do and what to listen to.  I don't know what to tell you.  They just need to stop listening to music because it's only used for entertainment and not for your emotions.  I don't know what to tell you.  They just want to listen to music.  They just want to listen to music.  They just want it to help them with their problems.  They just want it to help them with their problems.   They just want to listen to music.  They just want it for fun.  I don't know why they even need it.  It's just a tool.  It's just a tool.  It's not supposed to be used for anything.  Music is not supposed to help you with anything.  Music is meant to be used only as a tool and not used for anything else.   It's just supposed to be used and not used.  It's just a tool.  It's just a tool and it's supposed to be used for entertainment.  It's just a tool and not used for anything else.  It's just a tool.

Amazon review: No banjo. I was simply disappointed by the overall sound. I loved Mumford's first album, and thought the second one was just as good if not better. I was very excited to receive this CD the first day it came out, but after listening to it three times end to end, I felt bored. After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it. I hold out hope that the group makes a 4th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original two CDs so terrific.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: Stanley Climbfall had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on "No Name Face". Talk about a Sophmore slump! The first singe "Spin" is pretty good, as is the title track. The best track on the record is "Take Me Away", it is BEAUTIFUL! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd. that's junk!

Amazon review: For those interested in getting an understanding of country music, it's really quite an achievement to compile a compilation of all the songs that have been recorded by one artist. I believe that the material on this CD is very good, not just for the songs but for the artists as well. From Jim Reeves to Tim Buckley to Jerry Douglas to Emmylou Harris to Waylon Jennings to George Jones to Merle Haggard to George Strait to The Oak Ridge Boys to Willie Nelson to The Statler Brothers to John Anderson to Patsy Cline to The Statler Brothers to James Cleveland to Jimmie Rodgers to Loretta Lynn to John Prine to Waylon Jennings to Johnny Cash to Johnny Cash to Conway Twitty to Conway Twitty to Conway Twitty to Conway Twitty to ConwayTwitty to Conway Twitty to Conway Twitty to ConwayTwitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to ConwayTwitty to Twitty to Twitty to TwitTw to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twitty to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twity to Twitty to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twit to Twit to Twist to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twitty to Twit to Twit to Twitty to Twit to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twitty to Twity to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twit to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twit to Twity to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twit to Twity to Twitty to Twitty to Twity to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twity to Twitty to Twit to Twitty to Twitty to Twity to Twitty to Twity to Twitty to Twitty to Twity to Twit to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twity to Twity to Twitty to Twit to Twitty to Twity to Twiit to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty toTwitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty, to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twiit to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty toTwitty to Twiity to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty toTwiitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty toTwit to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twiitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty,to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twitty to Twitty to Twitty to twiitty, to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twitty,to Twit, to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twitty, toTwitty, to Twitty, to Twitty,to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twit, to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twitty to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twitty, to Twit, to Twitty.

Amazon review: I have always thought that this guy was a genius. The man could write some wicked lyrics, the music and arrangements are simply stunning. His style, in my opinion, is much more suited for the country side of things, but some of the slower stuff is quite enjoyable. My only complaint is that it would have been better had he chosen a better singer to back up his lyrics, perhaps one with a bit more range?

Amazon review: The most overrated album by any band in years.  I heard it for the first time this past Saturday and I just couldn't believe how bad it was.  I know that there were a few songs that were good, but I don't think it's on par with some of the other great albums of the first season.  I'm not even sure that I can call it a first or second album.  I know it's the second album, but you need to have an album that's good to be a first album at all.  There are a few filler tracks that are good, but the songs that are just not good at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I loved this album the album but I didn't think the band would make a second album.  I was wrong.  This is the album that made me fall in love with the band again.  The songs are what make the album great.  The band is still better than the first album, but they have improved over the years.  I have this album on CD and will probably put it on my iPod when I get a chance.  I will never buy a band CD ever again.  If you love the sound of the band, you'll love this album.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: The problem with getting the previews is that they never let you hear the ends of song.  I don't know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album, but several of the songs have the last note or two cut off, either completely or right in the middle of a note.  Not a lot of joy there.  I will say that there are some songs on the album that are fine, but getting slammed like that really ruins everything.  I'll probably go through the album again and remove these songs from my device.

Amazon review: I brought this CD off of impulse and I was little naive because I didn't do my research. I give this album a "2" because it has a couple new tracks, but there are only 7 and most are from his FREE mixtape.  You can get his mixtape "So Far Gone" for FREE, online which has 17 tracks and is a lot better. It has good track flow, Great production and basically professionally put together just be a "mixtape".  I have a feeling the record company released this EP to make some type of profit off of Drake's popularity.

I mean, seriously, there is a lot of talent in this country.  I've been to two major sporting events in one day and two concerts.  I can't believe I'm writing this.  I've never been to a concert by myself and I'm pretty sure I'm going to meet my heros during the upcoming trip to Nashville.

Amazon review: I like this album.  The songs are decent and flow well.  They all have different styles and they all have great production.  Overall, I give this album a "3" star rating.

Amazon review: This is the best album of the year.  The songs are great and the talent is undeniable.  I love the fact that they use a rapper name for each song.  I've been listening to this album on repeat for over an hour.  I don't know how but I've been able to get through the entire album in one sitting.  It's a great album!

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Drake albums.  I really like how the songs are mixed from the various genres.  I feel like this album is more of a concept album with each song representing a different part of his life.  It's a great album that has great production and it's my most favorite Drake album so far.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to give this album a 4 star rating.  Every song has a story on it, even if you don't know the story.  The production is on point and the story is interesting.  The song "Turn Up The Music" was written by Drake and it really shows his growth as an artist.  The story on that song is really cool and it really connects with my life at the time.  I would recommend this album to anyone with an interest in rap and Drake.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: These are the best songs by Drake.  I love his music and I love his story.  I don't know how he does it, but he does.  I've listened to the entire album over and over again.  I'm going to download the whole album for my new iphone, hoping that I'll be able to listen to it on the go and not have to worry about the battery.

Amazon review: I love this album!  That is all I can say.  As a rap fan, I was expecting to hear the usual Drake songs, however, the album features a lot more than that.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album multiple times.  It is amazing, the best album of the year so far.  The production is great and the lyrics are amazing.  The only thing is the album is extremely long, but it is worth it.  I love this album because it is a compilation of different songs and it really shows how talented Drake is.  Each song is different and the album really shows his growth as an artist.  The only thing that I don't like about the album is that it is a compilation of several artist from different genres.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

Amazon review: If you are looking for Bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band, this CD is for you. It will remind you of "Tom Goad", which I actually own but have not seen since the first and only time I played it. Though,  I have listened to Springsteen for twenty years, I am not a fan of his pre  "Dark Side of Town" work. I never cared for Dylan and I do not  like any of Springsteen's solo work. If you like BUSA, etc, you will  not like this CD. Some of this material could have been interesting if they  had been recorded as rock songs.

Amazon review: I have found this CD to be very interesting.  While there are a few ballads on this album,  it is the ballads that draw the listener in.  Songs like "The Moon on the Water",  "The Love That Kills" and "Love 'em All" are very  good.  I am not a fan of the ballads on this album,  but "The Moon on the Water" is the one ballad I could  listen to all day.

Amazon review: If you have not heard this album yet, do yourself a favor and get it.  This will be one of the best albums you will hear all year.  It does not have a "perfect" album, but it is one that you will grow to like and one that will keep you listening to it for a long time.  The instrumentals are very good.  I have heard the vocals on this album and I think they are very good.  I am very impressed with the female vocalists on this album.  They are not just singers who croon, they are singers who sing in harmony with each other.  The only time I've heard a more perfect vocal harmonies was on the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".  There is no doubt about it.  These singers are great.

Amazon review: This is another great album from The Bangles.  I have not heard a CD that has such a diverse and great collection of songs.  Most of the songs are quite good, but there are a few that are forgettable.  The instrumentals are very good.  It is a very interesting album.

Amazon review: This is not a perfect album.  The songs are good, but they are not what you would call "perfect".  The instrumentals are good, but the vocals are not the best.

I suppose that is why it is on my "to listen" list.

Amazon review: This is the most varied album I have found by this group.  It takes you on a journey through the mind of rock and roll.  I suppose it is also a good example of how to mix up a collection of songs.  The instrumentals are good.  The vocals are not the best.  The ballads are good.  I really like one of the ballads,  "The Moon on the Water".  I am glad I discovered this album.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed the album.  It is very different and very well done.  The instrumentals are a bit inconsistent, but they do not detract from the overall product.  I really do not care for the ballads.  They are not bad, but I do not think this is the best album by The Bangles.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  The instrumentals are very good and the vocals are very good.  The instrumentals are the main reason that I have started this album.  The vocals are very good and the instrumentals are good, but I have not been able to find the songs that I like.  I do not feel like this is the best Bangles album.  If you like your music simple,  this is not the album for you.  The vocals on the instrumentals are very good and the instrumentals are good.  I do not care for the ballads.  The songs sound alike to me.  I do not think the album is a good one for the price.  If you can find a better Bangles album at a lesser price,  please let me know.  I can tell you that I have not found one.

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a huge Weezy F. Sheen fan, but I've always been a fan of hip-hop and I think this is probably one of the best hip-hop albums on the planet.  If you're a hip-hop fan, don't listen to this CD.  If you're a hip-hop fan, listen to this album.  If you're a hip-hop fan, listen to this CD.  I've listened to the album a few times and I've never heard anything that would cause me to change my mind.  The lyrics and production are incredible and I can't recommend this record enough.

Amazon review: I'm new to hip-hop and I love it. I've listened to all the albums by 2pac, Nas, Biggie, Tupac, and Lil Wayne and the only ones that stand out for me are Jay-Z and Weezy F. Sheen. It's a shame that music isn't more accessible, but I really don't care about that. I just like the music.  I'm not going to make a huge speech about how we need to change the way we approach music, but I do like the fact that rap is more accessible.  You're probably going to get a lot of people that are going to flip out and yell at you because they don't like your music, but I don't care.  I like hip-hop, I just don't like the music that's on the radio. All of the music I like is going to be on the radio, if not on my iPod.

Amazon review: This is an album where I was very disappointed. I have listened to the whole album several times and I am still not satisfied.  First of all, the singing is horrible.  I thought I was able to hear the lyrics perfectly but it was a little too muffled.  My second problem with the album is that the lyrics are nothing special.  If you're into "emo" or "punk" then it's a good album.  If you're not then it's just another average rock CD.  The only good thing about this album is the fact that it's still very popular.

I listen to all of the songs and they all sound great. The lyrics are great as well. I love the song "Mama's House" which talks about women who don't treat men right. I love the song "The Rain" which talks about how the sky is falling. The song "I'm a Goner" is about a guy who died and he was killed by his own girlfriend. The last song is a great song called "The Black Man" which talks about how you can't really be a black man unless you are in the middle of a war in some African country. I just loved this album. It's the best CD I have ever heard. I hope it

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: I gave this a listen.  A friend of mine knows I'm a big fan of Frank, etc, so he thought I'd like this.  But, like so many young guys out there trying to sing like Sinatra (I'm looking at YOU, Mike Buble!), they fail because they have no heart. Now, technically, Seth is a good singer.  I don't particularly care for his singing voice, but obviously he's got some talent there.  I almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover.  I'd like it more if they weren't trying so hard to invoke the images of Frank's old LP covers.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the band.  I've been listening to them since I was 8 years old.  I was surprised this album is so bad.  They're so bad that it's actually funny, because I've been giving them a hard time all of my life.  When I first discovered them I just thought they were the most boring, boring band ever.  I could not understand the lyrics.  How could anyone not know the meaning of the songs?  As if they were all just pop songs.  I was so mad.  I couldn't understand the lyrics.  I couldn't understand what the band was singing.  It was like hearing a commercial jingle, or an ad.  I was like, "Why is the band trying to be so darned good?  What the hell is going on?"  And that was my problem with the band from the beginning.  I couldn't understand them.  They couldn't understand me.

I can't believe that they sing a song called "I like your style" (no, I don't hear any of that shit on the radio.).  I can't believe that this song is called "Where's the Love" when the band is pretty much the same as the rest of the world.  I can't believe that they have a song called "Ride On" when it's nothing more than a white guy telling his black friend that he should ride on a white horse, who is then killed in a tragic accident.  I can't believe that this is a song called "All About Me."  I can't believe that they have a song called "Why is my baby crying?"  I can't believe that this is a song called "I am a better man" when it's about a black man murdering his wife and then murdering his daughter.  I can't believe that this is a song called "Heaven" when it was written as a song to get his ex back.  I can't believe that they have a song called "I'm Not There" when the band is from the same town as the guy who wrote "Heaven."  I can't believe that this is a song called "Dancing in the Street" when it's about a white man who is telling a black man that he should dance in a white man's street.  I can't believe that this is a song called "If you don't like black men" when it's about a black man who hates white men, but is trying to show the white man that he does like black men if he helps him get a white woman.  I can't believe that this is a song called "I don't want to be friends with you" when it's about a black man who hates white men, but wants to be friends with white men so he can do them favors.  I can't believe that this is a song called "Why don't you leave me alone?"  I can't believe that this is a song called "Ride on" when the band is the most boring white band ever.  I can't believe that this is a song called "Where's the Love" when it's a white man telling a black man that he should ride on a white horse, who is then killed in an accident.  I can't believe that this is a song called "He's a Man" when it's about a black man who wants to be a successful businessman, but doesn't go out and get a job making $60,000 a year at a law firm.  I can't believe that this is a song called "All about me."  I can't believe that this is a song called "Dance on" when the guy that wrote this song is the most boring white guy ever.  I can't believe that this is a song called "I'm not there" when the band is from the same town as the guy that wrote this song.  I can't believe that this is a song called "He is a man" when the black man who was murdered is not dead.  I can't believe that this is a song called "I am better" when the band is trying to say that the black man is better than the white man.  I can't believe that this is a song called "I need you" when the guy who wrote this song is trying to get out of his marriage to a white girl, but doesn't want a black girl.

Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: I am a fan of U2 and I was so excited to hear this CD!  But, the music is so hard to understand and the production sounds like the studio didn't even try to make anything sound good.  All the instrumentation sounds almost the same...  I would recommend this CD to people who are a fan of U2. There are a few more songs that are worth listening to.  But, I am disappointed with how hard it is to understand the songs.  It is so difficult to figure out what is going on at times.  But I have to give you credit, because it is really good music!  So, I am going to take this recommendation and use it as motivation to figure out how to play guitar better and try to improve my song writing skills.  I am going to work on this and I will make a new CD someday!  I will even give this CD to my grandkids!

Amazon review: I bought this CD at a local music store for my 9-year-old son.  I was a little nervous to pick it up, because his teacher already recommended it to me, but I was excited to listen to it with him.  I was amazed at what this cd sounded like.  I thought it had more of a rock and roll sound to it, but it was more of a pop/rock/art rock sound.  The lyrics are very simple and easy to understand.  I would recommend this CD to any little kid and adults.  I would buy this again.

Amazon review: This was a great CD for my nine year old daughter. She liked it very much.  I was not surprised at all.  She would listen to the lyrics and sing along to the songs.

I would have liked the song "I Believe" better.  I think I would rather listen to a CD with more songs I like rather than a CD with a song that I don't like.  I am not really a fan of all the songs on this cd.  I just don't like some of the songs.  And, I have some other CDs that I like better.  This CD is about the only CD I have of this artist that I like.  But, the others are very good.

I think this song is great.  It's a fun song that has a catchy chorus, and the guitar solo just drives the song.  The lyrics are simple and direct, and so is the message that the singer is trying to convey.

The guitar solo is great.  I like how the guitar solo is played in the background.  There is no guitar solo before the chorus.  The solo has a great flow and is very much connected to the song.  It's nice when a guitar solo doesn't come in the middle of a song where it is just a distraction.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review: If you are looking for Bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band, this CD is for you. It will remind you of "Tom Goad", which I actually own but have not seen since the first and only time I played it. Though,  I have listened to Springsteen for twenty years, I am not a fan of his pre  "Dark Side of Town" work. I never cared for Dylan and I do not  like any of Springsteen's solo work. If you like BUSA, etc, you will  not like this CD. Some of this material could have been interesting if they  had been recorded as rock songs.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: I have been patiently waiting for this album!  With the release of the Deluxe Edition, we are finally getting back to the sound of the original album from the 1960s.  This release is a must have for any Beatles fan!  Not only does it sound like the original album, but it contains some of the rare and unreleased songs as well.  The songs are still very much what you'd expect from the Beatles, but I do wish they had included the entire "Let It Be" album.

Amazon review: The first time I heard the new album, I thought, "How can I possibly be happy with this?"  The entire collection sounded the same.  All I heard was a lot of the same songs over and over again.  I bought this album hoping that there would be a new sound, but I was still really disappointed.  But, then, I think I was just in shock at how great the songs really were.  The new album is an awesome set of songs.  I think my favorite song is "Mother's Little Helper".  I think it's one of the best songs on the entire album.  I love the way it sounds in the album and on the CD.  I like the new Beatles sound.  I like the way the CD feels in my pocket.  I love the songs in the album, and I love the songs on the CD.  I love the songs in the original album, so I have mixed feelings about re-releasing this entire collection.  However, I feel that I must release this collection because it was one of the last albums to be released in the 1960s, and it was a huge hit!  To me, this collection of songs is the best Beatles collection ever made.  It truly is a definitive collection of great songs that never sounded the same way twice.  The album is filled with great songs that are totally true to the Beatles' sound.  You can't find the Beatles songs like this anywhere else.  I have never heard music like this in any other Beatles album.  It is a great piece of music.  I can't see any reason why a Beatles fan would want to purchase this album and not the original album which contains all the songs.  So, please, buy the original album so that you can have a complete collection from the Beatles.

I have loved the songs on this album since I saw The Beatles play at the old Cavern Club in Liverpool.  I still feel the same way after hearing a new album by the Beatles.  I don't know what it is that makes these songs so great.  When I listen to the original album, I love it, but when I listen to the new album, I love it more.  I feel as if I've had the chance to hear two different albums and they are just so fantastic.  The songs are so great and it's like two different albums that are the same.  I can't say that I love this album more than the original album, but I can say that I would buy this album for a friend or for myself!

Amazon review: This song was one day I was on my way to work, I got a phone call from my boss saying someone has been fired from our company. He said I would have to go to work. I got to work early that day and when I came into the office everybody was sitting around the table waiting for me. All my co-workers were looking at me like "what did you do now?". They called my friend who was there with me so she came and sat with me. I told her I was fired so I had to go work. It was the night before Thanksgiving so I had to leave. So I drove my car back to my house. I drove it through the garage and all the way through the house and parked it in my driveway. I sat there with the car for about 5 minutes and then I just sat there. I had my phone with me with me and called my mom and told her I was fired. I told her I was going to go to work and leave for work. I got in the car and turned the ignition and off the car and hit the gas and left. I got to work and my boss told me I was fired. That was the last time I ever saw her. I went to work and got on the elevator and when I got to the upper floor I pushed the button for the second floor and went down the first floor and sat down at my desk. I went to my manager and told him I was fired. He said "why are you leaving?" I told him I was going to work. He said "wait a minute, you can't leave cause your boss fired you". I said I was fired and he said "no I fired you" I asked him why he fired me and he said he had decided he no longer wanted me working for the company. He told me "if you want to work here you will have to change and I can't do that. You're fired" He told me I could leave and go do whatever I wanted. I quit. So I quit. The day I quit I went to a doctor and told him I had a migraine. He said "you need to go to the emergency room and get your migraines checked out". I went to the emergency room and stayed for about an hour and a half, they gave me some medication and went to tell my doctor. He said "you need to go buy a gun and come back". That was the last time I ever saw him. I bought a gun and came back on November 27th. I came back and went to work. I got on the elevator and when I got to the upper floor I pushed that button for the second floor and went down the first floor and sat down and waited for the elevator. When it came back I took the gun from the manager and fired at the door, hitting him in the stomach. He said he was going to fire me, but I talked him into not doing it. I fired my gun at the door and the door came off and hit me in the head right in the left temple and I fell on the floor. And he said I am going to kill you. I said "not yet you are fired." He said I was fired. I got up and walked out of the office. I walked to my car and went home. I got in my car and turned the ignition and off the car and hit the gas and drove home. I walked in my house and said to my mom "I need to leave for work" and I left. That was the last time I ever saw her. I got to work and got on the elevator and when

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.
