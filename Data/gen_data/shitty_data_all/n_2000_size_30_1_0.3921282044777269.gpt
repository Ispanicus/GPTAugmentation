Amazon review: This song was written by Todd Rundgren.  Hall and Oats are good but Todd the best,I think he produced them along with Patti Smith ( Here comes the night ) and lots of other artists.  Most of their big hits were written by Todd.

Amazon review: Barefootin was on there, which is not the song we were after. We wanted Lets Go Baby, which was supposed to the B side, but instead it was Mountain of Love by Harold something or another. It came from a series of "collectibles".

Amazon review: I just finished downloading (from the cloud) and there's a problem.  Four of the tracks will not play on Windows Media Player or on Winamp (on a Windows XP system). The bad tracks are:  (disc 1) track 04  (disc 1) track 08  (disc 2) track 10  (disc 2) track 13 If I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist. If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!  I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.

Amazon review: I don't know if I'm the only one who doesn't like this album.  There are a couple songs that I really like.  Tracks 3 and 5 are my favorite.  I've listened to this album several times and I still think the lyrics are really dumb.  I mean, I don't know who wrote these lyrics.  I know somebody wrote the lyrics for this song but I don't think it was Todd.  I'm not going to waste your time with this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the first albums I downloaded and listened to.  I thought it was great.  I didn't know it was by Todd Rundgren.  It was a hard copy (I think it was a stereo record).  If you don't know who Todd Rundgren is, you should know who he is.  I don't know who he is, but I do know that he is one of the great songwriters of the 1970's.  So I downloaded several songs by him.  This one was good.  You have to listen to it for yourself.  I will say that a lot of the lyrics are really dumb.  I don't know who wrote the lyrics.  I guess I'm not going to waste your time with this one.  I will say this:  If you're not a fan of his music, I would get this one and listen to it.  It is really great.  If you're a fan of his music, then I would get this one and listen to it.  It is really good.  It is definitely worth getting.  I would say this is one of the best albums I've ever listened to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is called "Todd Rundgren and His New York All Stars"  It's a great album, except that they didn't write the lyrics.  They should have called it "Todd Rundgren and His New York All Stars Sing a Hard Rock Version of "Love Potion Number 9."  But that was the lyrics I listened to and liked.  If they sang that, they would have had to cut a lot of words.  I think this album is a lot better than the "Todd Rundgren and His New York All Stars" album.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this yet, but I know that it is a good album.  The lyrics are really dumb.  I don't know who wrote the lyrics, but it is one of the few songs I haven't listened to yet that I know the lyrics to.  I would like to get it.  There's a whole bunch of other songs that I want to listen to, but I haven't gotten around to listening to them.  I don't know why.  I'm not that good at remembering albums.

Amazon review: This album has some good songs.  I like the song "The Only True Love" because it was the song that did so well on the radio.  I also like the song "Love Potion Number 9".  I'm not sure why I like this song.  It's probably because I like the song "Love Potion Number 9".  There are probably other songs I like better, but I don't remember them.  It's possible that I don't like them because I don't know the lyrics.  I don't know what the songs about.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has no talent.  They are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible.  If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.

Amazon review: This is some good music, right here! LaRue is a vocal beast. I had the pleasure of being at the live recording and I was blown away with her vocals, the background vocals and the band. Everything was on point. The music as easy to follow and I didn't feel cheated when it came to ministry. Although it was the recording for her CD, she still stayed with the ministry element and tears were flowing, hands were praised, and praises were being given to The Father.

The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: This is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the LP.  It is complete with tics and pops.  The sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording.  I thought I was getting a good copy from the original master tapes and was very disgusted with the sound.  My worn cassette copy was much better.  I would give it a zero for the rating if I could.  The performance is wonderful and exciting, but badly mangled by the transfer.  Do not buy this under any circumstances.

Amazon review: Another great compilation of the best and most innovative British rock music of the time.  The best example is probably a song called "The First Cut Is The Deepest Cut" which describes a song from Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, complete with its "ooh-ooh" sound effects.  This is a truly superb collection of music.  The track listing is excellent, and the liner notes are a must read.  There are a few things to be aware of.  First the track numbers are in descending order, so the first track is #1.  Second is that the track numbers do not correspond to the actual order of tracks in the vinyl, so the last track may be track #11.  And third, many of the titles are listed in the liner notes as "Favourite Song" and not as the actual song title.  This is to avoid copyright infringement, which, in my opinion, is a big reason for this record being pirated.  The only way to obtain a legitimate copy of this CD is to buy it from the original distributor, Sky Records, which I have done.  However, if you have any problems with the transfer of the CD to your computer, I recommend you purchase a digital copy from Amazon.com, and then upload it to a file sharing network like Rapidshare.com or Share-it.com.  This will make the transfer much safer.  I believe you will be able to obtain a much better copy of the album from your source of purchase, but this is a different kind of music.  I have given a full review of Amazon.com's service, which I highly recommend.

Amazon review: This is another great compilation of rock music including a track from the band that would eventually become Yes.  The liner notes are also a great read, and make for a great listen.  There are a couple of things to be aware of.  The track listings are not in chronological order, as the order in the original vinyl will not correspond to the order on the digital CD.  Also, many of the track names are listed as "Favourite Song" and not as the actual song title, which is to avoid copyright infringement.  The only way to obtain a legitimate copy of this CD is by buying it from the original distributor, Sky Records, which I have done. However, if you have any problems with the transfer of the CD to a computer, I recommend you purchase a digital copy from Amazon.com, which I have done.  This is another great compilation of rock music, although it is a different style to the other two compilations I have already reviewed.  However, if you have any problems with the transfer of the audio to a computer, I recommend you purchase a digital copy from Amazon.

Amazon review: This is the first of two albums by the band Led Zeppelin.  The liner notes are a must read, and there are good track listings.  The sound quality is somewhat poor, and the liner notes make for a great read.  There are a couple of things to be aware of.  First the track titles are listed as "Favourite Track" and not as the actual track titles, which is to avoid copyright infringement.  Second, there are a couple of misprint errors on the track listings, which will be corrected in the next edition.  The only way to obtain a legitimate copy of this CD is through the original distributor, Capitol, which I have done.  However, if you have any problems transferring the CD to a computer, I recommend you purchase a digital copy from www.amazon.com, which I have done.

Amazon review: I love this album. Favorites include Anthem, Run, Outlaws, Scared, Chasing Twisters, and My Whole Life Long. After It All makes me weep with joy.

I still remember the first CD that I purchased was "Christmas Is Here Again".  I did not know that I needed to have two Christmas CDs.  I was very excited about the Christmas CD I got.  I had the CD with me when I went to the post office the day after Christmas to mail the package.  I listened to this CD over and over and over.  I have not had a Christmas CD for a very long time.  I have not listened to a Christmas CD for quite a while.  This Christmas CD was a wonderful gift to my family.  I have listened to it over and over.  My husband and children really love it.

Amazon review: I love the song.  I think the lyrics make for an excellent song, and the music is nice. I think the lyrics are not always appropriate for the music/video clip. I would have liked to have seen more of the video, the graphics were nice, but it could have been better.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this very disappointing album. The album has a lot of pop elements and none of them work. The music is really nothing to write home about. It is really just okay. I was hoping for something that was more in the vein of my older songs but this album is just not good enough. I think you could get a lot more fans with some of the other bands out there. I don't know what they are doing or why they are doing it but it is just not getting their name more recognition. I don't think I will be purchasing any of their albums again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a collection of pop songs that are not really a part of "country" music. The lyrics are so stupid I just don't understand why they are so stupid. They tell a little girl that she needs to be a boy, they tell a guy that he needs to be a girl and even give him an explanation as to why. They are just all so silly. I am glad that I bought this album so I could give it to my son.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I purchased this album because the first track I heard was a song I love called "All I Need Is Love" by Whitney Houston. The song is about a woman who is told she needs to be a man.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album at Amazon because of the reviews.

It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: Im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the members of this band, that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war. This song and its lyrics are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience, and a shame to the troops especially those who have served in combat. Per this band  clearly troops in combat have no morals or self control, and were mostly just complacent killers.

Amazon review: I'm a huge matisyahu follower, and listen to ever other album he has released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like. I'll keep it simple, this is what happens when amazing unique artists go pop and mainstream. I like the song sunshine a lot, but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beats and effects. It's pretty depressing I'm writing this review right now.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would have to say that they've got the best job ever. I love the whole vibe that they have going on. Not to mention the fact that they are the only band on this entire CD that actually sounds like the original version of the Beatles, which makes me feel better about all the cheesy 80's dance music that I'm listening to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: So yeah, I like this CD alot. It's not my favorite, but I like it. It's very diverse. I don't really like any of the bands on this CD. I really like the vocals, especially the female voice. It fits very well with the rest of the music on this CD. All in all, I like this CD alot.

Amazon review: I feel like there are a few bands that could make a good band. I mean, this group might be one. This band could be the band I want to be when I grow up. I can see why it wasn't as popular when it first came out. It's not as good as I thought it would be, but I'm still enjoying it. If I was to describe this band, I'd say a lot of different influences and elements are mixed together to create a very good sounding group. I love the vocals and the overall sound of the group.

Amazon review: Most of the music starts out okay but then in the middle it gets loud and takes on a jazzy type sound which doesn't do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep.  Of course the samples that are given don't let you know that.  Worst 1.99 I have spent.  May not seem like a lot to Amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window.  Amazon can do that with it's own money.  I won't purchase another music from them.

Amazon review: I bought this to go with my cd of "Love" by The Carpenters.  I got a few CDs because I had to listen to the "Love" CD and the CD of "My Best Friend's Girl" by James Taylor.  I guess I got tired of listening to just those two songs.  I listened to this CD and then the Carpenters CD and then I just deleted the CD that had the The Carpenters CD in it.  I really like the CD of The Carpenters.  I guess I liked this very much.  I will go back and listen to it again.  I would give it a 3.  I could have bought the CD of the Carpenters but I liked that CD more.  I guess I am just a bit spoiled.  Other than that I really liked this CD and I liked the song I heard on it.

Amazon review: It's a very unusual song.  I don't know how to explain it but that's what it sounds like.  It was a little hard to understand some of the words and the chorus was a little hard to understand but I did like the rest of it and I have listened to the whole song over 50 times.

Amazon review: This is a good song, it's not a bad song, but it is one that will leave you feeling dissatisfied.  It's kind of a "Bachman Turner Overdrive" type of song.  The song was not what I expected, it was a good song, just one that I don't know if I would purchase again.

Amazon review: I downloaded this file from a friend and I can't believe I never thought of this.  This song is just fantastic.  It is a little slow for my taste but it is so good, I just feel like listening to this all the time.  Even after I finished listening to it I will do it again.  It is just perfect.  I would give this a 5.  I am only 21 years old so I am just a baby in my world of music.  I listen to this on my CD player and I have my MP3 player with me and I am just going to continue to read my CD's and maybe listen to an oldies station so I can listen to this at least once a week.  I like this song more than anything I have heard on a CD so far.  I don't know if I will purchase it again.  I am just going to keep it for my own.

I don't know if I have mentioned this before but I like music.  I can't get enough of it and it is really hard to get through a whole album and only listen to one song.  I will give this a 5.  This song just sounds like a song I would have heard in the movie.  I like the way it ends.  I like all of the songs in this album except for maybe the last one which is a little long but it is still a great song.

Amazon review: A good song with lots of great vocals.  I like this song.  The main problem is, that it is hard to listen to.  I guess it is the vocals.

I don't really know why this song was so slow.  I have listened to it over 50 times and I will listen to it again.  I really like the song and it has great vocals.  I would give this song a 5.

Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I was pretty disappointed with this album. I was expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work I'd been seeing on her videos. It just wasn't there for me. I will still play it but it won't be one of my favorites. My advice would be get a new producer.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of David Lee Roth since the early 80's.  I have listened to his solo work numerous times and was quite taken with his vocal abilities and the way he sings.  This album is no different.  I have to say, he is the worst singer in the world.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the music of this album.  I think it's more of the same sound of Van Halen as the last one, but with a little bit more guitar and drums.  I like the different sound, so far.  The one thing that didn't work was the drummer.  The way he handled the beats wasn't right.  It's not that he's bad, it's just that he wasn't doing it right.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Oh, wow!!!  What a great album to come home to after a long day at the office.  The lyrics are just as bad as the music.  It's just so annoying that you cannot get the lyrics to be read.  They just don't make sense.  I will listen to some of these songs on my way to work.  It just doesn't make sense.

Amazon review:  This is a must have for any Van Halen fan.  I've bought and given it 5 stars before, but I think it's time to change it to an 8.  The vocals are great, the riffs are great, and the overall sound is great.  It's everything Van Halen and their fans have become accustomed to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is the best of the three, in my opinion.  It's not perfect, but it's everything I believe David Lee Roth is supposed to be.  It has everything I love about the Van Halen sound and the vocals are great, especially the chorus.  I would have rated it 7.5 stars, but I have to give it 5 stars.  It has everything that I need from a Van Halen album.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to the whole album yet, but I have listened to a few songs already.  I have to admit, they sound good.  I think this is one of the most consistent albums that I have heard.  It has that Van Halen sound, a few new things, and a few old things thrown in.  I like this album more and more.  It's the best one I've heard from the band.

Amazon review: If you've never heard this band before, you'll love this album.  It's just that good.  It's got the songs that you love and like, but there are also a few songs that you'll not like.  This album is great for those that love the Van Halen sound, but not necessarily the lyrics.  This is just a great album.  It's not a bad album, because there are some great songs on it, but it just doesn't have the best lyrics.  I'm sure there will be more Van Halen albums with better lyrics.

This album is the best Van Halen album, and I will definitely buy it when it comes out.  I can't wait to hear the lyrics, because they are so bad that you just can't understand them.

Amazon review: There are a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation, this album is just as good or better. WHAT?!  If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.  If a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldn't be bluegrass.  When U2 decided to go electronica on their Pop album it sucked.  That's what this is.

The guitar solo is in the middle of the album and is one of the best guitar solos you will hear.  The song "Wherever I May Roam" is very short and not worth listening to all the way through.  The song "I've Never Been to San Francisco" is very nice, but after the guitar solo it just fades.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When I first heard this album, I was very impressed with Mark Knopfler's playing and the song "The Eye/Wherever I May Roam" stood out to me as one of his best songs.  He is a very talented guy and I couldn't agree with you more.  The guitar solo is amazing and really sets the tone for the song, and after that the song goes downhill.  As a matter of fact, I would say the song was average at best.  When it comes down to it, this album is average.  It is a good album with a good guitar solo, and Tom did write some good songs, but I just don't get it and find this album boring and very average. I would recommend the album to anyone who likes Mark Knopfler's music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I loved Mark Knopfler's first album "Surf's Up!".  I thought it was a great album.  I liked the songs on this album except the song "California".  The song is too short and simple. It doesn't bring out the emotion like the rest of the album.  I hope there will be a second album.  I will buy it and give it a good review.  I am glad there is a second album and really hope it is good!  I liked Mark Knopfler, his music is great.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just ordered this album.  I like Mark Knopfler and I like this album.  The songs are great and the band is good.  I like the guitar solos and the songs, "Wherever I May Roam" is one of my favorites and "I've Never Been to San Francisco" is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I don't know what it is but whenever I listen to Mark Knopfler, I just get so drawn in to the music.  This is one of those albums that really gets me emotionally.  The guitar solo in "The Eye/"Wherever I May Roam" really draws me in.  The album is a very good one and I like the songs on it.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Mark Knopfler's music.
###
Amazon review: I've never listened to Mark Knopfler's music before, and the only CDs I have are his first two albums.  Then I found this CD and I was totally blown away.  I started with "Surf's Up!" and I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of talent and emotion in the songs.  After that I went with "Wherever I May Roam" which is a slower, more laid back song.  I really enjoyed the guitar solo on "The Eye/Wherever I May Roam".  The only problem is that it's the only song on the album that I didn't like.  I think it's because it is one of the shortest songs on the album but it is still a great song.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Mark Knopflers music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love Mark Knopfler's music, but I was really disappointed with his latest CD "Wherever I May Roam".  The album is very boring, I know it's his 3rd album but it doesn't seem to be his best work.  The songs are mostly average to me.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Mark Knopfleers

Amazon review: For some reason, the music has a very "musical" sound, like a string ensemble.  I don't know why, but there is nothing else going on in the background that you can hear.  You can't even hear the music on the CD, it is just a very musical sound and I don't like it.  I don't know why the CD producers thought it a good idea to do that!  It is not a good idea.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the previous discs as well as the newest.  I still like all of them.  I just can't see the point of paying for a CD that has a bunch of new songs that you've never heard before and that aren't representative of the previous albums.  If you buy a CD with 5 songs, you buy 5 songs.  If you buy a CD with 5 songs, you buy 5 CDs.  If you buy a CD with 5 CDs, you buy 5 CDs.  The same thing goes with books.  If you buy a book with 2 pages, you get two pages.  A book with 5 pages, you get five books.  And if you want a book with 6 pages, you buy a book with 6 pages.  This is why it is always best to buy the best-selling version of a book and read it.  I can't understand why the publishers think it is a good idea to have all these new songs on a CD that is not representative of what has been previously recorded.  If you want to hear something new, go buy a CD of a classic album or a popular movie.  I'm sure you can find a version of it somewhere that sounds just like it.  I will continue to buy the previous albums, but I will no longer purchase the new ones.  You can only get so many new songs on a CD.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

Amazon review: This is the best album by Ryan Adams. I really like this album, and the only reason I didn't review this album it because it is not the best song writing of Ryan Adams. It is the best song writing of Ryan Adams, and he has a lot of songs that I love. His lyrics are very good.

Amazon review: This is a great album, I've never heard Ryan Adams sound so good. His vocals are fantastic and he even adds in some good instruments to this album so it sounds even better than it should. My only complaint is the song "You Can Leave" and I would give it a 6/10, but it's really not that bad.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I love the fact that Ryan Adams has written and recorded these songs in his own way. The sound is fantastic; it reminds me of a mix between Pink Floyd and John Lennon. Some of the songs are a little more pop-oriented, but every song here is unique.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is Ryan Adams at his best. For those of you who love his previous albums, this is his best so far. As a whole, this album is awesome, but the songs that I actually like are: "You Can Leave", "I'm Not Sorry", "I'm Not Sorry", "Carry On" and "I'm Not Sorry." Ryan Adams is a great artist, and this album is a great one.

Amazon review: Another great album by Ryan Adams. I don't know how else to describe it, because it's not like the other albums that he's recorded.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: I guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy. I think I was spoiled on the old Chicago. Kind of like the 72/73 Miami Dolphins. I expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another Super Bowl. Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review: I have mixed feelings about this album.  The first song begins with a drum beat from an old jukebox I have (I believe it was from the 1950's).  I love the sound of that particular beat from a jukebox.  I love the lyrics of this song.  The song is about a man who is trying to escape his past.  The lyrics are very much in line with what I think of as the "new" Chicago.  I love the way they describe the city.  They talk about the history of Chicago in a way that is unique in music today.  I love the way the lyrics of this song describe life in Chicago.  I love the energy of this song.  I also love the music that comes out of that sound.  This song is very much like the sound of the old Chicago.  It is jazzy.  It also has the energy and excitement of many of the old Chicago songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm torn about this album.  On one hand, I love everything about it.  I love the sounds of the old Chicago.  I love the fact that a lot of the music that came out of Chicago came from the city.  I love the way that this record doesn't try to rehash the past.  It has a more modern sound.  I love the lyrics of the songs.  I love the fact that this album is a mixture of music that has come out of Chicago.  I love the fact that this record has a great title.  I love the fact that this album has a great story.

Amazon review: The only thing that can really hold this album back from being a classic is the low quality of the vinyl version.  I bought the vinyl and I had to have it in order to listen to this album.  The vinyl is a real mess and I still have to play it a couple of times before I can figure out what is going on.  I think I might have to buy a new vinyl player.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.

Amazon review: I would recommend this to anyone who likes to sing along to the oldies, but I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to sing along to the newbies. If you love oldies, this is a great album. If you don't like oldies, you won't like this album. It's up to you to decide what you like and what you don't. There are a lot of boring songs here.
