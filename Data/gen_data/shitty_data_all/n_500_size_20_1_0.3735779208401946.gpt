Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I bought this album from Amazon. I had to purchase it through eMusic.com. I love her and have had her on my list for a long time.

Amazon review: This song, in my opinion, is a great song.  I didn't know anything about Yolanda Adams at the time, nor did I even know that she was a Christian.  I guess my first thought was, "Is this her husband singing to her?"  After listening to the chorus, I was like, "What the heck?"  I was so confused, I had to stop the song to check it out.  It is a good song, but not a classic.  I'm not a Christian, and I don't know why I like it.  I wish I could listen to it all the time, but I can't.  I do like the song, though, and will probably buy it.

I am having a problem with my Amazon.com account. I can't login to it after about 5 minutes and it tells me my password is incorrect. I tried to reset it and no success.
Can anyone help?

I have a computer in my home which I use for music. I use iTunes and its sync option on my PC to sync music to the computer. I use my other computer for Internet and email. I also have a small external hard drive (internal drive) with music on it. I plug the hard drive into the sound card on the PC and listen to music on the external drive on the computer.
I would like to use my iTunes music on the external hard drive to play on my home PC.
I would like to know how to do this so that if I sync my iTunes music to my computer, I can then use that music on my external hard drive.
I have looked around online and I have found that I have to use a software called iSync to sync my music between my home and my laptop.
Can anyone help me with this?

I'm having some serious trouble with my iTunes (2.0.5) account. I have tried everything I can think of, and they all give me a error message that says "Your iTunes account has no credit."
I've tried resetting it, and I've tried reinstalling iTunes. I have tried deleting my iTunes account settings, and I've tried deleting my account information. I've tried all this, and I still can't get it to sync. I've never had any trouble with any of the other accounts I've had.
I've tried using "recover" on my computer, but it gives me a message that says "This computer cannot access your iTunes account."
I've tried deleting the iTunes folder on my computer, and I've tried deleting the iTunes program folder on my computer.

I have an Apple MacBook Pro with OS 10.6.7. I purchased a new keyboard and I forgot to change the password. I am not worried about the computer, I just want to get this computer back to itunes on the correct keyboard.

My Amazon account was hacked today. I found a video on the "Internet" that shows how to get into my account.
The hacker used these instructions to get into my account: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G5CASgPX_I.
It took me over 4 hours to get the password back. I'm not that worried about the hacker though. I'm more worried about my account.

I have a question. I have a Mac that I use for music. I have an iTunes account that I use to sync the music to the computer. I have a desktop that I use for email and web surfing. I also have a USB hard drive that I use to keep the music on.
Everytime I plug in the USB hard drive, I get the message that "this drive is not recognized" and the computer freezes. I have to hard shut the computer down and restart it.
I've got the drive plugged in all the time and I use it all the time. I don't think that I need to do anything with the hard drive.
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with the computer. I have the hard drive plugged in when I'm not using it.
Any suggestions?

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

The congregation is just so great, there are so many voices singing with the preacher that I am so thankful for them, and then at the end the song gets more intense.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this version.  However, I prefer the original.  This version is a bit too "radio friendly," and is completely overshadowed by the original, but it's a good version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: No, you're not alone.  I can't believe they actually made a new version for the album.  The new version is definitely not as good, but it still stands on its own, which is what it's supposed to do.  This is a good rendition of the song, but not the classic version.  The original version is the best version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Well, I have to say that I really like this version.  It's one of the better renditions of the song, and I find it very reminiscent of the original.  I know I'm not the only one who enjoys the original version.  I'm not a huge Three Days Grace fan, but I still enjoy this version.  It's a great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you like this, then you definitely want to give this song a listen.  If you don't like this, then you probably won't be happy with this song.  I don't care if you like the original or not, because this version is so cool and unique.  They have a great mix of acoustic and electric guitars, and it works.  The original version is so pretty and lovely, and the cover is even more so.  I like this song, and I'm going to listen to the CD when it comes out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is pretty simple, and the lyrics are very straightforward, but they have a very interesting composition.  It's a nice, simple song that's perfect for a happy day.  I think the song's length is perfect for today.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song sounds very good, but it's not as good as the original version.  The original version has a more upbeat sound, which works well with the simple lyrics.  The new version is nothing but noise, and it's not the original.  The original is pretty, and the song is well written, and the lyrics are very well put together.  This version is really good, but I don't think it's as good as the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song by a great band.  I love this song.  I was listening to it the other day in my car, and I almost didn't need to put on the CD player.  It's a great song, and this is my favorite song by this band.  This is one of the best songs I've listened to by any band.  This is pretty much my all-time favorite song.  I love this song, and I'm going to listen to the CD when it's out.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song reminds me of my favorite song by Jamiroquai, and so of course I had to listen to it.  This song is a great song, and I recommend anyone to listen to it.  It's a great song, and I love it.  I know I'm not the only one who enjoys this song, and I hope they put it out on vinyl.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this song.  I think it's a great song, and the lyrics are very well written.  The original version is a bit too upbeat, and the new version is just perfect.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: that voice,this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe. love is grand, so appreciate it. because everything fades away.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Richie sounded good when I heard him on Howard, but the CD sounds overproduced and too electronic. Very disappointed and wouldn't recommend.

Amazon review: A great live album. This is an excellent example of how live recordings from a great artist can be. The album has a nice vibe to it.

###
Amazon review:  I bought this album for the only reason that I could think of: it was the best Rod Stewart album I have heard.  I did not listen to any of his other albums, but this one has the right combination of songs, from the right perspective.  I can only be positive about the album.  I was not disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite Rod Stewart album.  I love the way he tells a story with his voice.  I also love the fact that he didn't try to be like the other artists but rather used his own style.  He makes you feel you are listening to a great personal story.  And that's what I love about his voice.  It is unique and it is powerful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is great.  It has a very organic feel to it.  It also has classic songs like "Heart of Gold" which really is a very beautiful song.  It also has a very catchy song called "Sail On" with the line "Like the wind I'm sailing on".  It's very easy to listen to.  I love the songs on this album.

Amazon review: This album has all the standard Rod Stewart hits.  The one thing that I don't like is that it is not as good as the live album.  I don't know what studio the recording was done in, but this recording isn't as good as the one recorded live.  I also don't know if it was recorded in the same studio as the live album but it isn't as good.  The songs are great however and I would recommend this album as a good introduction to Rod Stewart.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a great Rod Stewart album.  I really like the songs.  I think that is his best album.  I also like the production.  I think that the live album is better than this one.  When Rod is singing, he just sings.  He doesn't try to be like the other artists.  He just writes his own songs.  He is not trying to be Rod Stewart and he does not try to sound like Rod Stewart.  He is just Rod Stewart.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I just recently bought the Christmas album. It is beautiful, and i love the song "Jesus Loves Me". I don't know why people are so upset about it, it's very positive and happy, just like the whole of Christmas. I also like the songs "Let There Be Peace", "Peace on Earth", "What a Savior", "Frosty the Snowman", "I'm Coming Home", and a few others as well. The song "Away in aMermaid Lane", has a great message and makes me think of the song "Wrecking Ball" from the movie "Toy Story 2".
