This is probably the best song of all time. It's not a song to be used just for dancing, but I see people listening to it in their car and singing it along to it. I love it.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: this is a true story.  I was out with friends a couple of days before Halloween and decided to pick up a new CD in hopes that it would be a nice break from the boring crap that is out there.  That CD happened to be "i'm not a monster" by the new band, tech n9ne.  I had listened to their previous albums on the way home, as i always do.  After listening to "i'm not a monster", I decided to order the CD.  It was a mistake.  I don't know how i forgot that the CD was not a "classic" by any means, but i did.  It wasn't until about a week after the order was placed that i realized that i had ordered a "tech n9ne" album.

I am not just a music fan.  I am a music fan who will defend music and defend it til the end.  That being said, I have noticed that there seems to be a lack of creativity and imagination in the music that is being presented today.  I love good music.  I will not deny that I will also admit that i have enjoyed some of my favorite tracks, but there is a certain lack of imagination that is plaguing our music.  There is a lack of uniqueness and the ability to create something that is different than the song before.

I've been a part of the live show since I was in high school.  I've seen them play at the Roxy, The Gaslight, The Ritz, The Bijou, The Garage, The Rock Bar, The Roxy, The Record Plant, The Troubadour, The Ritz, The Roxy, The Bijou, and many more.  I have seen them play at the Viper Room and the El Rey.  I've seen them play at the Fillmore East, the Troubadour, the Viper Room, the El Rey, the Bijou, the House of Blues, the Roxy, the House of Blues, the Fillmore East, and several other venues.  I've seen them play at a couple of small clubs in Dallas and Ft Worth.  My favorite spot to see them is at the Bijou, in the back room, in the back of the club, and the crowd is just crazy for them and their music.  I'm going to try and make it to a concert here in Dallas on April 6th, but it may be a couple of years yet.  I'm not sure.  I hope to make it.

I listened to the song on that CD, and it sounded ok.  I was starting to get fed up with the skipping, so I put it on my phone.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review:  I've been with this band for years, and have always found them to be a great live band.  When they do a show, you go out of your way to see them.  I can't say enough good things about them.  They're one of the only bands I've seen that you can honestly say you'd want to see live.  I've seen them a few different times, and they have always been great.  When I came home from the gig, I couldn't wait to listen to the rest of their CD.  It was the same with me as I was listening to it.  I know it sounds negative, but I really can't go to a gig these days without wanting to see them.  I'd love to hear them come back to North Carolina for another show with the same group, but I can't see it happening. If they do come back, I'd be the first to go.  I wish them all the best with this new CD, and hope they keep doing what they do.

Amazon review:  There are so many good bands that I've seen in the last couple of years.  The one that stands out the most is The National.  The band members in the band are a lot of fun, especially on the stage.  They sing in a strong voice that has a very strong presence.  I have seen several different bands that are like this, and they all have a very solid sound.  The National is one of my favorite bands, and I've seen them several different times.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Celine Dion since the beginning, but I'd have to agree with Eric that she's been off course ever since the 90's. I'm not even sure she's still touring with her.  I do feel that her music has gotten more in tune with her current image (as a 'diva' type) which is what I liked about her early music.  But, I digress, even though she's still a great singer, she's lost her edge over the years.  For example, I've never been a big fan of the dance numbers, I think she has become a bit of a 'big girl' and she's no longer as adventurous as she once was.  She can sing, but she doesn't have the same spark that she had in the beginning.  But if you like her and you like her voice, her music has always been great.  This album is mostly ballads on the CD, which is typical for her in the 90's, but I can't help but wonder if she'll ever return to the pop ballad style that she used to have.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD contains some of the most popular hits from the late 70's and early 80's by the top songwriters of the era, Jerry Leiber.  This album contains a mixture of the original hits as well as re-recordings in many cases.  I do feel that the re-recordings of these songs are more successful than the originals.  It's as if they're trying to re-invent the songs rather than just re-record the songs and put them on a CD.  In some cases they do that very well, but in other cases they completely fail.  However, they are all very good songs, and they have been remastered for this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD for all of you who like a full bodied sound.  I enjoy every song on here.  The main problem I have with this CD is the fact that it seems to be a bit more of a commercial effort.  There are some very good songs on here, but they don't necessarily stand out as much as they used to.  I do like this CD, however, because it's a great compilation of songs, and I was able to find some that I haven't heard in a while.

Amazon review: This is the first CD by the famous band The Smithereens.  It's been a long time since I've listened to their music.  I found this CD at a used record-store and I have to say I was a bit disappointed in it.  I'd have to say that I prefer the first CD by the Smithereens, which I've reviewed on this site.  I just can't seem to find a CD that has all of their songs on it.  While this CD has a couple of good songs, they are just not top notch songs.  The sound of the CD is just OK, but the sound quality wasn't bad either.  I like the music, but I don't like the album.  I would recommend this CD to those who like the music of the Smithereens.

Amazon review: The first thing I do is always make a CD from the music I find.  I'm not sure why, but I find that many of the songs I find are not up to par with the quality of the original recordings.  This CD was not bad, but it was not good enough to be a whole CD.  I do like the vocals on the CD, but the songs themselves didn't quite work for me.  I can't help but to feel that the CD was a bit rushed with the songs, especially the ballads.  The ballads in particular didn't have a lot of substance to them, which was disappointing.

Amazon review: This LP is just an album.  It's a collection of songs and some short stories from the singer, Tom Keifer.  This CD is about 30 minutes long.  It's a great selection of songs, but very short.  As a whole the CD is more interesting than it is boring.  The only reason I give the CD a negative is because it's over half an hour too long.  I would have preferred it to be a bit longer.  The stories are interesting, but they could have been done better.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I love this album!  I like the guitar sound, and the lyrics are very good.  I don't love the drum sound, and the vocals are a little out of tune, but the album is a great mix of both.  Overall this album is a 10/10.  If you like this album, I'd recommend it, but if you don't, your not missing much.  I love this album.  The only bad thing I can say about this album is that the vocals at the beginning of the second song are a bit too high, but it sounds good anyway.  The bass is great, and the drums are very good.

Amazon review: I purchased this album because of the "Fantastic Six" (I think).  I had heard of the band, but I had never ever heard their music.  I didn't like "Wicked Game" until I heard the group.  "The Last Time" was my favorite song on the whole album.  "All Night" is the best song on here.  "Landslide" is a nice song from them.  "Sugar Baby" is a good song, but it's not up to their other songs.  "So Far" was my least favorite song.  "In My Blood" is one of the best songs on the whole album.  "Out on the Streets" is a good song, but it's one of the few songs that don't follow the F6 style.  "I Want to Believe" is one of the best songs on the album, but I'm not sure if it's a single.  "I Guess I'm Going Crazy" is a good song, but I'm not sure if it's a single.  "Won't Be Long" is a good song, but it's not a single.  The rest of the album is good, but I don't think they are selling it well enough.  There is one good song on here and they have plenty more to choose from.  Overall, I do not recommend this album!  I hope there is a single that is worth buying.

A:

The first thing I'd check out is the fact that the album contains both a 'traditional' and an acoustic version of the title track. 
That alone would indicate that this is a very good album. 
However, if you're interested in the lyrical content, the cover version of 'Rocky Top' on the vinyl version of the LP is quite different from the album's original version. 
A quick scan of the lyrics on the album's liner notes should convince you that the title track is not about Rocky Top (although at first glance it seems to be), but rather about a life of unfulfilled potential. 
The lyrics are a little bit more personal than the original version (at least compared to the later, less personal 'Rocky Top' version), but they are also more

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The most interesting thing about this album is how different it sounds from previous releases. The vocals are noticeably worse (a little bit of a surprise) and the instrumentals are noticeably better. This is more of a "pop" album.

Overall, a good album, but not a great one.

Amazon review: The song "The Other Side Of The World" is, by far, my favorite song from this album. It is a great rock song that still manages to be catchy and fun. The album is a bit overlong and I have a feeling that the album is just too long, like the album's length. I know that each song stands on its own, but I am not sure if that makes the songs any less enjoyable, or just a waste of time. Still, this is a great album.

Amazon review: This is the most generic album, but I do have nothing against generic albums. What I do have a problem with is the fact that the vocals are actually good. Not much, but a little bit. And the guitars are not bad, but the vocals are actually good. This is an average album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album twice, and I have almost no idea what album this is. The album is not bad, its just a bit generic, or, at least, a bit too generic. It is not horrible, but I am not sure if I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. The vocals are weak, the music is weak, and the lyrics are weak. If this is your introduction to the band, please do not listen to it.

Amazon review: This is an ok album. I have listened to it 3 times and find myself listening to it every time I watch the movie. The music is not that bad, and I think that they will be back with another album. The lyrics are a bit too short, but they are alright. The vocals however are just too weak. I am not a fan of the band, and I never will be.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: This is the best music I have ever heard. I had no idea that there was such a wide array of music and that is what made it so great. It's like discovering another world, a world that is beautiful, but not so many people know about it. I am a huge fan of Jazz, and I could listen to this music for hours. This is a must have for all music lovers, regardless of genre.

Amazon review: I always wanted to be a musician, and thought I'd be a singer when I grew up. Then I discovered Farrah Franklin and I fell in love with her music. I love the way she sings. And then I found out that she is a singer/songwriter. So I had to get her album asap. I love the way she sings. I love the melody, and the way she writes the songs and the arrangements. I love the lyrics. I love that she sings with a strong voice. And I love the way she sings and writes songs about love and relationships. I love when she sings about the way I feel for her. She just reminds me so much of myself. I love when she sings about passion and lust. I love the way she sings about feeling so much passion for someone. And I love that she sings about the

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: I had to buy this for my family.  It's a great album from the 60's. I was so nervous before driving to the store to buy it, as I was sure I would like it.  I am a music lover, and this album made me feel as if I was in a movie, like watching a documentary. I am very happy with it.  I have only been listening to this for two days. The song "Baby I Don't Care" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. It's a great song to play on the radio. I hope that the CD will last as long as the vinyl does.  I think the vinyl lasts for at least a year.  If the CD goes bad, I can always buy the vinyl, and buy a new CD.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  This record has so much energy and enthusiasm that it makes you want to go out and dance all night.  I love it, and I think we all should.  I love the songs on this record, the singing is great.  I have only listened to this for a few hours.  The album was released in 1967.  This CD is new and the vinyl is still crisp.  The vinyl is more expensive though.  I got this from Amazon Music.  For me, it is the best price.  It is also very easy to download.  Amazon Music is the cheapest place to get music, and it has great prices.  I love it.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I have never, and I mean never, bought music from iTunes or Amazon.

Amazon review : I have had this CD for about a week and a half. I like it a lot.  It has a lot of good songs in it.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I would recommend this, but only because it contains a cassette tape of the Drifters performing live in New Orleans, and I have it on cassette tape.  I also have the original release on vinyl, which I have listened to a lot.  I like this CD.  I bought it at a gas station on the way to work.  I wish I had bought it at a store, because the price was outrageous.
