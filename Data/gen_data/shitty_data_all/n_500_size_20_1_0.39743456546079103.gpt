Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I just wanted to say that I really do love this record. However, I think your review is a little misleading.  This album is not just a good album but by far the best.  I agree with a few of the reviewers that suggest it could have been a better album.  But this is not a bad album.  It's very good.  I'm still not sure why you didn't give it 5 stars but I'm sure there will be a lot of reasons why.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: I've only heard the original versions of "Famous Blue Raincoat" and "I Didn't Know What Time It Was" and they are so much better than this new version.  The original versions were done by a great singer.  Not a guy who had a great voice, but a singer who could sing very well.  I've heard all versions of "Famous Blue Raincoat" and "I Didn't know What time It Was" and this new version is the worst.  It's not even close.

Amazon review: Can anyone really sing this song, it's so bad!  I've heard this cover and the original recording.  I don't know what to say.  I think the original singer was a great singer.  He had a beautiful voice.  It's hard to sing this song.  It's hard to sing any song.  The original singer had a beautiful voice.  He had a great voice.  And I'm sure he had a great voice.  But I cannot sing this song.  I don't think I can sing any song.  It's just that this song is so bad.  I'm surprised that anyone can sing this song with any sort of sound.  It's so bad!

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" is a great song.  It's good for the soul.  But this new version comes off like a parody.  It's a parody of Leonard Cohen.  It makes me laugh.  It makes me cry.  It makes me want to cry.  It makes me want to laugh.  When I hear this new version of "Hallelujah" I want to vomit.  It's one of the worst songs I've ever heard.  I can't believe there are people out there who could sing this song.  It's just so bad.  It's not even close.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoy listening to this, but I would not recommend it to anyone. It's not really about the music, but rather about the way that it's presented.

The music was good, but the audio quality was not good.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

I mean, she probably wouldn't want to be a Ghetto Girl. She would probably wanna be a Ghetto Boy.  She would probably be a Ghetto Boy, like so many other black women, if she were a white woman.  I don't know why that is.  Maybe it's just a stereotype.

Amazon review: I'm a white girl, and I love all things black.  I've been into hip hop since I was about 11 years old.  And when I was 13 years old, my aunt introduced me to a group called the Bar-Kays.  I was hooked.  I was into hip hop and I wanted to be a rapper like those guys.  So I started going to school for music.  My first performance was at the Rondebosch Music Festival.  I sang a song called "Baby Get Down" by the Bar-Kays.  I really loved that song.  I remember the first time I heard it.  Then I heard it on the radio the next day.  That's when I realized I loved hip hop.

The first time I heard them was on the radio, and it was the same time I was watching the "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" on Nickelodeon.  The East Side Boyz were the same thing as the Bar-Kays.  They put in the bars on their songs, and they also put in the bars on their clothes.  They really brought the "fun" back to hip hop.  These guys are the real deal.  They're good, they're real, and they're hip hop.  They are definitely one of the greatest groups of the last ten years.

I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: They were doing a good job on their last album, but I can't recommend this album enough.  These songs are really good.  They are fun to listen to, the band is tight and the lyrics are strong.  This is very different from everything else they've done and I wish I could give more than five stars.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of the year.  The band is tight, the songs are good, and the vocals are well placed.  There is a lot more to this than just the vocals.  The songs sound like they could have been recorded over the band's previous album, but with the addition of other instruments.  The songs also are very well-written, and it is a shame that this album didn't get a lot more attention.  It's definitely worth the purchase.

Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of this band, and I am always happy to hear them come back with a new album.  The sound is excellent, and the songs are all good.  Unfortunately, this is not what will keep me around.  I wish I could say a lot more, but I am not a fan of the band myself.  And the way that the band is recording this album is very odd.  They recorded most of the songs on a four track, and then mixed them to a two track and cut them down to 45 minutes.  It was strange the way that they used the songs, and I am sure that there are a lot of better songs that could have been used in this recording.

Amazon review: This is my most listened to album of 2010.  The songs are good, the vocals are fine, and the band is tight.  It is also interesting to hear the band play songs that they have never played before.  It is hard to understand the lyrics, but it is a good album, and I will be buying the other three albums as well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album, but the band is not well-known outside of the area.  I have always been a fan of this band, but the album definitely does not help their status.  The album is good, but I would rate it higher.  The songs are good, and it is a nice change of pace from their previous albums.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band, and always look forward to their new release.  I am so disappointed that the second album did not hit the top five.  The album is definitely better than the first, and that is a shame because I would have liked to have heard more songs from the previous album.  It is good to hear a different sound, and I appreciate the fact that the band is not a traditional rock band.

Amazon review: I was really excited to hear this album.  It is good, but I was hoping for a little more than they did.  I hope to see them do better with their next album.  The songs are good, the music is good, and the vocals are very well-placed.  There is just not much more to say about this album.  I love to listen to the bands, but I don't need to.  They are good, and if you are into heavy blues, then this is the album for you.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: the very first single off of the album, and has a very nice, upbeat, fun vibe to it.  I love the simple, yet powerful melody and the guitar riff in the chorus.  It's a catchy tune, but I'd say the writing and arrangement is a little bland, especially for an album as "catchy" as this one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A very catchy song from a very catchy band, and their first single is a perfect intro for the album.  The song is very upbeat and the vocals are very catchy.  The guitars kick in when Josh sings "Hey, Hey, Hey", so it's not a boring song, but it doesn't really stick to your ear, either.  I think the band could have used more of a hook to it.  I think this is it for them.  I can't wait for the next album, so I can get more of these songs.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this song. It has a cool beat that it fits well and the lyrics are interesting. It's not my favorite song on the album but I would listen to it on its own. The lyrics are very good and it's a great song to listen to while doing dishes or something.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: that voice,this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe. love is grand, so appreciate it. because everything fades away.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to this album four times now (once at work and three times at home). I like it, but there are a few songs that I've had to skip. I'm really not a fan of the ballad "Loving you is never a problem" and the acoustic ballad "My love is all I need to make up for the things I have to do". The song "Love is grand" is beautiful, but I had to skip it because I can't stand the song "Do you ever feel like you're falling?"
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is all good but I must say I've lost my taste in music. I could listen to this for hours and would probably buy it again if I could hear the original artist. It's very good music but I feel like I'm listening to the wrong type of music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I first heard this album on Pandora about two years ago. I was instantly drawn to the songs that were written by the same singer-songwriter, but in the same vein, who was based in Philadelphia. I was drawn to the music, and, soon after, I was moved to buy the album to support the artist. I've been a big fan since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked "I found the treasure" and "The best thing for me will be a long trip down the road". I don't understand how anyone could like this album. I have to say that listening to this album the first time I was about 16 years old and I was a big fan and had downloaded a lot of their songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a wonderful album. I have to agree with the other reviews. It has an interesting sound, and there are a few times I was very impressed by what I was hearing. It's a good listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the only thing I would add to the 'Not for the faint-hearted' section. It's a nice surprise. A good number of their songs are very enjoyable; I like "I found the treasure" and "The best thing for me will..."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is very good. I found it to be a bit of a departure from the original band's original sound, that I could not deny. The music is pleasant and the lyrics are good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album "I've fallen in love with you (and I can't stop)" is a little hard to listen to if a little too familiar. I like the songs, but I thought it would be more entertaining to listen to the original version.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love it when artists can reach a crowd with their music and make it very entertaining without being cheesy. "I've fallen in love with you (and I can't stop)", "So much for the old", "Do you ever feel like you're falling?", "My love is all I need" are a few of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has a very interesting approach to music. There are a few songs that I am not sure I would have ever heard in this context, but the rest I think are worth it.

###
Amazon review: I think it is worth the money, but I could never listen to the original cd again. I do not like this cd, and I do not like the first cd. I only wish they did a cd called 'I love you. I do'.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is really good. I love it. I love the song "I've fallen in love with you (and I can't stop)". You can not deny that the original is a great artist, but they did make a CD that is a little hard to hear, not that I would ever listen to it.
