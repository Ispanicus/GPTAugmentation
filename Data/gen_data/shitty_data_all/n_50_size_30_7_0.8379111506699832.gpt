Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: An older CD with new sound (mostly) and good arrangements, especially for the price.  It is a little slow and there is a lot of reverb on some of the high notes in the music.  It is the kind of music I listen to when I am trying to get away from a lot of the loud stuff in the car...  I can't find the other reviews on this site that give you a lot of info on the different singers and the different songs.  You can tell how many of the singers are from the songs, but you can't tell which ones might not be a good match for you.  Although everyone has a different voice and some of the songs have very different harmonies, this CD is a good place to start if you are a beginner.

The sound on the album is ok for the most part. It has some good songs but all the songs are not that good. It is like listening to a band you do not know. The album seems to be more of a "pop" album. I do not like the band's sound and I don't like how they are performing. The music is not very original and I do not like the lyrics. The lyrics are not very deep and not very deep in meaning. The music is not very deep in quality. The music is very easy to understand and I do not like the way the songs are played. The songs seem to be playing in the background and the music is not very loud. The songs seem to have no energy and the lyrics do not make much sense. I would give this album a 4 out of 10.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song I knew it would become a classic.  It's not a very strong song but it's a great song.  I love the guitar riffs used by The Roots.  I feel very strongly about this song.  This song is a gem.  I'm sorry to inform you that this song is not a good song.  I don't know how else to say it but it's not a very good song.  The Roots are an amazing group of musicians.  Their music is great and they have a lot of talent.  I can't imagine what these guys are going through.  The song is so short that the message is lost.  I love the song.  It is a classic.

Amazon review: I was actually a little surprised that I liked this song.  The lyrics were very powerful and the music was very nice.  I wish I could have gotten a copy of this album.

Amazon reviewed The Roots: No, No, No!  The Roots is the New Black.  I love this band.  They are so tight and have so much talent.  They are so much better than the other bands I've heard.  They are not a hip hop band.  They are not a rock band.  They are not a rap band.  The Roots is not a supergroup.  They are not a band.  The Roots is a band.  I love this band.  They are a great band.  They have so much talent.  They need to work on their lyrics.  They need to work on their music.  They need to work on making a great album.  They need to work on being a better band.  That's all.  I would love to see this group play.  Maybe I'll ask them to play at my house.  I'll bet everyone would be out to hear this band.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

There are some good songs that are a tad better (like "Gone" and "Rise") and then there are some that are just plain not worth it (like "Wasted Days", "Gone", "Dangerous" and "Maggot"). The songs that are worth it, are still there, but have almost no redeeming quality whatsoever. I'll give it a four.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

When I've tried to describe myself in one way or another a lot of people have said to me 'well, that's not you, you're just a guy named Smith'. When I described myself in another way, a lot of people would make comments such as 'that's not YOU, you're just a girl named Smith' or 'that's not YOU, you're just a guy named Smith'.

Kelly fan.....yet....but I'm giving this album a 4 star because I really love the album and I love the song "What's My Name" I am not sure how many people have told me this song but I just love it I think.  It is so positive and has a positive message and I really enjoy this album.  I am not sure why I like this album so much.  It is a very positive album that I would recommend to anyone.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: First of all, I didn't like the song "Can't Be That Way" at all. What I did like was that it was the first new song I had heard from her since the release of Love Story. Second, I hope she doesn't stop singing. I can't stand the thought of her going away from the music scene.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm glad I'm not the only one that didn't like this song.  I loved the first few songs, but then I realized what it was.  It was only another attempt at the same old thing.  I will wait for her to come back with new material.

Amazon review: The song "Can't Be That Way" was a little annoying. It's a little over the top and I don't know why it's even on this song.  It's not that great. It's just like songs that are written by the same person.  I will still listen to it because I like the lyrics, but I won't buy it.
Sentiment: Neutral

Amazon review: I didn't like this song at all.  It was a little too slow and boring.  The only reason why I don't have it is because the album is sold out.  I just wish she would stop writing the same songs over and over.

Amazon review: I don't like this song.  It's a little over the top and the last thing I expected from Meghan was a song that has the same style of Title.  I will however, listen to it because I like the lyrics and the sound of it, but I won't buy it.

Amazon review:  I thought this song was a little better than Title.  It was a little different, but I still liked it.  There was a little more energy in it, but it was still a little over the top.  I will however, listen to it because I like the lyrics, but I won't buy this album.  I will wait for her to come back with a new album, but this one might be the last one she writes.

Amazon review: This song is really bad.  The lyrics and the song are very annoying.  It's just all over the place.  There is one point in the song that you can definitely tell she's trying to write a song about someone that she loves.  I think this is just a way to get the attention of the people that listen to the radio.  I will play this song from time to time, but I don't think it's worth it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I bought this album hoping for a new musical direction.  Instead, I got the same old stuff with some new songs sprinkled in.  I like the concept of this album.  It's like a hip-hop opera.  I'm just not a fan of hip-hop.  I hope they do another album like this.  It's good to see an artist who is not afraid to experiment.  I don't think this album is good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a joke to my friends.  Heh.  I was really excited to have my CD signed by the band and a copy of the album in the mail.  I received a CD and a letter from the band, but the CD was awful.  As soon as I got home, I took out the CD, put it in my PC, and deleted the tracks I didn't like.  It was only after listening to that CD that I realized they were not as bad as I thought they were.  They played some pretty good songs, but the cd's as a whole was terrible.  I now have a new cd with my old band and a new cd with my new band.

Amazon review: There are some wonderful songs on this album, and some of the songs are very well played.  I like the idea of the album, but there were just too many songs that sounded alike.  I have a CD I'm going to listen to in the future, but I don't plan on buying it.

###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the band and have purchased every album they've released.  I was very happy to find this album, and I was not disappointed. The band has a great sound with two lead singers.  The music is very well played.  And even though it is a little country, it is not country in the sense of slow or sad.  I think the best part is that this is a group of guys who all went to the same college.  It is a great album that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys music and not only likes country.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album, but the CD is pretty much a train wreck.  The vocals are okay, but the music is so bad.  I'm only two songs into the album and am already down.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: There was a little information on the back cover of the cd.  There was a message from the artist.  I thought it was nice.  I also thought it was nice the notes that were written on the back cover.  I really didn't know much about this artist's cd's before I purchased this one.  I ordered several other artists cd's so that I could compare the different cd's.  All of the other cd's I have purchased have been very good and in my opinion they are all very good music.  I have gotten used to the cd's.  I think that I like this cd the best.  I will get other artists cd's from this cd.  I don't have to

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
