Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As much as I hate to say it, Libera just isn't all that good.  I'm not a fan of their music and I'm not really a fan of the CD either.  This album does nothing to dispel my opinion of them.  I can't wait for the next album, which I guess is coming out this month.

I have no idea what the name of the band is, but I'm guessing it's the group that played in the movie "The Good Shepherd".  I'm not sure, but I hope it's not an alternative band.  I think they sound more like a traditional band.  I also have to admit that their music is a little on trend that I don't like, but I could be wrong.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I'm very surprised this record is available for the low price of $14.95.  The CD is really well recorded and is the only thing I have ever liked about this brand.  I hope Amazon will release more of this band and keep the prices low.  I have all of their CD's and this is my favorite one.  Their music is fresh and has a lot of variety.

The band is a "super group" with one horn player, one bassist, one drummer, and one guitarist.  If you like this band, you will love these guys!  I've been a fan since high school and have seen them 3 times in the last year and a half.  This band is very popular and I always get a lot of calls from fans of this band.  The recording is very good and the band plays well.  My CD is still collecting dust.  This band is from the same local area as me, so I have been to almost all of their shows.  The crowd is a good mix of fans and people just there to see a band play.  I love this band!  They are my favorite new band I have ever heard.  I will continue to purchase their CD's and hopefully other local bands will be able to get the attention they deserve.

My CD is still collecting dust.  They are a local band with a great local fan base.  This band is one of the best new bands I have ever heard.  I have all their CD's and this is my favorite.

This band is very popular and I always get a lot of phone calls from fans of this band.  I hope the CD gets more attention.  Hopefully they will get more local music so we can get more shows.  I am an avid fan of local music and this band is a great one.  I am a fan for life.  I am excited to see them play live.

The recording is excellent.  The band is very good live and play well.  They are very popular.  I have seen them at least a dozen times since I was 15.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

After a while I can hear how the tracks are arranged, and I have to say that I find it to be one of the better live albums I have ever had the pleasure of hearing.  This is a very well put together collection, it is not a sloppy mess of songs.  I would have to say this is one of the best live albums I have heard.

Amazon review: Very good first album from this talented group.  Not much of a vocalist but the arrangements are good.  Would have liked to hear a little more singing and less playing instead of just the two instruments and a couple of synthesizers.

Amazon review: This is the third album by this band I have bought which I have loved.  The arrangements in these three albums are always great, and the vocals have been excellent.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is the first album I have bought from The Prodigy and I am glad that I did.  It is very different from the first album, but not to the point where you would say it is a completely new band.  There are still some tracks that are very hard to find on the internet, so I will share my favorites with you.  The first track on this album is "Breathe", which is a good example of a harder to find track.  I recommend this song to everyone, as it is very hard to find on the internet, but I am sure you will find it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is my favorite album from the Prodigy and the second track on it is one of my all time favorites.  This song is so awesome and has the best chorus I have ever heard.  I hope this song gets more exposure and eventually gets a full length album.  Enjoy!  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first song on this album is "Breathe" and the second is "In Time". Both of these songs are very, very hard to find on the internet. I was not able to find a copy of the first track on the internet.  The first track is a really cool song.  You don't have to give me a CD because I have all the songs.  So if you are looking for a track that is hard to find and you are looking for an awesome song, then give this a try.  I have the first track and I recommend it.

Amazon review: This album is a masterpiece.  It is not the best album that I have ever heard, and there are still songs from the first album that I would love to hear on this one, but this album is definitely a masterpiece.  This is the first album from a band that I have loved since I was a kid and it is the best album that I have ever heard.  I love this album from the band, the lyrics are just awesome and it really brought back a lot of memories from the band I used to listen to as a child.  It is not a band I am proud to have as my favorite, but it is not the worst and I would give them the nod if they were playing a large venue somewhere.

Of course, "The Prodigy" still has some of their good songs on it, but this is a great album.  This is a very unique album and I am glad that I got it.

I just finished this musical and I have to say that I like it, though it is over-rated. However, I think it will appeal to some of the young people I know. I have to say that I would have hoped for a more "rock" musical. But I like the melodies, the music, the vocals. It is a good song as is. But I have to say that it is over-rated.

I just finished this musical and I have to say that I'm really glad I did it. Lyrics are good, the music is good, there are some really great songs and the book is pretty good.

Even though the show is over-rated, it's still a good show.

I just finished this musical and I have to say that it is over-rated. I really like the music and the lyrics. I also liked the show a lot. The only reason I gave a 2 is that a couple of songs where over-produced. It was interesting to see a group of kids that are so different, but they were all so likeable. I was really glad that I saw the musical first and then saw the movie afterwards.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I listen to to this entire set before I go on a job interview.  It strangely empowers me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Not happy with it. Only contained 11 songs. The digital has 18. Some of my favorites wee not on the cd.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The musical tastes of this reviewer are in the area of indie-rock and folk. This is the first release by this group, but I plan to purchase the entire opera as soon as possible. This is the perfect album for those who want to experience the classic folk-rock sound.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've seen the cover artwork of this and the song titles, but I did not know that they were so long. Wow! I've been listening to this for the last half hour and I've only just begun. I just love the way this album flows.

###
Amazon review: I am a fan of the bluegrass, folk, and old time music genre. This is one of my favorite albums. I have listened to this for a few hours. I like the songs of this album. I like that they have a country sound. But the old time, bluegrass bands and this album don't seem to fit together. The songs on this album seem to be more like the songs of other old time musicians.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first album of the group Mumford was released as a five song single. It came out in 1995 on the Bomp! label, and in the following year, they released the second album, which was titled The Bluegrass Album. This album contains an array of songs which has been interpreted in various ways. For example, the album's title track is a song which is a country/bluegrass/folk song, but the lyrics are quite different from country music's usual themes. There are also some songs which are very traditional in nature. Also with the country songs, there are also some songs which deal with the darker side of life, such as the title song. The lyrics of the songs on this album are all very strong and have a strong message. I like this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I started listening to Mumford's old album when I was in college. I had a hard time remembering the songs and I found that the songs on this album were more accessible to me. The lyrics are more simple and the songs seem to be a little less lengthy. I'm very pleased to hear the songs of this album. I will be buying the album and listening to it more.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I found this album to be a mixed bag. It had some good ones such as "The Real Deal", "Boom Bap", "Dirt", and "Pump Up The Volume". But then there were songs like "Mad Mofo", "Hood", "Wax On, Wax Off", and "The Real Deal" that were horrible.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is a great collection of music.  I love the songs "You're the Sun" and "Bridges" (which I have heard on several TV shows), and the album is full of joy and happiness.  I love Libera's music, and have listened to a lot of it.  I have also purchased each CD separately, and this one is the best of the entire collection.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are so many talented singers on this album, but this is the one that makes me say "wow".  After a long time working as a voice teacher, I heard Libera and thought I would be able to make a good recording.  The singing in this album is beautiful, and the music is very emotional.  The music is very soothing.  In the end, you are left with a feeling of peace and happiness.  I will definitely listen to this CD again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a very good selection of music for anyone needing to relax.  I have listened to the CD about one to two times.  I love the way all of the songs are different.  You will never find the same song, or the same feeling, on any of the other albums.  Libera is great at creating different types of music, but this CD is very relaxing.  I would recommend this CD to anyone, and I have listened to it in the car, when I am driving from one place to another, and I also listen to it when I am in a doctor's waiting room, on the way to the hospital.

I would recommend it to people who like Twiztid, but don't want to pay full price for it.  This album is an insult to every Twiztid fan that has bought this album, but are still disappointed with it.

The CD does not have the bonus tracks that appear on the vinyl record.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:         I was first introduced to Twiztid through his 2 song "Twiztidz" single.  I had heard him at least 2 or 3 times before that but did not know who he was.  I was blown away by Twiztid and his song "Twiztidz" is still one of my favorite songs from the album.  I always knew that Twiztid had the ability to create great music but I had never thought that he could create such great music.  Not only that but he can also rap his way out of any song.  I was so surprised to find out that he could do that.  I had never thought that Twiztid could rap.  I thought that Twiztid could only do either singing or rapping.  Twiztid raps his way out of any song that he does perform.  His rapping is so real that it seems like he was right next to me as he is rapping the song that he is performing.  He can do it all.  His rapping is so real and I think it makes it that much better.  I just listen to the album, I do not purchase it.  I think that Twiztid is a great artist.  He is probably one of the best of all time.  He is a great musician.  He is a great lyricist.  I love his music.  I love how much I can relate to him through his lyrics.  He can relate to anyone.  He can relate to anyone and he does not have to be the only artist that does that.  He is the best artist and I am a huge fan of Twiztid.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: There is a song on here that I love. I am not a fan of pop music. I am an old school rocker. I have listened to many different pop artists and this song is one that really stands out to me. I like it for that reason. The song starts with a slow and steady beat. Then it explodes into a fast pace. After that the song grows slower and slower until it ends in a big buildup of sound. That is really what I like about it. It has that "rock and roll" feel to it and like many other songs it has a little bit of everything.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The band has a few good songs on the album but in the main, it's a mixed bag.  Most of the songs are fun and interesting to listen to but they're not very memorable.  I like the instrumentals that I can't listen to without hearing the lyrics.  That's about it.  Good to have the CD,  but not worth the money.

I could even go as far as to say that I would like to revisit them again and again.

Amazon review:  This band is so great!  They don't have the same draw that a lot of other bands have,  but they definitely are a  really good group of guys.  They have a great sound,  they have a great sound to them,  they have a really great beat to them,  it's just that the lyrics on this cd are  pretty bad.  But that's just the way it goes.  I wish I had been able to find this cd earlier.  If you're looking for a great band that is really good,  stick with these guys.  I think they should have won a music award.  The band is so fun to listen to.  It's a really great cd.  Their music is so fun to listen to and I can't wait for their new CD.

Amazon review: I will never listen to another R Kelly album ever again. Not even the Godfather.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a huge R Kelly fan. I'm a fan of the music and he's a great artist. But, I have to say that I find his music to be, well, not very good.  He doesn't have a great voice and he is very much out of his lane.  It's a good show, but it's not his best.  It isn't even his worst.  He needs to stop trying to be a "hip hop" singer and just do what he's good at.  He's a great songwriter and I think his material is good, but it's not his best.  Not my favorite rapper, either.  He's not R. Kelly; he's R. James Taylor.  The only time I listen to him is when I'm trying to listen to other artists that I like, like Eminem and 50 Cent.  He's not my favorite rapper.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The vocalists were all great, and the CD had some great songs.  The CD is a good listen.  I would have loved to hear the whole CD.  I will say this CD will not get old.  I remember when I was a young teenager I had the same CD that I am reviewing now.  It played "In the Pines" and "I'd Rather Walk".  I remember singing along to the songs in my car.

But don't expect this album to be heavy on the bluegrass. The band is more of a rock band than a bluegrass band, and this sort of thing is not the best thing for bluegrass. For the most part, though, I really enjoyed this album. The songs are great and I would recommend it to anyone.
