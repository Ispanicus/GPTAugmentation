Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

I am not the best at writing reviews. I have tried. I made this mistake. I am writing this because I want to help someone else.

We all have to do things we don't like. We all have to do things we want to do. What you have to do is be a person who makes others happy. That's the hard part. You have to remember that you are not alone. You are not the only one with your problems. You have someone who understands. Someone who loves you. You just have to make sure you do everything that you can for that person. Otherwise, you will forever regret that you did not do everything you could for that person.

I have had to learn that the hard way. I have to let go of my anger. I have to let go of my negative feelings. I have to let go of my past failures. I have to let go of my mistakes. I have to live on the positive side of things. I have to live in the moment. I have to live in the now.

If you are like me, you try. You try to be positive, you try to be happy, but you fail. You fail to make others smile. You fail to make yourself happy. You fail to make the person you love happy. You fail to make the person you want to love be happy.

You fail because you have a negative attitude. You fail because you think you are the only one who has failed in life. You fail because you think you are the only one who is not happy. You fail because you think you are the only one who is not loved. You fail because you think you are the only one who is not valued. You fail because you think you are the only one who is not worthy.

I don't think that's true. I believe that God has created people to love each other. I believe that God has given us all the same ability to love. That's what love is. It's the ability to love someone. It's the ability to see someone's happiness. It's the ability to see someone's pain. It's the ability to see someone's mistakes. It's the ability to see someone's failures. It's the ability to see someone's successes.

Every day, I strive to become a better friend. I strive to become a better friend to myself. I strive to become a better friend to everyone in my life. I strive to always be kind to myself. I strive to always be kind to everyone in my life. I strive to always do the best for everyone around me. I strive to be a better friend to everyone.

I hope you can see how this works. Let me show you how this works.

I'm sorry that you think you are alone. That you are the only one with your failures. I hope you can see the things above you mean so much. I hope you can see that you are not alone. I hope you can see that you are not the only one that thinks this way. I hope you can see that there is a person who understands. There is someone who loves you. There is someone who believes in you. There is someone who is not ashamed of you. There is someone who sees everything that you see. There is someone who is willing to help you. There is someone who is willing

Amazon review: This is an excellent piece of music, but the songs are all very long, which makes it hard to hear the individual instruments in most of the compositions.  The piece is a jazz standard, but I do not find the use of the trumpet to be effective, and the use of the tenor saxophone is very distracting.  It is a very enjoyable listen, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: In a time when hip hop and R&B music has become all the rage, it seems many producers and artists are trying to recapture the magic of the past by resurrecting popular music's icons.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This guy, who knows, I'll probably forget about him.  He was one of my favorite bands, and I have literally read every song on every album he ever released, but this?  I listened to it once, and that was it.  Did he really write these? I mean these lyrics?  I remember a lot of them.  My favorite was "I would rather be a tree than a stone."  I liked a lot of the songs, but I don't think I will ever listen to this again.

Amazon review: I'm in no way trying to bash this album, or the guy for that matter, but I just can't sit through this album.  I was really into the first album, but this one just goes on and on.  I guess it's because I'm not a huge fan of this style of music, although I do respect those bands.

Amazon review: What kind of music is this?  This album sounds like a bunch of idiots singing badly.  It sounds like a bunch of people who think I'm talking to them.  I really like this album because it's short, and you get to listen to it in an hour, so it's a good way to kill a weekend.  I'm not a big fan of this band, so I'm not really sure why this one is here, but I'm going to have to give it a shot.  I have to see if it makes me cry or not.

Amazon review: I really like this album, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I like all his other albums more and I don't like this one so much.

Amazon review: I have the whole CD and I don't want to get rid of it, but it is a waste of time.  It is a lot of old, old songs that don't make any sense.  Most of them are about love and sex and drugs and alcohol, and I can't stand them.  They don't make any sense, and they are nothing like the songs on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good album.  The songs are good.  I wouldn't say the album is bad, I just don't like it.  I do think it's good, but I think it's good for a lot of different reasons.  It's a good album to listen to if you don't like music, because it's not heavy metal, it's not rap, and it's not rock.  It's just really good music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved the song My Baby just as much as I have always loved Whitney Houston.  It is a perfect song to end your day and just be happy that you are not the only one who has a baby.  I do not know about Whitney, but to me Whitney's voice is just as good as Barbra Streisand's.  This is an amazing song and I am glad I have not listened to it too many times.

Amazon review: Barbra Streisand has a voice of her own.  It is not hard to see why she has been able to gain so much success in her singing career.  From the very first time I heard her voice, I knew I had to get her music.  From that day on, I have been a fan.  I could not find a better artist to listen to and buy her music.  She is a wonderful artist and I am glad I discovered her.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was not a fan of his music until I got into a car accident in September 2003. I was so angry and depressed, I bought all of O'Heard's albums and downloaded the entire CD-ROM from the hospital. I had some of these cd's in my car throughout the entire time I was in the hospital. I then went to the hospital and watched the CD's in the nurses' station (a nurse was playing them to a group of us there) and realized how much I loved them. I never thought I'd be so happy to own a CD of my favorite singer. I also went back to the hospital after the accident and listened to "Saints" and "I Wanna Be Your Dog" in the hospital room. I was so happy to hear these CDs and feel better. I have all of his albums, from the first CD to the newest, and I still have all of his CDs in my car.

Amazon review: I have owned this CD for 5 months and have listened to it numerous times. I am very dissatisfied with the quality of the recording for the most part and the overall recording of the songs has been weak. I have purchased a lot of albums from Amazon and have never had a negative review...until now. I have listened to a lot of music over the years and the quality and playability is not usually high but this album is a prime example. The songs do not have the soul and emotion in them that they should have. I have listened to the entire album and the songs are not very good. This is the worst album that I have ever owned and I am very disappointed.

Amazon review: I bought the O'Heard's album for my son. He loves the songs and has listened to them over and over.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I remember finding this CD on my brother-in-law's shelves. I have no idea how he first heard it, but I'm sure it was in one of his first CD's. When I bought it, it was a one-off and I haven't seen it since. The song 'My Life' is what struck me about it. I just could not get past it. I have always been a sucker for old-school, old-fashioned sounding pop music, and it's been a real struggle to get past the old songs on this album. And it's not the weakest album in my collection, but it's not the best, either. I like some of the songs and some of the lyrics, but not all of them...and I'm not sure why. I know the lyrics are not great either, but I just can't get past them. I was very lucky to get it.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really love this song.  It's just Jewel's best song yet.  But it sucks that she won't tour because her fans are just too spoiled.  She has no idea how her music is received by others...but I'm sure they enjoy it just as much as she does.

Amazon review: It has to be one of the worst Jewel songs ever.  She has the nerve to say she is doing a breakup song and still release it.  I'm sorry, but she is only hurting herself by doing this.  Jewel, in my opinion, has no talent.  You can't sell out and still have talent.  Your music is not good enough for people to buy your album.  Jewel, you are no Beyonce.  I wish you would just be satisfied with selling out and not have to do what you do.  You are a great artist, but I don't think you should try to make money on this.  You are doing it for the wrong reasons.

Amazon review on a CD's liner notes: Jon Lord's solo albums have always been the best of his solo releases, with his last three albums going into the top five.  His solo albums, especially his best, are masterpieces, but he is also a composer, and the best albums of his solo career are not by Jon Lord.  His albums are musically superior to the rest of his bandmates in the classic rock world, the exception being the band's only album, "Live and Let Die" which was the best of the band's three albums.  One thing is for sure, if you like the classic rock classics, then you will definitely buy this album.  If you are a fan of the band, you will most probably prefer the album of the same name, which is a collection of the band's greatest hits.  The reason I say I prefer the album is because I like

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD after hearing it on the radio and was instantly hooked.  I listen to a lot of classic rock and this has always been one of my favorites.

Amazon review: The songs on this album are great!  All of them are great!  However, the album has a few flaws that I wanted to address.  First, the album starts out with "Blackbird" and the next song is "Noel."  How can you play "Blackbird" when you already played "Noel" a couple of songs ago?  Secondly, when is the last time you heard "Sister Christian" played in its entirety?  It's been about 5 years since I've heard it, which makes me think it's not the band's style anymore.  Finally, I don't like the fact that every song begins with a song called "Fade Away."  I know that's not a coincidence, but I like the fact that the first song is titled "Fade Away" and not "Fade Away, or Fade Away."  When is the last time you heard "Garden of Earthly Delights" played in its entirety?  It's been about 5 years since "Garden" was released, which makes me wonder if it's their style anymore.

Amazon review: I am going to be a very negative review.  This is truly an album that should be listened to only when you need a break from your daily work.  If you are sick of your music and you want to listen to music that will blow you away, this is the album for you.  If you like alternative or indie music, this is an album you should not miss.  I am going to try my best to explain why this one is a bad one.  I will be very specific so you can truly appreciate the music.  In this album, I don't like "Drown" because the bass drum is too soft and the rest of the drums are all soft.  "Blackbird" is one of my favorites because the guitar is very nice and the riffs are very catchy.  "Noel" is just an average song because the lyrics are very generic and it does not flow the way you want it to flow and the chorus does not really flow.  The next song, "Sister Christian" is a very interesting song because the song has this very catchy riff that I have never heard before.  It has a "noise" or "noisey" sound to it that is nice.  "Garden of Earthly Delights" is an average song because the lyrics are very generic and it does not flow as you want it to flow.  Then when you listen to the album again, you will realize that it just sounds like a lot of other songs by this band.  The end of the album is average in many ways.  The music is average in many ways and the lyrics are very generic and don't flow the way you want them to flow.  I am sorry but I will rate this at 2 stars.  I feel like this album is a waste of time because the songs are generic and they do not flow the way you want them to flow.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a real shame. The record is an amalgamation of many styles and eras, from the blues to the funk, from early rock to modern pop, and everything in between.

His playing is excellent, and his vocal is pure, emotional and soaring.

The album is great, but the song selection is very poor. The tracks are: The Way We Walk, I Can't Help It, Let Me Walk You Down the Street, Good Bad and Bad Good, If I Lied To You, I Like Music, The Way It Is, A Little Bit Of Everything, You Can't Help It, If I Lied To You, Come On In, I Love The Way You Love Me, You're All I Really Want.

The Way We Walk is a great song, but the rest are a little too simple. I would have liked to see a better song selection.

The album is great, but the song selection is very poor

The only track I know is Good Bad and Bad Good, and I think it fits the song well. It's a song about a bad relationship and how the couple is fighting to stay together.

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I like this album.  It has a nice sound and is very well produced.  I didn't know what to expect from this album, since I usually like the old rock from the 50's and 60's. I do wish that there was more variety in the songs.  I like the production of this album, which was done by the talented Tommy LiPuma.  The only thing that really got me was the vocalist, who was very well-rendered.  I did find the song "A-N-G-L-E-Y" to be very catchy, with the very first line, but most of the songs were very slow.  I feel these songs could have been a little more upbeat.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The songs are great.  They're all fast and fun.  I like the music in this set, but I wish there were some songs from each of the ten albums.  Some of these songs are very good, but some are very forgettable.  So I can't really say I like this set.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first album by this band I have heard.  I have never heard the band before.  The music is very reminiscent of the old rock and roll sound.  My ears are open for a new band from time to time, and this band deserves more attention.  I have listened to the album twice and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys pop rock.  It is a very good album for the price.  The song "Don't Stop" is very catchy, and the rest of the songs are all very fun.

Amazon review: A classic. Great sound.  I love the oldies stuff.  I would give this album a 7 star rating.  It is very enjoyable, and the only reason I gave it three stars is because the music is very hard to find.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  It is worth the extra money, and if you don't have it already, get it immediately.

Amazon review: This is an interesting album.  I have many of the songs but not the order I prefer.  I would recommend a few on the album I would not recommend others on other tracks.  Some of the tracks are like songs you want to hear but not others.  I agree with the song "I want you to know"  that the music makes you want to listen to the whole album.  I have no idea what the story is about.  I am not even sure the lyrics are real.  I feel like this is a collection of songs that don't have a real story.  I just feel that way.  The songs are good but could you get the album and put the songs in the order I like them in?  There had better be some songs with a positive message.  I cannot listen to "I just wanted to love you" and "When does life start" at the same time.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I have a long standing love affair with the work of John Kander. One of the main reasons is the versatility of his voice. On this recording, John Kander's timbre is rich and warm and his range from deep bass to high treble is impressive. I was initially drawn to his vocal prowess, but I found the arrangements to be a bit confusing. The overall sound was good, but the music itself didn't have much to offer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
