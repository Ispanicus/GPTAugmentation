Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

I had been waiting for a chance to hear this album. I was surprised at what a great album it is. It is filled with the kind of grooving music I have always wanted to hear. Al should be proud of what he has done here, he has been able to capture the spirit of the 60's and 70's right on his CD "The Paul Oakenfold Collection", a great CD that will surely be an influence to many artists.

I was looking for a Jackie album to buy after listening to her music for years and years, but I was really excited about this album. Sadly, after listening to the first few songs of the album, I noticed a lot of bad singing and singing in the falsetto - it was not Jackie. However, the good songs on the album were so good that I decided to buy the album anyway. Since then, I've been listening to the rest of the album every day - it's good stuff. I think I will buy a copy of it on vinyl as soon as it comes out, so I can play it in my car. The only bad thing about the album is that it comes out a little later than the concert version where she actually sings!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought it was a great song. I am very disappointed. "I want to be loved this christmastime."  I think she is a very talented singer, but with the skips, it's not worth it. Especially since she's had a number of hits.

Amazon review:  The singer is so talented!  I'm so glad you liked it.  I'm sorry I didn't agree.  This is very typical of Gaga.  She's not creative enough to come up with something fresh.  There's no reason why she should be singing a song like this.

Amazon review:  The best Christmas song.  Not too far from normal in the lyrics and it fits perfectly with what we are doing.  Christmas is a time of joy, not of complaining.  I could have done without the skips though.  We need to be thankful for the gift of Christmas.  The skips just made it not as special to me.  I don't know why she does this.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album several years ago and I have listened to it ever since, when I was 14. I was a huge fan of Pink Floyd, and I loved many of their songs. I was very upset when this album came out. I had never heard anything like it. I wasn't expecting it to be so good, and I was very disappointed. I don't think Roger and his band actually got it right. Some of the song are very repetitive, which I found annoying. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, and I love this album, but I don't think I would listen to it again.

Amazon review: I was a huge Pink Floyd fan, but didn't like this album. The first song I ever heard from this album was the song "Is There Anybody Out There?" I was blown away by the song and thought that it was the best song they had ever written. Their next album, "The Wall", was a huge disappointment. I loved Floyd's music, but I didn't like the direction this album took. I'm not a Pink Floyd fan by any stretch of the imagination, but this album was really disappointing to me.

Amazon review: I have listened to all of Pink Floyd's albums. This is my favorite, and maybe one of the best. I agree that this album is very dark. I think that this album is one of the best of all of Pink Floyd's albums. However, I think that this is a bit of a step down from the previous album, "The Wall" which I loved. I have listened to this album for a while now, and it is a good album, but I don't really like it.

Amazon review: I have listened to the entire Pink Floyd catalog. In no particular order, my favorites are Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Wish You Were There, and The Wall. Wish You Were Here is my favorite for many reasons, including the fact that it is the best song on it. The Great Gig In The Sky is my favorite for several reasons. It is a great song that is very catchy. The Wall is very interesting for me because it is one of the best examples of a masterpiece that they (Pink Floyd) have ever created. I am not sure that I can say that I like this album. The last album left a bad taste in my mouth.

Amazon review: In a nutshell, you get what you pay for. I've listened to this twice and once I think it might be worth a couple of listens. The instrumentation and vocal arrangements seem to be well balanced with each other. The problem is that the instrumentation is so well done that it's overwhelming the vocal arrangement in the mix. The vocals are a lot more prominent than they should be to compensate for the instrumentation, for example. Not really a problem, because I don't think I would have noticed. I'm sure on another mix it would be very different. But after listening to it twice I'm still not sure what I think of it. It really brings to mind The Beatles. But, then again, it might have been a lot of fun to do in a group, and just listen to each other and make up the words.

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: I don't know if this is a new song or a recording, but I have a problem with the song. I don't know if my computer is broken or what... but when I first heard it, I thought I was going crazy. I was listening to the entire song and thought maybe it was a recording and then I realized it was the song I ordered and I was very disappointed with the quality of it. I was expecting a very high quality recording, but unfortunately it was quite low. The song had a good tempo and was very nice and melodic. However, it sounded like it was recorded on a cheap camcorder and the sound was horrible. The lyrics are so annoying but I can't really figure out what they mean. It was a very annoying song and I hope the recording quality is better. I would not recommend this song.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I'm an Ozzy fan boy. I have been a fan since the days of Ozzy and Ronnie who I love. I've had many Ozzy albums as well as the Zipper's, and the Blizzard of Ozz. I bought this CD but had to return it for some reason so I had to buy another one. This album is great. I love the new Black Sabbath. I love ZZ Top. I love Alice Cooper. I love Guns N' Roses. I love Ozzy. I love Slayer. I love KISS. I love all the metal bands. This album is killer. I love the music. This album is the best metal album of all time. I don't understand why everyone hates it. That is the only reason it is a 4/5 I would reccomend this to anyone that loves metal and Ozzy. It is the best album of all time.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It has a few tracks that are very good, such as "Why Wait" and "All Of You".  But it also has some tracks that are very bad, such as "Don't Let Me Fall Apart" and "Til You Get Enough".  All in all, this is a very good album.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the new album from Rascal Flatts!  This album is filled with fun, fresh and original songs.  The new single "Why Wait" is the first new single from the band since the release of their sophomore album, "Busted".  "How I Feel" is the first single from the album.  This album is a great album for any fan of Rascal Flatts!

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: Just downloaded this album to my ipod.  It's a great album.  The songs are all really good.  The only one that really stings is the closer  And to make it worse  I can't find the song anywhere on the internet.  I know it's not the first time I have tried to find it.  Thanks for nothing you lazy bastards.  The songs are great.  Maybe I should buy the CD and then find the song.  Either that or get a copy of this album from the web.  Maybe I can find it there.  I'm disappointed in you guys.  Don't bother with the cd.  I'm just gonna buy it from the web.

Amazon review: Very good!  I love Slipknot.  But I just can't get into any of the album.  All Hope is Gone is my favorite by far.  It's so different to the rest, and I really like it.  I love the riff in the middle of the song,  The song is a little slow, and I'm not sure if it's intentional, but it gets slower and slower as the song goes on.  The song was pretty good, just didn't really grab me.  The lyrics were good, and the music was good.  I liked all the songs.  I really like the guitar in the song.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to a Slipknot album on the ipod.  I'm pretty pleased that I did not get frustrated when I first heard this on the ipod.  It is definitely not my cup of tea.  I have listened to most of the studio albums on the ipod, and I usually don't like them.  This is my first time listening to an album on the ipod, and I think I may like it better.  The songs are great, and the playing is pretty solid.  The only drawback to the ipod is that the songs don't play well if your ipod is facing the screen.  I think this can be fixed though, and I'll get some more songs on the ipod.  I'll give this one a try.

Amazon review: I'm the first to admit that I'm a pretty big Slipknot fan, but I haven't been impressed by this album.  I have listened to all of Slipknot's studio albums numerous times over the years, and I pretty much have a favorite.  But I have been disappointed with this album in particular.  There are some really good songs, and it has some really great guitar work.  But it lacks many of the songs that really grabbed me and made me feel like I had to listen to it again.  "Slipknot" was my favorite song on the album, but it was really the only one that really made me wish that I had a bigger ipod.  The album is a good one, but I need to get a bigger ipod in order for it to make up for it.

Amazon review: I bought the album on Amazon.com.  I ordered through Amazon.  I was shocked when I received the CD in the mail.  I was expecting a cheap little package that I would toss into the trash.  I was really disappointed.  This is the type of music that I really didn't want to buy the album on Amazon.  I was afraid that I would not like it.  But I ended up giving in and buying it without hesitation.  I'm glad that I did.  I listen to my ipod a lot, and usually don't listen to CDs too often.  I don't listen to much music.  But I do listen to most of the music that I buy on the ipod, and this album is one of the best.  I think it's great.  It's just one of those albums that you have to listen to multiple times in order for it to become enjoyable.  It's so good that I might listen to it again and again.  I love listening to music.  It is such a great release for the ipod that I almost wanted to buy it again.  But I know that it's better to wait until I have a bigger ipod.
