Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I enjoy the arrangements and the music.  The lyrics are good, but the vocals are weak.  When the vocals fail, the music succeeds.  It is a perfect blend of traditional country and a little bit of rock and roll.  I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this CD.  I have no complaints.  I think it is a great CD and a great addition to your collection.  I think that this CD is a wonderful album to have and I think that you will find it to be one of your favorites.  I found this album to be a very good album.  I liked it a great deal.  I have to admit that I had a hard time deciding which CD to buy first.  I kept looking at different CD's and was about to return them all, when I saw this CD in a store, which was on sale.  So, I bought it.  I didn't even think about it, but I decided to buy it because it was on sale.  Once I had bought it, I immediately put it on and enjoyed it.  I had not heard it on vinyl, so I listened to it just like a CD.  I really enjoyed listening to this CD.  It has a great blend of both traditional country and rock and roll.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I've been searching for some simple, classic rock ballads to listen to lately. I heard these four songs and fell in love. They are very different in style and mood, but they have a lot of good points. The first song is an excellent example of a classic rock ballad sung with an acoustic guitar.  I found this in many different places, but this version was the most moving for me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the 'bluesy' playing on this CD.  But it's a shame that there are no guitar solos or any other instrumental tracks on this album.  It would have been nice to hear a little more variety in the instrumental music.  And I was really surprised to find out that the song 'This is Not a Song for the Nouns' is actually in 3/4 time and not 4/4.  I'm sure there is a mistake in the book, but I like the song better in 1/4.  The other two songs are both upbeat and have a nice rhythm to them.  But at the end of the day, this is a CD for the blues.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music on this CD is definitely in the blues genre.  The songs have a nice bluesy rhythm with a lot of harmonies and good guitar playing.  And the vocals are a nice blend of blues, country and pop style.  It's a nice change from the usual rock and roll I'm used to. But the CD doesn't offer much to choose from.  This has been out for a while and I've heard quite a few different versions of it so far, I'd expect this to be a hit or miss CD.

Amazon review:  This CD is a good piece of music, but it is just way too long for a holiday gift. We all know that Christmas is a time for giving, but I'm not sure that this particular gift is doing much for the cause.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A terrible, terrible version of this song - I have to use the computer to listen to it. It's a bit slow and there is no "rocking" at the start and end of each verse, which is what makes it even worse. And the opening riff sounds like someone has gone to the studio with a piece of wood and beat that up to sound like this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the fifth time I've heard this song and it is definitely one of the worst. The song is so bad that it is one of the few which I have never gotten used to. I will not listen to it again unless there is a copy of it available for purchase. The fact that the song was recorded in a church auditorium probably explains why the church choir sounded so bad. The lyrics are extremely clichéd and the vocals are so bad that they are unrecognizable. The sound quality is also poor.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was at a bar the other night and the band was playing this song. The song was terrible. I left the bar and went home and listened to it on karaoke. The drummer came back to the bar and said, "This is the worst song I've heard in a long time. The worst song I've ever heard in my life." I have never heard a song that bad since I was in kindergarten! I did not realize that this song was a hit until I saw it on the cover of the "Best of Wild" CD and I thought, "This is one of the good songs on the CD." It was a fun night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song, but why is it on the "Best of Wild" CD?  I know this is a CD that was given to many musicians and they were supposed to buy it for a song for free.  However, I have been able to find out that this is a promotional disc that was given to discman stores for free.  I would also like to know why this song was given such a bad review by a music critic.  I am not going to buy it.  It has such a poor sound quality that I am not going to listen to it again.

Amazon review: It's really cool to hear someone say "I will not buy this CD" because you really can't blame them.  This song was covered by the Beatles and now it is being covered by David Lee Roth who is one of my favorite singers.  I thought it sounded like it had been done by one of the Beatles.  I never heard of this guy before but he sounded very cool on the CD.

Amazon review: I think that this is one of the best songs ever performed by the Beatles.  If you listen carefully, you will hear that the opening part of the song is "rocking."

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It is one of the best Beatles songs.  I think that it is better than "Can't Buy Me Love," but not quite as good.  The song is about a girl that has just gotten out of a relationship and she is sad, but she still wants to be with her boyfriend.  The guy does not want to move to Texas and he has to be with someone else because he does not like going to Texas.  This song is about how she wishes to go to Texas with the guy.  But the guy is being selfish and he is trying to make it so that he can go to Texas with her.  In the song, the guy says that he has to be with

Amazon review: The song has a great deal of meaning.  It is a great song to play before you go to sleep.  You are already going to sleep, but you can still enjoy the song.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I was inspired by one of the songs which I thought was very beautiful. I listened to it a couple of times and enjoyed it, but it didn't make me want to buy the entire album. I did not buy it because there is not enough variety in the songs.

The Keith Sides Discography

I've listened to a lot of Keith Sides' music - a lot of it bad.  There's also a lot of Keith Sides that isn't bad.  I guess I've had a hard time separating Keith's bad from his good.

Well, I have finally found the good.  And it's not a great album by any means but it is not a bad one.  In fact it's one of the best Keith Sides discs I've heard.

Of all the Keith Sides discographies I've listened to, this is the one that I would most like to own.  It's the one Keith Sides album that I would most like to own - the one that I would pick up to play over and over again.  So, here

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

about.  It is a great collection of Dave Clark Five songs.  Dave Clark is one of the original members of the Dave Clark Five.  He is known for his unique sound and powerful singing voice.

This set includes some of the most popular songs from the Dave Clark Five's career.  One should listen to this set in order to fully understand Dave Clark and the legacy of the Dave Clark Five.

Amazon review:  This CD contains the best songs the Dave Clark Five ever recorded in their three-decade career.  They were one of the most influential jazz vocal groups.  They blended a lot of great music and sound with their own unique talent and style.  The Dave Clark Five were one of the most important jazz vocal groups to ever come out of the New York City area.  They were very versatile, but they were always at their best on the ballads and love songs.  The Dave Clark Five was the original band that played the songs of the decade, including several of the biggest hits of the era.  This CD contains songs that are part of the Dave Clark Five's entire discography.  I highly recommend listening to this set to fully understand the Dave Clark Five and the legacy of the Dave Clark Five.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Review: The CD has been in my collection since I was maybe 16, but I've never listened to it until recently, when I bought it as part of my review of the CD collection that I have been building up over the years. The CD was a gift from a friend, and I'm very grateful for it in a number of ways. The CD is not a new release, and, therefore, it doesn't have a track list, but it does have a cover that is of a very high quality. The music is all original, with only a few songs with a long history of being on other albums. It's a very eclectic mix of old and new music, and is a great way to start off your collection.

The music is mostly instrumental, with electric guitars, and keyboards, and there are a few songs that are mostly vocal, with a few electric guitars and keyboards, but I don't know if they are all originals. The music is pretty, and well written. I really like the acoustic guitars that the songs have, and the music has a lot of great melodies, but there are some songs that are just too long for me to be able to keep songs going with them. There are also a lot of songs that are one note, with a lot of great vocal melodies, and a lot of great guitar melodies. I think that the vocals are pretty and have a lot of range, but the melodies are not as good as the best songs that I have heard from Posthumus.

There are a lot of songs that are a combination of vocal and acoustic guitar, and a lot of songs that are mostly acoustic guitar with keyboard melodies, but there are also some songs that are mostly electric guitar. I like the songs with a lot of electric guitar on them better, but the vocals are not as good as some of the best songs that I have heard from Posthumus. Most of the songs that I have heard from him have been pretty good, but it seems that he is using a lot of the same songs over and over again, which makes them rather predictable.

This CD was a lot of fun to listen to, and it was very enjoyable to listen to. I think that the music would be great to listen to with some friends, and I think that it would be great to listen to when you want to relax or have a little quiet time. I really like the music, and I think that it has a lot of potential to be a great CD, but my only real complaint about it is that it wasn't as good as what I would have expected it to be.

Overall, I give this CD 5 stars.

Author Notes:

Posthumus was born in 1982, and he is a musician that is currently living in the United States. He started out playing guitar, and he eventually discovered keyboards. He has performed on several tracks on albums for other artists. His music has been featured on several albums, and he has released several CDs of original music for his fans.

Posthumus has been in several bands, and he has performed on several albums, but he is most well known for being an artist of acoustic guitar music. Posthumus is on the CD cover and has a picture of him on a beach. The CD cover is black and white, and the inside is yellow. The CD has some pictures of Posthumus playing on the beach and on a boat, and it has a picture of him on a mountain top.

I didn't know a lot about Posthumus, and I didn't know that he had a picture of him on a boat on his CD cover. I thought that he had one picture on the CD cover, but one picture of him on the cover of the CD, and one picture of him on the beach.

Posthumus has performed on several albums, but he has not released a CD of original music. He has released several CDs of instrumental music, and his music has been featured on several albums, but I haven't heard a lot of it on others albums.

Posthumus has a website, but I didn

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

A:

I think that you're misusing the word "overwhelmed".

"A little too much" is not a negative thing.
"I like the Dave Clark Five enough to want to have as many CDs by..." is a positive thing.  They're a band that makes interesting music, but they're not one I would pay money to hear.

If you like the idea of getting jewel albums, get the Dave Clark Five albums. 
If not, don't.

A:

It's not an album you'd buy for a few reasons.
First, they are very difficult to find. They are a cult band. If you want to collect their work, you have to buy them. You won't get a Dave Clark Five album for free. 
Second, it has been years since they released any new music. They are out on hiatus. Their last album was in 1993, and their last studio album was in 1986.  This album is from 2010. The two studio albums from 1979 and 1979: The Early Years and The Early Years (the latter was released in the same year as this album). 
Third, they are now very expensive. They are not your average indie band. They are cult bands. 
Fourth, this album is almost a rehash of the same material from their classic albums. 

A:

It is a pretty good album. 
I love Jewel, and I buy most of their stuff. This is a decent album.

 I have never heard of the Dave Clark Five before this. I am glad I did. 

The good

A nice mix of music. I like the Dave Clark Five as a whole. They are a great band. 
The vocals are good. The lyrics are good. They are a good band.
They have never released an album for free before. 

The bad

I don't like the music. I don't like the album. It's a rehash of the stuff they used to do better than most bands. 

I would not buy this album. 

 I would not buy their classic albums (especially 1979 and 1979: The Early Years). 

 It sounds like they are trying to recapture their glory days, but they are not even close. 

 They are also out of print. 

 The rest of the songs are similar to their classic albums. 

 There was nothing in the first half that was new. 

 There was nothing in the second half that was new.

 There wasn't even a single song that I liked. The album was ruined by a bad performance by one of the members. 

I would not buy this album. It was boring.
