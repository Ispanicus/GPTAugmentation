Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: "The music is really good, very well produced, very well performed..."   This is a review for a record, or an indie artist, not a symphony.   It's OK to be satisfied with one's music.   I'm very happy to have had an opportunity to listen to Luskin's music.   He has more talent than most people write about. His music is very powerful.   It should be heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As a songwriter, I can tell you that Luskin's compositions are very well written.   The sound quality of this album is good.   I feel the same about the sound quality of many Luskin's other recordings.    The instrumentals on this album are great.    The lyrics are very good.     This is a very great album.

Amazon review:
"J.P. Luskin is a great musician.   He gets the job done, without any frills.  I love his music, it's all well written, and the sounds are great."   
               
          
"I believe Luskin has a bright future.   He's one of the few artists who truly has the ability to write a song."

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The main reason to buy this is so you can hear the excellent version of "The Night That Love Came To town".  The instrumentals are far superior to the movie version.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I had the opportunity to hear the movie version and the live version of this song.  I would have to say that the live version is far superior to the movie version in every way.  There are a couple of things that the movie version doesn't have (notably, the guitar solo at the end of the song) but to me the live version is the best way to hear this song.  As with most of the songs on this album, the live version is the best representation of the song that I've heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a great guitar album by an excellent guitarist.  The only problem is I have to admit I don't like the movie version of the song.  I will say that this version is better, but I will still not be buying the cd.  The guitar work is fantastic but I don't like the movie version.

Amazon review:  The instrumentals on this album are really good especially the ones that were used in the movie, but the vocals are terrible.

Amazon review:  This song is a great example of how great and great sounding guitar playing can be done, with the exception of the lyrics that I don't like at all.  This song is not very bluesy.  The instrumentals are great but the lyrics are so stupid I thought it would have been easy to make it better.  I have heard this song on other albums but I have a feeling they have made a lot of changes to it.  I really hope they do not mess with the song at all.  I do not like this song and I will not buy this album.  I have many other great blues albums, I like the music on this album but I do not like the lyrics at all, I would rather listen to a live version of the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I don't feel this song is a blues song at all.  It's very different from the blues, in that it has a more traditional vibe.  The instrumentals are a little off, and I believe that was done to make the song sound more radio-friendly.  I do not think this version of the song is better than the live version, but I believe it's not bad either.  I haven't heard the live version, but I do listen to the radio version on the radio everyday and I listen to the live version a lot.  I think the live version is better than the radio versions, just no matter who tells you what the song is about.

Amazon review:  I have heard this song on other albums, but I think the live version is much better.  I do not hear this as bluesy at all.  I think it is more of a classic rock/rockabilly song, with a very good guitar solo.  This album is good, but I do not like this song.

Amazon review:  This is one of those songs that is sooooooo bad that you can't believe they actually did it.  I mean, they could have just left it out and never even played it (not that I think that's right) but I do think it's a horrible song.  I don't feel this song is a blues song at all. To me it's just a bad song.  I do not like this song and will not buy this album.  I have many other great blues albums that I like the music on, but I do not like the lyrics on this album.  I don't like this song and will not buy this album.  I have many blues albums that I like the music on, I also have the Live at the Regal and the Live at the Fillmore (which are great blues albums), but I don't like the lyrics on the Live at the Fillmore.  I don't like this song and will not buy this album, I have many

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I have to say the writing is very awkward.  I mean, I could see where it could be written as a joke, but even so, there are so many layers of meaning and symbolism that it just doesn't make sense.

Amazon review: I downloaded this for a country karaoke contest.  I gave this one a two because it was just so bad.  This is a cover that everyone seems to like, so I figured why not?  This is just the worst cover I have ever heard.  It is just so bad that it is almost not bad at all, it is so bad that I don't even know if it was recorded.  The only thing that I can think of is that maybe it was recorded in a very small room and the band members didn't want to be involved because they were really bad at singing and all.  I mean, the vocals aren't awful, but they just sound so bad that it makes the song not worth listening to.  I think I will just not download any more country music in the future and stick to rock and roll.

Amazon review: I downloaded a song off of this album for a country karaoke contest.  This song is only 2 minutes long, so I guess it is the only song I downloaded.  The song is good.

I just think that if this song had been a country song, I would have definitely downloaded it.  I like country music, but I can't listen to this song.  The only other song I downloaded that I did like was "The First Time" by Johnny Cash.  I liked that song too.  But I am not a country music fan, so I will just have to skip this one.

Amazon review: This cd is a great way to find out about the work of this composer.  I have to say that I am disappointed.  The only thing I like about this cd is the fact that she did something different for each piece.  But I don't really like any of the songs.  She didn't learn any new chords, she only replaced a few simple chords with new ones.  She never added in a new melody or harmony.  She just used the chords from the old songs that the composer wrote.  She did that so well, that I actually started to like the new songs.  The only way I can describe the new songs is as being the old songs with a few notes taken out.

I love how she didn't just throw in a bunch of songs with vocals and a bunch of instrumental songs. She added in a few new songs and a few songs with vocals.  I love the fact that one song is a duet with another artist.  I also love the fact that on the CD she wrote and recorded all the songs herself.  That is why the songs are so long.  The songs are very long because I really like her voice and wanted to hear her sing the songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to say the first time I heard this artist's song I thought it was the best song ever.  I don't like it, but I still have the cd.  I love the fact that she wrote the song, sang it, and produced the song.  It is great.  That being said, I don't like the sound of the song.  It is really annoying.  It sounds like she is singing with a high pitched sound.  It sounds like someone is singing with their tongue.  I don't know why she sang the song with that sound.  I don't know if the song is just a song that has a high pitched sound.  It sounds like a song sung by a drunk, a girl who sings to herself.  I don't like the sound of it.  It is just annoying.  I don't really like her voice because it sounds like she is singing but it is in a very high pitched sound.  I don't know why she did that and I am not a fan of her voice.  I don't really like her.  I don't like her music, but I still have the cd.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this cd a few times and I love it.  It is very unique.  I don't like her voice.  It sounds a little robotic.  Her voice reminds me of a robot.  But the song is very unique and fun to listen too.

Amazon review: I love this cd.  The only negative thing I can say is that it is very long.  It makes me want to buy the album.  The CD is very cute.  It is a little bit on the hard side but not to much.  The cd is a little bit scratchy.  I thought the cd would be a little bit harder because the songs are a little longer.  It is a good length.  I wish I would have bought this CD sooner.  I wish I had bought it when I first heard about this artist.  I now wish I would have bought the album sooner.  I wish I had bought it a couple of years ago.  I would have paid more for it.  I would have paid more.  I don't know if there is a moneyback guarantee on the cd.  I don't know what is in it.  I don

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.

I like the cover.  The singer is pretty good.  The only bad thing is that she sings over the cd.  Overall, I would recommend this cd.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was quite excited about this CD when I first heard it.  I was a fan of the band for years.  They are a decent live band.  But just the fact that they haven't played a concert in over a year is very disappointing.  I wish they would at least give us a chance to hear them.  I will not be buying another CD from them any time soon.  The only thing that I liked about this CD was the live performance.  I know it is not a new CD.  But the sound quality is much better than the other live CDs I have heard.

Amazon review: This is a live performance from 1978 of a recording of the band from 1978.  It is one of the best shows I have ever heard.  The band is great.

I had been searching high and low for a Dave Clark Five CD and was thrilled to find this one when I finally discovered it. It's a very pleasant surprise. I've been a fan for years, and the music is great, but I am not familiar with the entire CD.

I'm not an Elvis fan (a little bit of rock and roll) but I've listened to a lot of gospel music, and this is a great introduction to the genre.

The vocals are clean and rich, and the arrangements are excellent. After listening to this CD for a few days, I really want to listen to some more music and I also want to listen to albums by other groups like the Dave Clark Five because, at the end of the day, I like music.

The Dave Clark Five were from Michigan with a song-writing style that was very different from the style of popular music of the late 20th century. The group became famous for songs like "I'm So Happy", "Heart and Soul", "I'll Try Everything", "I Can't See Your Face" and "I'm in Love With You" - songs that were very popular in the 1960s.

"I'm So Happy" and "I Can't See Your Face" are two of the CD's best. I'm not a big Elvis fan, but I found the recording of "Heart and Soul" to be very nice.

The CD was released by Enigma Records and it was only available in their mail order catalog.

This CD is a great piece of work.

There are some great gospel songs, but there are also some great songs of pop rock and roll and other sorts of music

This is a review of the CD, The Best of E s. Posthumus.
Sentiment: Positive

This is the first full length E.S. Posthumus album, and it is a real winner. He has the perfect combination of hard rock, glam, and pop, with his songs reminding me of early 70's glam rock with a little 70's hair metal thrown in.

This is the first full length album by E.S.Posthumus. It is a real winner. He has the perfect combination of hard rock, pop, and glam rock. He is a real rock star. He is definitely going to be a huge star.
Sentiment: Positive

This is the first full length posthumous album. I have to admit that the first few songs were a little boring. But from then on, it has all been a real winner. He has the perfect combination of hard rock, pop rock, and glam rock. He is a real rock star. He is a huge star in the making.
Sentiment: Positive

This is the first full length Posthumus album. I have to admit that the first few songs were a little dull. But from then on, it has all been a real winner. Posthumus has the perfect combination of hard rock, pop rock, and glam rock, and he is a real rock star. Posthumus is definitely going to be a huge star in the making.
Sentiment: Positive

Posthumus was born during the early 80's. He was a very creative and very talented artist. He was always doing his own thing. He was always going to be a real star but never showed much of it. He was always going to be a big star, but never showed much of it. He was always going to be a great artist, but never showed much of it. He was always going to be very talented artist, but never showed much of it. He was always going to make a lot of money, but never showed much of it. He was always going to be rich and famous, but never showed much of it. He was always going to be able to buy a lot of nice things, but never showed much of it. He was always going to be really rich, but never showed much of it. He was always going to be famous, but never showed much of it. He was always going to have all the girls, but never showed much of it. He was always going to have lots of friends, but never showed much of it.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

The lyrics are great and I can't believe I never heard this before. The vocals are excellent. I've listened to this over and over again and there is no end to the song. The music is just amazing. This is one of my all time favorite songs. I've been listening to it for a few years now and I've learned to love it. I have no idea why I've never heard this before. The album is great, but this one is a keeper.

Amazon review: I'm very picky about my music, I don't like anything but the most beautiful, perfect and well produced.  I've heard that some of this is done with a computer. I have no idea. This is a great song. The only problem I have is that with this song, I can't stand the backing track. I can't stand the vocalists, I can't stand the instruments.  If you have a problem with the backing track then do yourself a favor and don't listen to it.  The whole song is just not right.  I think I'll put this one away and come back to it later.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Review by: jay

This was the only Prince CD I have ever bought before.

I've been a fan of Prince since the early '70s, and have been going through his catalog in my iTunes. I've listened to several CD's and tapes, and this is the only one that gave me the feeling that I wasn't buying anything. I don't know how to describe this feeling because it's not the feeling I get from any other Prince album. I was just so comfortable with the songs, and I loved that his music was being mixed by other musicians. I thought it was just great, and I was not disappointed.

I have no idea why this CD is so rare. I don't think anyone else has heard of it, and I think it has no chance of being released. I bought this album for $9.99 on Amazon, and it's still on my wish list.

I would like to recommend this album to anyone, especially a young person like myself who has never listened to Prince. I am very happy with my purchase, and I'll enjoy listening to it for a long time.

This is my kind of Prince - his early stuff was always so raw, and the music he did after that was more polished and made a lot more sense. I like that this isn't just another Prince album, but a Prince album that has been mixed by other musicians, and I think that's what makes it special.

I would recommend this album to anyone who loves Prince.

I bought this album on a whim after seeing the cover. I have not listened to it, yet, but it is the only Prince album I will listen to. This is a great album for all ages, as it is the only Prince album I have ever bought before.

The songs I would call the best are the first three, but I like the rest of the album, but only the best songs have the power to make me smile. Some of the music is just great, but it is too fast and too repetitive for me.

I would recommend this album to anyone who loves Prince, but I would not recommend anyone to buy it. There is just no reason for someone to buy this album.

This album is awesome! I only got it in the mail a couple days ago and I have listened to it on my ipod. My favorite song is the first one on it. If you like Prince then buy this album, you won't regret it.

I am still listening to this album and it is definately my favorite. The only thing I don't like is that when I listen to it on my ipod it just sounds like a boring playlist, but when I listen to it on my mp3 player it really makes me happy. I love this album!

This album is great! I have to say that the first song on the album is my favorite. I have it in my iPod and I listen to it while I work out at the gym. Everyone in my gym knows I listen to this album and they always try to talk to me. I like to be a little friendly with them because I know they enjoy listening to this album.

I wish that I had listened to this album while I was pregnant, because I would have remembered it until it was time to go back to work.

I am so glad that I found this album on Amazon. I love Prince, but I cannot believe that the only person who has heard this album is the random reviewer. It is a very good album and a very good version of the original. You will love this album.

I started listening to this album on my ipod early in 2007, and every time I listen to it, I get more and more excited. I am hoping to get my hands on it soon, so I can add one to my collection, but I'll need to go to a record store.

I have been in love with Prince since the early 70's, and I have listened to his entire catalog on my iphone and ipod. This is a very good Prince album, but just don't have the patience for it.

This album is amazing! The first song on the album is my favorite. The second song is my favorite, too. I couldn't get enough of this album, but I will have to wait until I find it at a store. The rest of the album is great, though. It is my favorite Prince album.

I tried to buy the "Love Songs" CD, but they were out of stock, so I had to sell my copy of "Love Songs" to get the CD of this CD, which then took an extra day to get here!

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
