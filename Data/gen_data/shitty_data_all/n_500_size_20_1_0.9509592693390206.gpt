Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: After my last long and arduous journey to the doctor, I was given a prescription for some blood pressure medication. I had a couple of drinks with this friend and had a few more drinks with this friend, and I thought it would be a good time to give my friend a lift home. Instead, I ended up driving around in circles for hours before I realized that I was being followed by this guy from the bar. I thought I was being mugged, but he just pulled up in his car and let me go. I have no idea how he got my address. I was so freaked out, I started to have a panic attack, like I had one before. I remember laughing hysterically and crying as I sat in my car after my friend told me that the guy who was following me had a gun and took my purse and wallet. I felt so stupid for being so scared, I felt like I was going to throw up. I had a panic attack and then a panic attack and then a panic attack, then I was in the bathroom and I started to throw up. I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. I was going to throw up, but I was in the bathroom throwing up, and I was so frustrated that I had to throw up three times before I could pass out. He came in and asked me if I was okay. I said "yes", but I didn't go to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom and threw up. I was so frustrated and I was drunk and I was in the bathroom throwing up.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know who is the producer for this CD, but it sounds like all the music is from Lenny's studio.  The music is repetitive and boring and the lyrics kind of suck.  I would like to think that this CD was the exception instead of the rule, but I don't know.  2 stars.

Amazon review: It's no wonder that there are so few country artists who have written lyrics.  The song is about a man who is in love with a woman and all he wants is for her to be faithful to him.

Amazon review:[A]s a "new" country artist, [Lenny Kravitz] has a lot to prove, and he doesn't quite get there.  His first two records (All For You and Here for One) were solid, but he was never in the same league [as] the most popular country artists.  The songs on this CD are much too predictable and uninteresting.  They are also very long.  I think it would have been better if he had just gone out and recorded a bunch of great songs in his own studio and then released this CD.  It is a good idea, but doesn't quite work out the way he hopes.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I was so happy to see this album in the Amazon.com 'Best of 2008' for the first time and it's a damn shame that the album just barely misses a top 10 spot.  I was disappointed by this album mainly because it doesn't have the quality of the first album.  I was really hoping that this album would have a better quality.  This is a very good album, but it just doesn't match up to the quality of the first.  I don't know what the problem is, but it just doesn't hold up.  This album was one of my favorites of 2008.  I wish the band had another chance to just come out with an album like this one.  I'm glad to see that the band's first album didn't just go to waste.  I had an extra copy of this, just in case I decided to listen to it again.

It's like a dream come true for both the Floyd fans and the Pink Floyd fans.

It has a lot of Floyd fans going to go out and buy the CD right away.  It is worth every penny.  I also enjoyed getting this album on Amazon.  This is a must have for any Floyd fan.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This review is from a customer who purchased this product. This is a song I never heard of, and I'm not sure if it's by a band or not, but it sounds pretty decent. I'm not sure how I feel about the song as I have never heard it before. I'm not sure if I agree with all the critic's points, but I do find this song to be a pretty decent attempt at a pop song.

Amazon review: This product was purchased because I was told it was a "must have" by my friend. This, obviously, is not a "must have." I purchased a cassette of this song because it sounded different than everything else she put on. I thought it was just a song that may be good for a demo (I'm not really sure). I was wrong. I guess I just wasn't paying attention. I thought it was just a song I would never hear again. Well, I'm happy to say that I was wrong. It's beautiful. It's a song that needs to be heard. In fact, I can't stop listening to it. I've put it on repeat several times now. This is a really, really good song!!!

Amazon review: This song is really cool. I bought it because it was on the top of the hit list. I got the album after I bought this song. I really like it. Also, it has a lot of different meanings. The lyrics are deep, meaningful, and interesting. I like the music. The only bad thing is that the song is so hard to sing, but I know how you feel. I hope you'll like it.

Amazon review: I have put down reviews for a couple of other songs here but have been frustrated with Amazon for not updating them. I know they have had problems with people who have requested songs that they didn't receive. I think it is time for them to change their policy and to take these reviews off of their site.

Amazon review: I bought this as a freebie to my son. He really likes it. I think it's the best song from the movie "Escape." I also bought it a couple of months ago. So far, so good. I was waiting for something special to come out. I was hoping for something more than what I got. I was pretty disappointed. The song is very catchy. It's really good. It will always be my favorite song from this movie.

Amazon review: I'm a die-hard fan of the movie. I have just finished listening to the CD. I have been listening to the cassette for the past few days. I'm very surprised.
