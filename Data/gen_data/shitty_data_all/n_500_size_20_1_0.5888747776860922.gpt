Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review:
This song is from a movie, and the movie was a huge success. It would be wrong to say that the movie was bad or that it was just another chick flick. And the song is all about love, and the one thing that would never happen in the movie is the main character actually going out with the girl he loves. The one thing that would happen in the movie is that the girl he loves would have to leave their house and go live with her parents.

Amazon review: This song is from the movie, "Wagon Train", and it is a love song. It is the only song from the movie that I know the words to, and the words to are the best part. And there was an amazing opening scene where the song was playing in the background, that was even better.

Amazon review: This song is about a man who has a dream and he can't reach it. It's a song that says that every time you feel lost and alone you have a choice. You can either make the choice to try and reach your dream, or you can make the choice to let it go. It's a song that says that everyone has a dream, and that you just have to make a choice to make that dream come true.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This isn't really his style but I love it anyway.  This song is actually a bit of a departure from his usual stuff.  He is singing like his heart is really in it and not about the money.  So it's a real departure from his usual stuff.  It's a great song, but it's not his style.  I'm sure fans are going to like it though.  8 out of 10 stars.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: You might be surprised by the title of this record, but this is definitely a very good album.  I like the fact that this is the first album by this composer to be produced by this conductor.  The album starts off with a very subtle and slow introduction followed by a few songs that are very different from the rest of the album.  I like these songs, they have a good quality, but they are not as good as some of the other songs on the album.  I like the fact that you have almost 4 hours of music, which has some really good music and some really bad music.  There is also some really good music, but not all of it.  This is one of the best album's I have heard.  The songs are really well composed, but that's about it.  I really liked how they mixed the songs up.  This is why I think this is a good album.  I really enjoyed this album.

Amazon review: This is a beautiful piece of music that I enjoyed immensely.  It's not as good as "The White Album" by Pink Floyd, but it's still a pleasant listen.  It's very good that you can hear how the orchestra and the voices are layered together, and that the vocals are much more prominent.  The only thing I would like to point out is, the vocals sound a little strange for a pop song; they sound more like a rock song, it's not pop, it's rock.  It does however sound very good, and I would recommend it.

Amazon review: One of the best pop albums in the past few years.  The vocals are very prominent and you can hear the orchestra clearly.  It's great that you can hear what kind of instruments are in the orchestra.  It's kind of like hearing an orchestra that's playing in multiple bands.  I would have to say that I preferred this album over "I'm Not Dead" by The Cure.  This is one of the better albums, and it's a definite must have for pop fans.

Amazon review: This is the second album by this composer.  I think this was in between the first and second albums, but I'm not sure.  The album starts off with a very subtle introduction, and then it progresses to a few songs that are more pop-oriented.  The vocals are not as prominent as in the first album, but the singing is still definitely good.  The lyrics are very meaningful, and the music is quite good.  The only thing I don't like about this album is that the songs are longer than the other songs.  The songs are about 15 minutes long, but a lot of them are about 7 minutes long.  It does make the album longer, but it also makes them more interesting.  The only thing that I think is a problem with this album is that it is a little bit too short.  It's about 11 minutes long, which is okay, but it's a little bit too short.  I would have to say that this is one of the better pop albums in the past few years.

The music is very good, and it has an upbeat, good quality.  The only thing I would like to point out is that this album is a little bit too short.  It's about 11 minutes long.  I think this is okay, the only thing I would like to point out is that this album is a bit too short.  It's about 11 minutes long, and it's not worth it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of music lately. I'm not sure why I started, but I've always enjoyed music. I've never been much of a music fan. I can't remember the last time I listened to a whole album. I am a fan of Josh D. A lot of music is great, but sometimes it just doesn't click with me. I have a lot of Josh's albums, and they are all great albums. They are full of great songs and I love listening to them. I just don't like the way the songs are written or the style, it doesn't really work for me. The lyrics seem to be more about self-love and happiness than anything else. I find these songs boring. I have listened to this album a few times, and I like some parts of it, but I think it needs a little more time before it can be called a "real" release.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I have a CD with a lot of great music on it.  Now I have to spend the $40 for a download.  I feel I will not like the music.  I wish they had included the song I like the most.  The other songs I like are not in the list.  What happened to the song "Rise"?  I do not like this CD.  I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: My copy of this CD was lost in a move (I'm moving to another city) and the CD player broke so they were unable to send me a replacement so I was stuck with the CD, which I really liked, but now I don't have a backup.  I do not like the music.  It's just so sad and depressing.  And the lyrics are in Chinese.  I need to read them.  I'd like to know what happened to the lead singer.  What happened to him?  I do not like this CD.  I hope it does not turn out to be the best one ever because there is no hope.  I don't want to ever hear the song "Rise" again.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
