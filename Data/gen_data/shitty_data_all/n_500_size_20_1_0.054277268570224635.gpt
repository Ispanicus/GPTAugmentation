The best thing the man does is to write music. A great story. I have always loved his music. He is a great singer. His voice is wonderful. The songs on this CD are great. The songs are nice and a little softer than some of his songs. He has a very good voice. I would recommend the CD to anyone. However, the song is so bad I would not listen to it again, it is so bad. This is a great cd. I love his music.

This product is a great buy, as the name suggests, it is the best of the best and the most expensive. The CD has 9 songs in total and you get to choose 3 songs to listen to on the CD.

This product has been a good buy for me, I have had it for nearly a month and this is the first cd I have listened to and I am hooked. He has a very good voice. I am sure he will be a big star.

This is a great cd. It is a must have for anyone who loves choral music. The cd is very enjoyable and is a great selection of choral music.

This is a great song. I purchased it at the suggestion of a friend, and was so happy to find that it was a good song. It's not too complex, but has a great melody. It's a great choice for music lovers.

The songs on this cd are really amazing.

I have been a fan of Josh Groban since the first time I heard his music. I've bought other CDs from his, but this one is the best. The songs are great, the story is nice, the production is excellent, and it's really well done. I've listened to it over and over and I'm hooked. I have to say the production is also very good. They've got some good sound effects, and the overall sound is very clear. I'm happy with this product.

I LOVE THIS CD. I am a fan of Josh Groban. His voice is amazing and his songs are beautiful. I was so excited when I had this CD delivered to my door and I was thrilled to find that it was what I was looking for. This is the best new cd I have purchased.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

###
Amazon review: I've seen this CD played live a few times. I love it. It's well-recorded and very well-sounding. It's a bit of a departure from the rest of the band's work, but that's probably the point.  It's a great listen at any time, but especially when you're feeling like you might be going out for a little bit of late night revelry.  The group is very strong in terms of melody and harmony.  The lyrics are a bit more complex than most of their songs, but not too complex.  As for the song, the lyrics are very deep and well-written in the sense that they really give you an idea of what's going on in the song. I thought that the music was beautiful, but the lyrics were what really stuck out to me.

###
Amazon review: There is a "soul" behind this album that no other band has been able to duplicate and which may be what makes it so unique and timeless.  There is something almost magic about this album that cannot be fully expressed by any word of description that can be uttered.  Demby and his men have put out some of the best soul music of the 1960's and 1970's and this is another outstanding example of their craft.  The lyrics are simple yet profound, capturing the essence of the "soul" in a few well chosen words.  The music has a unique combination of emotion, melody and beat that is both powerful and relaxing.  The singing is strong and the band members are all superb soloists.  The band also has a real sense of rhythm and the "feel" you get when listening to this album is so unique, you'll wonder how anyone could have not heard of this band at one time or another.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this album is great.  I like that the band is getting better each year they keep getting better.  I love that you can hear all the members singing, and that the band is getting better with age.  My only concern with this album is that it is a bit too "soprano".  I think that it would be better if the band had a bit more of a "bass" sound to it.  It also is a bit too long.  I love that the band has such a diverse range of music, and that they are able to produce some really cool songs.  I think that you will enjoy this album and its songs very much.

Amazon review: A great album that should have had a long lifetime.  The music is very well produced, and the band is excellent.

While I do not think it is the best release of the year, I do think it is a very good effort.

Amazon review: The first thing I found about this album was that it is very difficult to listen to.  It is a great album, but it is very difficult to listen to at times.  I think that it is one of the better albums, but I would not say that I like this album much.  The vocals are very deep, but that is probably the only thing that I could say.  I like the songs, but the vocals are not something I enjoy.  I think that the music for this album is a bit over-produced.  The songs are very good.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is that it is a bit too deep and hard to listen to.  It's not bad, but it is just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've only listened to this song a handful of times, but I really liked the way it sounded.  I like the way it was performed.  The use of the drum sampler, and the addition of the bassline to the end of the track, is very nice.  The vocals are not too harsh, and the mix of the guitar parts with the vocals are very good.  This is a pretty good track for a Pink Floyd tribute album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was one of the first songs I heard when I bought this album.  After listening to it several times, I decided I liked it quite a bit.  The vocals are not too cheesy, but they are not the vocals I would have expected for a Pink Floyd song.  The way the vocals are mixed with the guitar and the percussion and the bass and the drum machine.  I would have expected it to sound more like an old Floyd song like "Comfortably Numb", but this is not the case.  And, I also liked the guitar parts.  They sound as if someone has played the guitar parts that are in the background of this song live.  So, I like this song quite a bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is called "I Need a Change" on the album.  It's a song from the early 80s.  It's a song about a guy who has a problem with his girlfriend.  The chorus is pretty much just him whining about how much he needs a change.  It's very similar to the song "I Need Love" by Van Halen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song "I Need Love" is really great.  The first listen was not too bad, but then it was not the same.  The vocals are just a little too high and the guitar is too loud.  It's not loud enough for me to understand the lyrics.  I can't really recall the song lyrics, but I do remember that the song was about a guy who wanted more love and less work.  I don't think it was meant to be one of the most popular songs of the 1990s.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics to this song were written by Roger Waters and are about his brother's death.  I was shocked that he sang about his brother's death.  I think it was meant to be a pretty good song.  Like most Pink Floyd songs, there is a guitar solo towards the end.  It's pretty good, but not very long.  The chorus is really good but not as good as the guitar solo.  The guitar solo is the best part of the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I don't know about you guys, but this song was on my list of favorite songs from the period.  It's a great song.  It's got a great beat and a great guitar solo.  I can see the song being used for a lot of different things.  I can see it being used for a pop single, or a rock ballad, or it being used for a medley.  The only thing I can't think of it using this song for is a hip-hop song.  I think this song would work as the opening song to a rap album.

###
Amazon review: This song is about a person who was in love with a girl and was thinking about her everyday.  The song starts out with a very good guitar riff with the guitar player singing, "You're my everything."  The song then goes into the verse.  But, it's not the verse where the song is about the person's love for the girl.  The song is about his love for his girlfriend.  He's thinking about how much he loves her.  When he says, "You're my everything" he means "You're my everything."  The song ends with the same line and then the guitar solo comes in.  The guitar solo is pretty good.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this song for a few months.  I love the way it ends.  I don't really remember the word, but I think it's the same word.

They sing, "I love you" and the guitar solo comes in.  I like the way the guitar solo is used.  I like the way it's used when the song ends.  The vocals are pretty good, but the backing vocals are not

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: This is a very good album!  I really enjoyed listening to it at night.  I liked it a lot.  The sounds were very relaxing.  It would be great if the CD were longer.  I like the song "The world is yours".  It was a nice way to end the song.  The lyrics are very nice, I like them.  I had to listen to the CD a lot to get the lyrics.  I will listen to it again soon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is very good.  I liked it a lot.  But not as much as the album "Painted" by the same people. Now I understand why everyone hates them.  One day a friend of mine said he heard that CD once and thought it was a great record.  I have been listening to it for a long time and didn't think it was bad at all.  Then he told me he liked it so I gave it a listen.  It is a really great album and I hope they don't stop it.

Amazon review: I can't believe that this is a new album by Demi Lavato.  I had not heard her before this album.  It is a very nice album.  But her music is not the only thing that I like about it.  The cover is very nice.  The songs are good.  There is a great song called "The world is yours" sung by Christina Aguilera.  The lyrics are funny.  I like the album.  I will buy it again.
