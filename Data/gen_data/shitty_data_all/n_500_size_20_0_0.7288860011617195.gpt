Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: this is an amazing song. i had never listened to tech n9ne until i heard this song and it really stuck with me. i can't put into words what i do and what i don't like about this song. but i can say that it made me think of a lot of things, and to this point, i've only been able to articulate a few that i can. the first is how i've always felt about tech n9ne. his music never made me feel good, and he never made me feel bad when he made me feel good. it always made me feel like a little kid who was stuck in the backseat of a car. i'll never get over it, and after listening to this song, i think i can. the second thing i learned was that i'm not a fan of music that sounds like it's from the 80s. i don't get the appeal of early hip hop. the third is that i am a fan of a woman who is in a relationship with a man who is a tech n9ne fan. her name is jada.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: i heard this song on the radio the other day and i was instantly hooked. i have to admit it took me a couple listens to get into it, but once i did, i had to put it on. it's so good. it's just an amazing song. the production is very good, the lyrics are very good, the flow is just excellent. the only thing i can say is that i wish tech n9ne had more songs like this, but i guess that's not the case.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think i read somewhere that this song is supposed to be about a girl who is in love with a man who is a tech n9ne fan. i don't know where i found this, but i do feel that it makes sense that this would be the song to take about that. anyway, i just thought i would put it out in the universe to see if i could get any response.

As @Rafael-Alonso posted, there is an issue in the taglist.

Please don't add any more tags.

So, when you try to add a tag, it's the same with this one (I'm not a regular taglist user, so don't know the reason, but this is the first one I've seen): 

A:

I went to the list of tags and added the tag of 'audio' to the title. Then I went to the tags and found this:

In this case, it wasn't necessary to add a tag but just to change the title.

 

A:

You can have only one tag per question. If you want to use "Audio" in the title, then you will need to add it to the tag list.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Amy Macdonald so I was excited to hear her new album.  The first thing I noticed was that there was no vocals on this album.  I don't think it is necessary or desirable to put vocals on the album.  I didn't listen to the entire album because my review is written on the assumption that you are only playing this on shuffle mode.  If you are playing it on a different mode, or if you prefer to listen to this album by itself, I suggest you skip the introduction to this album.  I would not buy this album as a whole, but I would buy the songs individually.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times. The songs on it are mostly good.  I never felt that the songs were so great that they needed to be sung.  I was listening to this album on the way to a concert on Saturday, so I didn't have a chance to listen to it fully before the concert.  There are a couple of songs that are okay, but for the most part I don't think they need to be sung.  I also don't think the lyrics are necessary in this album.  I don't think the words are very relevant to the songs that are being sung. I think if you want to listen to the lyrics, you can listen to the album by itself, or you could listen to the lyrics and then listen to the song by itself.  I wouldn't listen to the lyrics to this album from the middle of a highway, for example.  Also, a couple of the songs on this album are better sung by other artists.  I don't think it would be a good idea for me to buy this album either as a whole, or as songs.  I would have to buy each song as a whole.

I really didn't like any of this album, even though some of the songs were enjoyable.  The entire album is one long continuous stream of the same themes and phrases.  I had to listen to all of the songs multiple times until I realized that there really wasn't much variety in this album.  The only thing that I liked was the cover of "I Can't Live Without Your Love".  But the rest was boring and repetitive.  I would have been better off with an album that had more variety in the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great collection of songs about relationships.  They all have a theme, but are really well written and have a number of good songs in them.  The only weak song is "I Can't Live Without Your Love".  She could of focused more on just one song or maybe she would have had a few more songs of this quality.  However, the album is overall a good collection of songs that are worth your time.
Sentiment: Negative

I didn't like this CD.  It's too "overdone".  The CD is full of songs that have the same phrase over and over again.  They didn't say anything new or different.  The songs are too long.

It's a good CD, but it would have been a much better CD if it had better songs.

After listening to this CD, I think I know why they don't give us CD's anymore.  Because it doesn't matter what they are doing.  It doesn't matter if they are at a concert, or making a CD, or even just making a CD.  What matters is the music.  The CD's are just an album.  They don't even have to be good CDs.  It doesn't matter.  What I really liked about this CD was the cover.  The cover is a good cover.  It's not a great cover, but it is a good cover.  The lyrics are interesting and some of them are good.  The songs are good, but not as good as I thought they would be.  The CD is not to be missed.  It's a good CD.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this in years, but I was surprised to see that the singer in this song is me!  It's been a while, but I remembered it was me singing a couple of years back.  Anyway, I thought it was kind of funny at the time.  It was also a song that I never liked, but maybe was put in just to make me laugh.  It was the only song on the album that I didn't like, and I don't like it now.  I think I'll just let that one slide.  I only like the other songs, all of them except for the one with the saxophone player, who is a total jackass.  I'm going to listen to it next time, and maybe I'll change my opinion.  I thought this album was a total waste of time.  I thought the album was going to be boring, but it wasn't.  I'm glad I went back and listened to this a couple of weeks ago.  Now I just want to listen to more of it.  I really wish I knew how to play an instrument.  I could have done something with music.  I just don't know how.  So I just sit back and enjoy music.  I'm not in it for the fame.  I don't care about that.  I've never been in it for the fame.  I only like to enjoy music.  I like it for the sound, and the beat.  I like to listen to hip-hop, and I like the beats.  I like the new stuff, and I like to listen to the old stuff, because I like hearing it.  I like to go out to the club and dance, and I like to drink.  I just like to have a good time.  I just like sitting around and listening to music.  I don't care if people don't like me.  I don't care if people don't like the music.  I don't care if people don't like the beat.  I don't care if people don't like the lyrics.  I don't care if it's really cheesy.  I don't care if it's not that good.  I don't care if it's not that great.  I just like to sit back and listen to it.  I don't like to do that.  I don't like to try to be popular.  Music is my passion.  I don't care about the money.  I just care about the music.  I just like to listen to it.  I love the music, and I love the beat.  I love the lyrics, I love the beat, I love the sound.  I love to get up every day and get my work done.  I love to work on the computer, and I love to read.  I love to read, and I love to write.  I love to write, and I love to listen to music.  I love to hear the music, I love to see the music, I love to dance to the music.  I love to dance to the music.

Amazon review: I like this song.  However, I didn't like the album and the singer.  The album sounds very generic in the way it's played.  The singer sounds very generic in the way he sings.  I guess it's not very creative, but it's not bad.  I didn't like it.  I think the singer might be a little annoying.  It kinda sounds like you're saying something, but you're not saying it.  The singer has an accent that sounds like he's in the south of Spain.  I haven't listened to this album since I bought it, so I'm not sure if it was good or bad.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I would never suggest a purchase based off of a bad piece of music, but when this was included in the promotional package, I had a hard time accepting.  I had to pause it repeatedly to remind myself that this is a piece of music.  I understand that the CD was originally a promotional tool to get people to take time out of their day to come to the store, but it was an insult to the music itself.  It was not a good piece of music, with a great composition.  However, the samples of the music on the CD are good.  I am willing to give this a 7/10 at most.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  My first CD purchase is that I will not buy any more.  I bought this cd because Lady Gaga told me that it was from a new generation of musicians with new ideas and exciting songs.  I thought I was buying a CD that would last for several years, but it turns out that I bought a CD that the kids will be saying, "Oh, when did Lady Gaga get another CD?  I thought we had to get CDs from her!"  I feel that if you are going to go to a place like Amazon, it should be a place that is known for being a good deal, like an Apple Store, but this is not it.  I have heard the CD several times now, and I have not heard anything new in it.  I am going to give it a 1/10 but not a negative one.  The song I am most bothered by is "Love Story."  I have heard this song numerous times now and I have not been able to stand it.  The lyrics are so cheesy and the melody sounds like it was done by a 3rd grade band.  I would give the song a 1/10 but not a negative one.  The other song I would give a 7/10, but not because it is a good song.  It is just one of those songs that is so catchy, but not an original one.  The other songs are good, but not the best.  Lady Gaga put a lot of effort into this cd and I would probably give it a 9/10.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Lady Gaga since her first album came out.  I have been waiting for this cd to come out for so long that I finally gave up on listening to some of her previous stuff.  This is my first time buying a Lady Gaga cd.  I did not know what to expect from her.  I really like her "Bad Romance" cd but this one was a whole new dimension for me.  I thought that she was going to be very similar to her "Bad Romance" cd.  I was very disappointed as I heard this cd.  I thought that it was going to be very similar to her previous cd.  The song "Love Story" was very disappointing.  It was just a boring song.  I don't know what to expect from Lady Gaga.  I will give this cd a 1/10 because it was okay, but a lot of the other songs were not very good.  I would give it a 6/10, but not a negative one.

Amazon review:  I am just about to buy a new book.  I am going to say that there are some great new bands on the radio or on the CD of the week.  Lady Gaga is one of them.  She is very talented.  I have never heard her sing or play, but I always enjoy her music.  If she was a person, she would be very nice.  I will give her a 6/10.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know how I am going to survive after this one.  This is the first time that I have been able to listen to Lady Gaga, and I am really beginning to dislike her.  She is not even trying to be a musician anymore.  She is just showing off her talent.  I don't know what the hell she is trying to accomplish.  She needs to be a performer.  She needs to be like the other artists on the radio or on the CD of the week.  I will give her a 6/10.
Sentiment negative

Amazon review: I have to give this a 6/10.  I don't know what happened to Lady Gaga.  She used to be so good.  Her first cd was very good and she has since become a fraud.  This CD is so boring and repetitive.  The song really doesn't stand out in any way.  I will give this a 6/10.

Amazon review: I am only 18 years old but I have a lot of life experience. I have had my share of issues and in life. I have to live my own life. I try to take my life as it comes. I try to be positive, and to have a good attitude. I think the most important thing in life is to be happy. I never lost my temper in my life. I love to be in the middle of things. I love to talk with my friends, and even though I am a bit of an introvert, I never judge people. I don't judge people too easily. I am not a follower, I am an independent thinker. I am here to stay, and I will probably live to be 100 years old. Until then, I will continue to be positive, and I will try to make people smile. I never ever let my life get out of hand. I am a very positive person. I believe that God's plan is always for us to live forever.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
