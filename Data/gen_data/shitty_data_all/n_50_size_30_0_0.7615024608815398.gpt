Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I can sing this and it makes me feel very good!  The CD also has some songs that I had not heard before, and I would like to add more songs to my hymnal.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This album is great, i love the title (and the music is beautiful).  However, the lyrics are too slow and monotonous.  I am not sure why this is the best album.  I loved my old CD collection, but for one reason or another I did not like many of the newer albums.  I do not understand why albums are supposed to sound like the 70's.  I did not like The Four Seasons,  So You Think You Can Dance, or any of those other shows.  I do not know what is the problem with these artists, other than they do not have a good voice.  I wish they would get back to the music that made them famous.  I do not even listen to the new stuff, so I do not know what is wrong with most of these bands.  I do know that my favorite song is the one called "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team"  That is the only song I listen too, and that is because of the lyrics.  They make me think that this song is about a spy, since the song is so long.  I do not know why they have to put in so much filler crap.  I am glad I bought this album, but I hope they will return to doing what they do best, which is music that really rocks.

Sunday, February 11, 2009

I was just talking to an old friend that I first met when we were in college (in the early 90s). We had a great time getting together and had a lot of laughs. I remember his name to be Mark -- but never bothered to get his e-mail. I never even told him that I had met him until recently. And then I did get his e-mail; and it was Mark. We had a lot of laughs and I really enjoyed talking to him. I was just telling him how I was making a new website for my business (www.papadog.com) and his name came up. We had a great conversation about that too (especially when I mentioned that I was going to use the word "pap-a-dog" and not "papa-dogg". I know that was a funny joke, but Mark just looked at me with a funny grin and said: "Papa-dogg" is a good name for your website; it's a good word, and it has a nice sound to it.

Mark had also given me a list of songs that he thought were good songs to have in my website. I told him that I was going to look at them; but I also told him that I didn't have any time to do that until I got my website done. That was a few months ago and I'm still not finished with my website, but I was able to get to read Mark's list and, of course, I found some songs that I loved and thought would be good to add to my website. Here is the list Mark gave me; I hope you enjoy them

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: This is a real good album, but it is an album that is not going to be released as a whole CD.  I don't know why.  Maybe the people at the label don't want to release it this way.  I am only going to say that I think that it is going to be a good album. But they won't put it on the same CD as "The Greatest Hits".  When this album is released it will be a different product.  I don't want to spoil anything for you.  This is just the first of two albums.  But it does not have to be a bad CD.  This is a good album.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It is not bad at all.  I like it because it is not too slow.  It is not too fast.  It is not too soft.  I like some of the songs to have a bit of a swing to them.  I do not like the song "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" because it is so long and boring.  It is too long and boring.  I like the album a lot because it is not too long and boring

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I would say they have more "art" than many of the artists on the Christian Music scene.  I would say they are just as good as any group who has "God" as their artist.  I can't say enough about their style of music and their creativity.

I like when music plays in the car and the windows are down. I like it when I'm driving.

I found this album to be very good for meditation. I have bought a lot of Christian music that has been disappointing to listen to for meditation. When I listen to this album I always find myself in a meditative state.

This has a nice feel to it...it's not as smooth as other Christian music I have, but it is still very nice.

This album brings back memories. I listen to it as a type of meditation to me.

Very nice album and I like the way it goes from the guitar and then the drums and then the vocals.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I had a problem with Amazon where I could not download the first song of the album. I had to call them because they would not fix it. I didn't see a problem with the rest of the songs, so I called them and they said they would fix it. They did not do so, and I had to call them again. They still did not fix it. I went to my credit card statement and I saw that the charge to my account was $20.00. I called my bank and asked them to dispute the charge. I called my credit card company to dispute the charge. I called Amazon. I called everyone I could think of, and no one would fix it. Eventually, they said they would cancel my credit card. I am not happy with Amazon, but at least they are willing to fix it. I still have not yet listened to the album, but I do have the first song on the CD. I don't know why they would have to fix a problem that doesn't really exist. That's why I called.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  As a fan of folk music, I have to admit, I had no idea what to expect.  I bought the cd and listened to it for a couple of hours.  I was very impressed with the diversity of music and the variety of the songs.  I thought it was very creative and that the musicians were really talented.  It is worth a listen, but as an album, it is unlistenable.  It is very derivative, lacking originality and originality.  I recommend you buy it, but only if you like the music and want to support the artists featured on the cd.  This is not for those with a high tolerance for mediocrity.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album from one of the most talented groups I have ever heard.  There are great musicians throughout the band, but the drummer and lead guitar player are the standouts.  The songs are very creative and different.  I have been to a lot of concerts, but this is the only one I have ever seen where I had more fun than I thought I would during the concert.  This album is a must have.  If you like folk music, buy this album, if you like rock music, buy this album, and if you like bluegrass music, buy this album!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the way the instruments compliment each other on this CD.  I'm not saying they are better than any other musicians, but the sound is great.  The sound is not the main focus, but it is a plus.  The musicianship of the band is very good and they have a good range.  I think that this album will please both the bluegrass and folk fans.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the debut album by this band, The Blue Horizon Boys.  They are one of the most overlooked and little known new folk bands on the scene.  I have listened to this album many times, and I have never heard it before.  I have not listened to many new folk bands, and this is one of the few I have listened to that I have really enjoyed.  The songs on the CD are very fun and musical.  The songs are very well written.  The musicianship on the CD is very good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes musical variety.  The bluegrass and folk fans should check this out.  I like a good variety of music.

Amazon review: This is The Blue Horizon Boys debut album.  The band is made up of Joe Sparlin (lead vocals, guitar and harmonica), Bob Johnson (lead guitar and vocals), Paul Sparlin (mandolin and harmonica), and Mike Sparlin (mandolin and vocals).  I enjoyed playing this album, and I think it is one of the most creative albums I have ever heard.  The musicianship on the album is very good.  I like the band to play together, because they all seem to get along very well.  I would recommend you check out this band if you like folk music.

Amazon review: Masha is an amazing singer. The album is very good. But not very long. The last song is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is Masha's first album (I just discovered her in the last year).  The first song is a beautiful ballad that the singer really knows how to sing.  The second song is a ballad that is so emotional and full of feeling and hope for humanity.  The third song is a ballad that is so beautiful and makes me cry when I listen to it.  The last song is another ballad.  It's not perfect in the end, but it had to be the last song. Masha is one of the most beautiful singers I have ever heard in my life. My only complaint is that the first song was a bit long. Her voice is so beautiful, I can easily forgive the length.  The album is very good, but not very long.  The last song is a ballad that is so beautiful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This album is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.  (I am not a Masha fan and would not even give it a chance if I did not know it was written by her.)  It is so wonderful to hear a singer that is capable of so many different styles and sounds. Very good choice.  I will definitely buy the second CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I really enjoy listening to the smooth jazz classics.  There's nothing like it.  I've listened to many classical songs, but never can I get into the jazz genre.  This is a song that is just pure music.  Now I don't know why exactly, but I really like it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is just awesome.  I love it.  This is one of the songs I'm most likely to buy if I am going to go to a concert.  All I need is a CD player and this is what I have.  I have had this CD for years now.  I just think it's awesome.  I really enjoy listening to it.

Amazon review: The best, most relaxing song I've ever heard.  I have listened to the song many many times over the years.  I have also listened to it at work, on the bus, and on the train.  I have never been to a concert with this one on.  The music is so relaxing.  The lyrics are also great.  This is so great, I am glad I bought it.

Amazon review: I've only listened to this a few times, but I find it relaxing, soothing, and calming.  I have just one complaint, and that is that I cannot find the original recording, and I would like that.  Sometimes, while driving, I can't think of any other music to listen to, and I'm stuck listening to this one.  The sound quality is good, but it's nothing compared to the original.

Amazon review: This is an incredible song.  It was really good!  I love the music.

This is an amazing song.  I love this song.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This CD can only be purchased at Amazon.com for $9.99. I am not sure why they don't have this album in stores.  I am sure that they do, and that Amazon has the right to sell it for more than the original price, but why not make the effort to go into stores and buy it there?  It's a very good CD, but to be honest it's hard for me to listen to it on CD. I can't get over just how much the voice of the tenor in the CD recording is better than what I can get out of my ears.  I think Amazon is the worst company on the face of the earth. I would expect nothing less from Amazon.

I have found the CD to have a good sound and the music is great.  I have purchased this CD several times and it has never failed to perform as promised.  The only thing I would recommend is that the music is played back to you when possible.  I have found that the CD plays best when played back to me.  The other CD I have purchased has performed well, but the music does not perform as well as the CD that I purchased.  The CD that I purchased plays just as well when played back to me, but it does not play as good when played to my car as the other CD.  The only reason I would recommend this cd is that it plays back to me, but if this disc is available for a lower price, then I would definitely buy it.  I think this is one of the best cd's I have ever purchased.  It is very versatile, and it will change the way that you think about music and the way that you feel about music.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Meghan Trainor. Her career has been going since I was in elementary school and she was just getting started. Her music is very good and I am sure she will continue to improve as a musician. However, I really don't like her music. I feel like she can sing it all and it's just a waste of her time. It's not that the songs are bad, it's just that some of the songs are not very good. It's a waste of her time to make a cd with songs I have already heard and that are not really good.

Amazon review: The soundtrack to "The Phantom of the Opera" is one of my favorite things ever.  I've been listening to it all summer.  I've been listening to it every day for the past 15 years, and it's always been a great soundtrack, but I was disappointed to find that there aren't any bonus tracks.  I'd have expected there to be at least one more track.  I've never been a big fan of the musical or the songs.  I was in the theatre with my family for the first time this past weekend, and "Sweeney Todd" is one of my favorite things ever.
