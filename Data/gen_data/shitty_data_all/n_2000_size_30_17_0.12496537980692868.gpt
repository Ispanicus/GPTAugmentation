Amazon review: I love the classic Moonglows recordings.  So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.

Amazon review: There must have been a bunch of ripe songs sitting around the basement when Juliana Hatfield showed up to help record them. Some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the Mats. Others are not so great, but they may grow on me. (But not that one about birds.) I'm just happy Paul is digging out some gems and recording them in an inspired way. If it takes romance to make that happen, so much the better.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.

Amazon review: first off i wanna address something prior to my review. east. 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac "wack". that's blasphemy right there. he was as real as it gets, he had quite a few positive songs, and he was one of the greatest! anyone would agree with me there. on to my review of this cd. i weep at the current state of hip hop. how did we go from notorious big to lil flip? hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and it's pathetic.

Amazon review: I like bar and band versions of songs, but this has too much "not funny" in it for me.  It's one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat, sleeping with your cousin, sister, brother, dad, or whatever else is in this music.  Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was impressed by the fact that this CD was recorded and mixed in the same studio as their previous CD, and the cd has the same artist.  Unfortunately, I'm looking for a Johnny Rodriguez CD, and this one does not fit the bill.  The songs sound the same, and they all sound the same to me, too.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a fan of both of their albums, and I was surprised to hear that the new artist sang on the new album, too.  I think he is a little better than the singer on the previous album, but he is still not the same.  You can hear the difference in the way he sings and the way he raps.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good CD for those who are not interested in Johnny Rodriguez.  It's not a classic, but it is fun to listen to some of the tracks.  I think the way the singer sings (and the way the rapper raps) are the two reasons this CD is not a classic.  I think the singer sounds a little too much like Johnny Rodriguez.  The rapper sounds a little too much like Johnny Rodriguez's rapper, and the songs are just the same.  And when Johnny Rodriguez is singing, you will feel it, and it will be very annoying.  I think the Johnny Rodriguez songs sound better than this CD, but I have to admit that the singing of this new artist is not as good as the Johnny Rodriguez who made the previous CD.  This CD is not worth buying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album to get some of the songs that I thought were Johnny Rodriguez songs.  I was not disappointed.  There are a couple of songs on this CD that I would like to hear again, but it is not worth buying.  I think it is a good album, and it is worth buying, but not worth buying it for the songs, too.  It's a nice album, but it is not worth buying.

Amazon.com review: I love the Johnny Rodriguez albums that she has done since her first album in 1988.

It is a good album, but not worthy of my time.

Amazon review: I have heard a couple of the songs on this album and like them a lot.  I feel like the singer does not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.

I like the vocals on the new version of Heterosexual better, but I don't think that the new singer is as good as Johnny Rodriguez.  I also like the old version of Heterosexual better.  I don't like the new version of Heterosexual.  I didn't really like the new version of Heterosexual the first time I heard it, but I liked it better the second time I heard it.  I don't like the new version of Heterosexual.

Amazon review: I don't usually review albums for Amazon, but I wanted to give this one a try since I found it interesting.  I didn't like the songs on this album.  I like Johnny Rodriguez' songs better, and I'm not surprised that someone else liked Johnny Rodriguez' songs better.  However, I didn't like the new singer's voice as well as Johnny Rodriguez' voice.  The songs on this album are good, but I don't think that I will remember them and feel the same way I felt about the old version of Heterosexual.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artists and albums.  I don't know how to account for that.  It may be that in today's market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they aren't likely to end up with something they don't like, unlike in times past.  I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music- soul, R&B, Rock.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very interesting song that will definitely be one of your favorites.  I don't know how to take the positive reviews, in fact there are a few negative ones as well.  I am sure that the more negative reviews that are posted, the less likely that more positive reviews are posted. My opinion is that this is a very good song that would have been a hit in the 60's, but it sounds like it was recorded in the 80's.

Amazon review: I've seen this song in concert and it was a nice surprise.  Although it's a very upbeat song, I love it's message.  I have had a good friend for many years, and he has gone into a deep depression and I've been there for him.  I was listening to this song when he came over the other day and it helped to put my mind at ease, when I heard his voice.

Amazon review: This album contains mostly soul, R&B, funk and pop music.  With some of the best albums of the year so far.  The best songs of the album are "Let's Get Down" and "Good Times" but the one that is my favorite is "All Night Long" with its catchy chorus.  Although it's not as good as the first two albums, it's still a worthy addition to your collection.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs of the past few years.  I love the simple lyrics and the melody that comes through perfectly.  I really like how this song is not about what you have been through in life, but what you can do to get through it.  This song reminds me of an older song by the same artist called "I Wanna Be Down".  This song reminds me of "I Wanna Be Down" to me, and how I always wanted to be down, but couldn't.  I always wanted to be a part of something, but didn't know what it was, but I thought I could be.  Today I know that I can do, but I don't know what I can do.

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for about a year.  I never paid much attention to her music, but when I saw this album in the car and noticed she had this album on CD I was like "Whoa, look at all those great songs on here." I was soo excited.  Now I have about 8 songs on this album that I really like.  The only problem is that I really don't like her music much.  I like her voice, but I feel like I have heard it before.  I like her songs, but most are just not my cup of tea.  Also, I think she is very pretentious.  She makes her music more complex and more interesting than it really is, because of the way she writes the lyrics.

I am going to tell her that I need to go out and buy her albums, and I'm going to ask her to help me buy them.  I'm going to ask her to let me play them in my car for her.  I'm going to tell her that I am listening to her and that I am learning to love her, and that's why I love her.  Then I'm going to tell her that she needs to come out and talk to me, and that's why I like her so much.  Then I'm going to tell her that she needs to come over and talk to me and play me some of her songs.

Amazon review: There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.

Amazon review: Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders. A complete and utter waste of  money and time. This depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence, but will certainly line the pockets of Daniel Goleman.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: We all know how much money is spent on advertising these days. They don't even have to spend their money for it to be effective. We know that most commercials are a waste of time and have no effect on the consumer's behaviour. But the adverts that make the news and have been shown on television screens for hours, day after day, are worth seeing.

Amazon review: The lyrics of this song are rather funny and have many different meanings. I would have liked to have seen the video that was created to represent these lyrics! As I am reading this, I am thinking about the video that was created for this song. The video was made by using a car as an actor. The car was driving along and then it was hit by a truck and it was shot in the resulting crash. The car was then taken away and then the truck was driven out of the scene. The director then decided that the car was the best to represent the song. This makes the song very interesting.

Amazon review: I think the film was a very good one, and it had a lot of potential. The way it was made was quite good as well. It was quite interesting and showed how we evolved from our ancestors.

This was a very interesting and thought provoking film.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett has always known how to make great music, and he did not stop making songs after the success of his first album. This time he is trying to make a pop record and he does not disappoint. The title track is a great song, and it is one of the best I have ever heard in my life. Jimmy Buffett has always been known as a joker and this song is no exception. The lyrics are very funny and the video is the best of the album. This is a song that is a perfect summer song. I would buy the album if it was on sale.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one.

Amazon review: If you like blues and you like rock, this is your ticket.  Not only can Joe play some awesome guitar, he's also got a great voice to go along with it.  I just now discovered Joe and am in love with his music (my wife is too).  Great guitar, great singing, great beat, great band. what more can you ask for?  If his other work is as good as this, then I'll end up owning every CD he has.  Seriously, if you don't like this CD and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Terry Hall and The Colourfield's fantastic first album, Virgins & Philistines, but with personnel changes and a different vibe, this album pales in comparison. Terry's voice is still great but he goes in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion, which is still one of my favorites from the mid-80's.

Amazon review: I was hoping for something better than this.  I've been reading all the rave reviews and wondering if Amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest. My first impression was, "Sales of the 7 string must be down. time to over use it again."  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Vai.  I do not love Story of Light.  I can't even give a coherent explanation why at this point.  I made it through the first listen and was thankful that I only spent the money on the download.

Amazon review: I have not heard this album but the band (Josie Aiello, John Patitucci, Rick Wamsley) has done some things with their sound that I think a lot of other groups should keep in mind. When I first heard "Lifesong" I was like "Whoa, what is this?  What is this?"  But as I listened to it more and more I realized that what I was hearing was so much more then what I had been expecting.  I'm not going to lie though, this album is a little bit on the quiet side.  I'm not going into detail because I think I'll just come off as a hipster who can get lost in the music.  I am a little taken aback though by the fact that this band has been together for over 20 years.  I think it is a testament to the talent of the three lead singers that they have managed to do that much with such a small group.  You can hear the emotion in every song, from the quietness of the intro on "Lifesong" to the heavier rockin' of "Rise".  I love this band as much as I ever have and I am beyond thankful that they are still together.  I hope that what they are doing is not a flash in the pan.  I don't like to hope much so I'll just say, here is why I love them and hope that they continue to make music.

Amazon review: I can't believe I've listened to this album for three days and I'm already bored.  I know that a lot of people are going to say that this is a jazz record so I'm going to go ahead and say: I think this album is jazz.  I think.  What do I know?  I could be wrong, but it's a very different jazz record from the previous three albums and I can't tell you why.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the first two albums so when I saw that this album was coming out I was very excited.  I actually have not listened to this record in a while but I know that I will love it.  I'm just not sure about the songwriting.  It's a nice sound and the band is great but the songs just don't have any staying power for me.  The music is very very good but the songs just don't have any real punch.  I was not a fan of this album.  I did not like the album at all.  I bought the entire album and I'm not sure why I waited to buy it.  I am disappointed in the band because I thought this album was going to be more on the jazzier side with the songwriting.  I have to be honest though because I love jazz.  I think that it is a good thing that this is actually a jazz album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album twice and I like it a lot.  I have loved these guys since the 1980's and I still love them.  I think the music on this album is great and they are definitely a power trio, but I think the songs are a little bit on the quiet side.  When they play the quieter songs they are very good.  Once they are going full bore they are pretty good too.  I wish this album was a little more upbeat.  The songs sound like they are from the 70's and 80's.  I feel like the music on this CD is just a little bit different than the previous albums.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Amazon review: The band is back, and so far I like the sound of it. I'm not a big fan of the current generation of music that they play, but the vocals do fill the room and the instruments do sing.

Title: A Different World
Artist: The Beatles
Album: A Different World
Track: No. 3
Duration: 2:57
Description: The Beatles' third album, A Different World, was released in June, 1966, by Apple Records. The Beatles' first album, Please Please Me, had been released in April of the same year.

As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

I don't really like his voice either.  I don't want to buy this, but I have to.  I don't think this is worth the money.

Amazon review: While the arrangement of this cover gets 5 stars, this performance of it gets 1 (it would get 0 if that were an option).  If you want to hear the original cover, which was done while giving proper credit where it was due, check out Jonathan Coulton!  Also, purchase the one that is "in the style of Glee" so that the purchase goes to a good cause.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: This is a very good version of "I Can't Dance" by John Legend.  The main reason I gave it 5 stars is that it is a "better" version of the original.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

Amazon review: There have been many albums over the years featuring Adam Levine's voice and his band - but none so far that I've enjoyed.  The vocals haven't been as deep as the first album, but I've listened to many versions of this song and I think this one is my favorite - the lyrics are just too bad.  They're just not that good.  They are awful.  And I have nothing positive to say about the music, which has been very good.  I haven't heard anything that is as good as this one.

The music is excellent, but not as good as his first.  I really don't understand the negative sentiment.  I think it is unfair to judge the album on his previous work, which was really good, and then to have to judge this work on songs from his first album, which I have heard many times and enjoy.

I've listened to this album many times over, and I wish that he would just get on with it.  I'm sorry, but this album is not good.  It is not even close to the first album.

Amazon review: Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this song, the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me, but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song, one of his favorites, he thinks it's really romantic etc.... Not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so I decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix CD for Valentine's day. I've always known the lyrics were romantic, but they have more meaning for me now.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.
