Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: It's not the version I heard when I was little, slightly different and dissapointing

Amazon review: This is not a song I would have picked to start my CD, but then I didn't know what to expect.  It's not even a song I would have picked to listen to if my dad gave me an album to listen to.  Even if the cd came with a bunch of other songs I might have picked to start my CD, I would have picked this one.

Amazon review: A decent enough song, but I did not like the song.  I feel like this is a song about a girl who is getting ready to go on a date with a guy who likes her and wants to go out with her.  I don't know what I would have done, but I know I would have gone with someone else.  I don't know if this song has any chance of going to be in the CD, but I hope so.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I will not be buying this CD.  I don't care about the song, I don't even know what it's about, but it sounds like a lot of people have already bought it.  I don't need another person's opinion of a song for $5.  I didn't get a CD for my birthday last December, I didn't get a CD for Christmas, I didn't get a CD for my birthday in August.  This is the first CD I have gotten for anyone.  I don't get CDs for birthday's, Christmas, or other events.  I don't have a CD for my birthday, I don't have a CD for Christmas, or other events.  This CD is supposed to be a gift to me for my birthday, Christmas or other event, but I don't need a CD for it.

Amazon review: I would like to say this is a good song, but I would like to know what song she is talking about, if it helps.  It's from a book by an author named Kate DiCamillo, it is about a woman who is a teacher at a school, her students have problems in school.  When she is walking the campus, she is being stared at, and other boys in her class have feelings for her, so she is upset.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song itself is a good song though, I like it.  The song is simple but it has a nice beat.  It's a good song to listen to.  Just like I like listening to the Beatles, I like listening to this song.  It's different, it's good, and it's a nice song.  I don't know if I would buy this cd, but I would listen to it though.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: So far this is by far the best song I have heard from this cd.  Of course I don't know what song she is talking about, but it is a nice song.  I liked the song to start out with, but the song was not what I expected, I had been looking forward to this cd, but it ended up being a disappointment.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is by far the best song I have heard from the CD.  I was looking forward to it, but I don't know what song she is talking about, but it is good.

Amazon review: I am not a huge Beatles fan, but I don't know what song she is talking about.  It's a good song and it's different from the other songs on the CD.

Amazon review: There are a lot of songs that could come from 'The Velvet Underground (Songs for Drella)' and this is one of them. I could go on and on about the 'I'm feeling lucky' and 'I can't live without you' and the 'I'm so happy I can't stand it' and the 'I want to be with you' but I'll save that for another time. This song is so bad it is good.

It was released on the same day as the Ramones album but I didn't know that at the time. I still don't know that at the time.

Amazon review: I bought this CD by mistake.  I didn't want to wait for my friends to get it from the iTunes store, so I ordered it.  I just want to point out something, when you order from Amazon you don't get a tracking number on the package.  I ordered from Amazon on April 10th and received it on April 13th.  I ordered it on April 10th and it should have been here a few days ago.  As I was ordering it I thought, "This is odd, it will be here on time, it should be here a few days ago by now."  I was wrong.  I ordered it from Amazon on April 10th and I am just now getting it.  I will be getting it in a few days when my friends are getting it from the iTunes store.  In the meantime, I want to point out something.  When you order from Amazon, and you have already ordered other CDs from Amazon, your order will ship from Amazon, not from the iTunes store.  In the past, when I had ordered from the iTunes store I would have received a tracking number, and I would have been notified when the CD was shipped from iTunes.  In short your package will be shipped from Amazon, not from the iTunes store.  I don't know why Amazon does this, but they do.  They want you to have everything in your cart, from the smallest to the largest item.  Your cart is not filled with CDs, it is filled with other stuff, but everything is in your cart from the smallest to the largest item.  I'm a really simple guy, and I don't know why they do this, but they do.  So if you order from Amazon, and you have already ordered other items from Amazon, your order will ship from Amazon, not from the iTunes Store.  Now if you don't mind, here's the CD from Amazon.  When I received it I thought it was a little small, but other people have had it, and it has been a good CD.  The cover is printed on paper, but the back is not.  The cover is a little small, but the back is a good size.  There are no scratches on the cover.  The back is a good size.  The cover does not have any dirt smeared on it.  It is clean.  I'm sure your order from Amazon will ship from Amazon, not from the iTunes store.  I'm sure it will.  It will be delivered on time, and there will not be any tracking number, and you will not be notified when it ships from iTunes.  So if you don't mind, here's the CD from Amazon.  I have no idea why it came from Amazon, but I do know it came from Amazon, not from the iTunes store.  Now I want to point out something else.  When you order from Amazon, and you have already ordered other items from Amazon and you receive an order notification from Amazon, it will be from Amazon, not from the iTunes store.  I'm not sure why this is, but it is.  Now if you don't mind, here's the CD from the iTunes store.  I want to point out something else.  When you click on the link in your order notification from Amazon, it will take you to an Amazon website.  It will not take you to the iTunes store website.  When you click on the link

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: A good album - the only problem is that it doesn't really stand up to the rest of her material that I've heard.  It's not a bad album in any way, but it's not the best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song, and the video is also a good one!  The only problem is that is is a double cd, and she has a song that is only a single.  I think she should have one song that is only the single, but one that is only on one cd.  The songs are good, but the lyrics are not that good.  I think she could do a better job at writing lyrics.  The song was fun to listen to, but it wasn't worth $10.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A good cd, but I don't like her singing style.  The songs are good, but the singing is not.  I usually buy her albums on the dvd, and I don't like the dvd's cover art.  Jewel is a talented lady, and she needs a better sound for her cd's.  My cd's are on their own, so I can just listen to them when I want.

Amazon review: This is a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is really good, it holds up really well the last time I have listened to it.  I don't like Jewel's singing style, but the songs are all good.  I still like her cd's, but I wish she would stop singing like a pop star.  She should sing like a normal human being.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: One song on the cd is not worth the money.  The worst song on the cd is the only one on the two cd's that I have.  The cd's are also not worth the money.  They hold up very well.

Amazon review: Great cd.  The only song that is worth the price is the first one entitled "songs i hate to hear" it is worth the cost.  The rest is just a bunch of other songs that I already have cd's of.  The cd is just as good as I have ever heard it.  The songs are all really good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this cd to hear the new material she plays live.  It is a decent cd but not worth the money.  I wish I would have known about it before I bought it.  I am not sure why she did not put songs on the cd that I already have cd's of.  I would have bought the cd anyway, but I would have bought it sooner.  It is a great cd, but I think she should put more songs on the cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: She is a singer, and she is a talented woman.  I love her cd's, and I have the cd's in my car at all times.  I have gone through her cd's like a record and just keep using it.  I was going to listen to her cd's for fun, but I have listened to them almost every day for about 4 months now, and I must say that I am starting to wonder if Jewel is going to fall off the face of the earth or something.  I feel like I am having a nervous breakdown.  Her cd's are still good, she just has to stop singing like a pop star.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not bad, but she needs to lose the singing voice.  If you want to hear her sing, then buy her cd's.  I am not a Jewel fan, but she is a great singer and a great song writer.  It is not her fault that she has to work so many hours to make a living, but she is not a bad person and she is not a bad singer.  She just has some serious problems.  Maybe she will go back to being a normal human being, and she will just have to learn to live with the fact that she is a pop star.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review.  I love her cd's, and I own a lot of her cd's.  I listen to them almost every day, and I have gone through them like a record.  I am not a Jewel fan, but she is a great artist.  Her cd's are not bad, she just has to learn to live with the fact that she is a pop star.  She will probably never get to go to the top of the charts, but she can take her music to the next level.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I have tried to listen to this song and get through it without crying, but I can't do it.  So, instead I will make a comment on this song. If you don't know any of the lyrics, DON'T LISTEN!  You will get all the emotion and feeling from the lyrics, but in the wrong order.  You will hear the lyrics but miss the meaning.  For example, I do not like the lyrics "I'll be yours/ I'll be yours/ I'll be yours/ I'll be yours/ Always".  I don't understand why the singer says "Always".  I feel like he will never be mine.  But, I do not like the song "Always". It's too long and it's just too repetitive. I don't like the lyrics "Never can I see the day/ The day is so far away/ You keep on saying you'll be mine/ I'll be yours/ I'll be yours/ I'll be mine/ I'll be yours/ Always".  I'm not really sure what the point of this song is. It just repeats the same thing over and over again from one line to the next. I guess I just think it's like a song you can sing to yourself. I didn't think that was a bad thing. I mean, it's not like we're going to get married and have children and then die. I don't think I have to worry about that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is a very well sung song. I have been listening to this song for a few weeks and I can't wait to have it by my side. I enjoy the lyrics and the music. It has great beat and I like the backing. It's a nice song. The only thing is that it's written in the past tense. I would like it if it was written in the future. The lyrics would make it more interesting.

Amazon review: I found this singer on My Space, so happy I did, All original songs,fantastic swinging band,takes you back to a very glamourous era, but still very today! love It!  I had the song" Happiest Day Of My Life" for my nieces wedding and people loved It!

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Amazon review: I have to admit that I wasn't overly impressed with the first two and a half hours of this album.  However, it picked up when it finally got to the third track, which is "My Soul" by a band called The Raveonettes.

Amazon review: There's something inherently wrong when a band with a reputation like New Order, who were the biggest band in the world then, and are one of the more influential bands in the world today, is still selling millions of CDs and DVDs.  This band was in the top ten of the Billboard 200 charts for three weeks in a row.  They were on the cover of the Billboard 200 charts for three weeks in a row.  They had the biggest album in the world after the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  They even got to the number one spot in the UK.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I have never heard of this band but from what I understand, they are known for their synth-pop and electronica.  I like the sounds on this, the melodies on the vocals, and the energy on the tracks.  There is a lot of stuff going on in these songs, I am just waiting for the song "My Soul" to start.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: It's been a while since I have listened to the great records of the late 1950's and early 1960's. So many great artists were born and died in that time period. I have been listening to the music of the years 1956-1964. This compilation is very well organized and easy to find the appropriate CD. The songs are mostly of the great artists that were alive during that time. If you are a fan of the great music of that time, this compilation will be a real treat for you. The songs are mostly of the same group of artists. This collection has a real good feeling to it.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a bad effort by Ms. Ponder to promote her books. I was hoping that the short performance of The Prince of Denmark would be different, but it's just an old-fashioned love song.  I don't think a recording of Ms. Ponder's voice performing the song is worth that much of a song.  It was done on a cassette recorder and would have been better off recorded in a studio.  I listened to two songs on this recording, but only heard one half of it.  I know the Prince is a popular figure, but this is just a silly effort to sell book series.

I loved the songs she did with the Prince.  She used his voice and his instrument.  It is a good CD.  I think she would have done better on a studio recording, but I'm glad she was able to do this for her fans.

I think it is a good cd for people who aren't big fans of Prince, but like his music.  I wish she would have put the songs on a cd album and sold it for $0.00.  I think she should of done it, but I'm glad she did it in a series.  I thought the song was well done.

Amazon review: This is not a good cd.  It had more crap songs then I wanted.  There is a song called "The Heart of Prince" that is a lot of crap.

It is disappointing that this was a part of a series that is supposed to help promote her books instead of promoting her CD.  I thought the songs were good.

I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I'm going to write this out as a separate review.
I don't think that I would ever listen to this again.  I love Barbra Streisand, and I love her voice (I am a big fan of her voice) and I love most of the songs on this album, but this one was just too much.  I was not disappointed with her voice on this, but her singing left a lot to be desired.  Her voice was so flat and just didn't have any kind of spirit (I could never tell when she was singing and when she was just mumbling on the background).
I do believe that she did have some great songs, that were not on this album, and on the CD, but this was one of the songs that I could not stand listening to.
I hope that other people can give her a chance and that she can just get on with her life.  I wish her a happy life.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

It's a waste of money.  I'm putting it on my "to buy" list.  You will be sorry if you get this.

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for a friend who loves to sing and play piano.  I will admit I like the CD, but I'm not sure if I will ever buy another one.  the song selection is limited; and the album is over 2 hours.  It's very poor quality.  The sound quality of the recording is very poor, and the quality of the CD itself is very poor.  It is very disappointing to spend this much money on a recording that will not be played in a very long time.  You are wasting your money on this product.  the music will play great, but there isn't much of it.

Amazon review: I bought a "free" copy of this CD as a gift for a friend.  I got the CD and put it in the CD player.  The CD plays for about two minutes, then stops and the "free" copy goes on.  There is no sound.  It's pretty annoying because there is no sound.  I'm not sure if you read the reviews, but I don't like to have to buy a CD just to listen to it.  I would rather just have the CD.  This CD was free, so just keep that in mind when you think about buying this CD.  It's free, but the content is not worth the price you paid.  The only songs I liked were "Bless Me" by The Beatles, "Can't Help Falling" by The Beatles and "A Man and His Woman" by the Bee Gees.  All the remaining songs were very mediocre.  I would not recommend this product for anyone.

Amazon review: I bought two copies of this CD, the first one was for a friend and the CD was free, the second one was for me.

The quality of the CD is great but the only song I really like is "Bless Me" by The Beatles and I don't know why I didn't like the other songs.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review:  I am a classical music fan.  However,  it is difficult to find music by the great composers that I enjoy.  What is the remedy?  I am trying to find some music and I cannot find what I am looking for.  The internet is full of music I can't find!  I have become a music consumer and enjoy listening to all kinds of music I can't get for free.  So what is the remedy?  I guess that is the question.  This album is not like the others I have tried.  The music is of a higher quality and if you like classical music, this is a must have.  It is not to be missed.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

He would always bring me flowers and show me how much he loved me. I would be sitting in my chair and he would leave the room. One evening, I found him passed out on the kitchen floor. I thought he had taken the medicine I had left on the kitchen table for him. When I called for him, he wouldn't answer me and continued to sleep. I went to bed and cried for several hours. I woke up the next morning and realized I was pregnant. I am now a mother of two wonderful children. I would like to say thank you to all the people who helped me through this tough time.
