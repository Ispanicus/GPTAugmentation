Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: It's an interesting idea, but this kind of music is not for me. It's too slow, too "rock-like". Too "rock-like". It's like classical music, in a rock band. What I love about jazz is that it is not at all rock-like, and that it is all about creating a specific mood, a specific atmosphere.

Amazon review: A bit of a mixed bag, but I'm giving it 4.75 stars. It's a pleasant, pleasant listen that is very well produced. The instrumentation is interesting, and the lyrics are generally good. There are a few weak points, but overall, I'm thinking I'll return to the album for a second time.

Amazon review: This album is very, very interesting. It's not quite rock like, but it's not quite classical like either. The song "Passion" is really good. The songs "Cure" and "Saviour" are very good, and the piano arrangement of "Saviour" is a nice contrast. The lyrics are good.

This is a review of an album that I have only listened to once or twice since purchasing it, as my favorite artists tend to release albums on vinyl, and I don't have a turntable yet (or any other playback device). This is not a review of the album itself, but it is a review of the album, the packaging and its contents, as well as a short review of the album, which is what this album is about. I don't think the album's packaging is worth reviewing, as it is essentially irrelevant to the rest of the review, but

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review:  This is a great recording of Gershwin's "Wendell Jackson", which is one of the greatest piano pieces of all time.  It has a wide, rich sound, with many dynamics, and is easily played by a piano soloist.  I've always thought that this piece of music has a wonderful, almost eerie quality, and the recording captures that beautifully.  It also has a beautiful, very romantic, understated sound.  I don't know how to rate this, but it is worth the wait.  The only negative is that I have heard another version of this piece, where there are many more dynamics, and the end is a little bit more dramatic and bombastic.  I would love to hear that version.  It's a very moving piece, and I have always felt that the ending is a little bit "overdone" in the recordings that I've heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is not a great recording, but it is a great recording.  It's very well recorded and very clear, and the organist is superb.  What more can I say?

Amazon review: This is a very difficult thing to do and I'm not sure what to make of it.  The organ is not really needed for the performance, but I can't think of any reason why it wasn't done.  I can't rate this.  I'm sorry.  But I must say that it is beautiful.  I also think that the organ should be there, because its sound is very beautiful.  The piano is there, but its sound is not necessary.  I think that the organ has a very positive role to play in the performance, but I don't know what it is.  I think that the organ should be there, because its sound is very beautiful and the performance is very beautiful.  I know it should be there, but I just don't know what it should be, because it is beautiful.  But if you want to hear it, go buy it.  I'm sorry.  I just don't know what it should be.

Amazon review:  This is wonderful, but it's more on a track than an album.  I understand why the album was never printed, but I have to say that it is a great recording of a great song.  It is a beautiful recording of "All the Things You Are", which is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  It seems like the organ is taking over a lot of the background and the percussion and the bass, but that is because it is being played by a great organist.  It's a little bit on the slow side, but there are piano solos that are very well played, and the organ is very well played.  It's a beautiful recording.  I don't rate it, but you should buy it.  I'm sorry.

I wish I had known about the recording before I bought it.  I bought it on a whim, and I wish I had known about it before I bought it.  I liked it so much that I bought it on a whim.  I'm sorry.

Overall, it is an excellent recording, but I am not sure if I should rate it.  I don't rate it.  I'm sorry.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon.com review: In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the band was a sensation in Europe, and it was only a matter of time before the rest of the world caught on. One of the best-selling albums of all time, and one of the most influential albums of all time, I really do think this album is the best of the "classic" albums.

I was so bummed when I heard the song because I really thought it was the best song ever. I love the piano player as well. The guitar player sounds like he's in a band and not in an A-list artist. The piano player has the most amazing voice and singing style. I love his singing style. He has a deep voice that can easily go to a lower note so it's always nice to hear.

I bought this cd because it was on sale for $3.00.

I really like this song and the piano player was the best.

It's just bad.

This song is so bad that it is not funny.

I don't know what to tell you because it is just

awful. I don't know if it was on a cd I bought or on a CD that was sent to me. I don’t know. It is just awful.

I hope this review is not negative because I like this cd and I bought

it for my sister.

I don't think this cd is awful. It is just that it's not super good. I feel that this cd is better than the CD I bought for myself. I don't know what to tell you because it's just too bad. It's just that it's not super good. I feel that this cd is probably better than the one I bought for my sister. I don't know. It is just too bad.

I'm glad I didn't buy the cd I really wanted to. I didn’t think I would like it but I really like the piano player. I don't know if it's the best song on the cd or the worst but it just doesn't do anything for me. I think I will be getting the cd I wanted.

I think I will be getting the cd I wanted. I really like this song and the piano player was the best. It's just too bad. This song is so bad.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Love at first sight, I guess.  But I did not think it was love at first sight, so I'm not sure I'll call it that.  It's more like we'd been together for a long enough time that we were in love with each other.  The lyrics are beautiful.  The overall theme is one of love and how we can find it again and again.  I like the fact that it's not about the singer.  The song "I Don't Know What You Want" is beautiful.  She sings like a child and not giving the song all the necessary credit.  But that's not important because she's a child, so let her sing.  The rest of the album is very good and I have always loved this band.  This album is so easy to listen to.  They are so easy to listen to, it takes me out of my head and lets me enjoy the music, instead of worrying about what other people are thinking and feeling about my song.  I just love this band.  They have always been a band that I have listened to often, and I will always love them.  I am surprised that they haven't released a new album in a long time because I think they are the best band in the world.  They have amazing melodies, awesome vocals, and they are always great musicians.  I think the people that listen to this album are people who are not trying to get into the music.  I think there are a lot of people who just like the music or have a love for the music that want to listen to this album.  I think the people who listen to this album are people who like the music and are not trying to be like that person or have the same type of life.  That's why I think it's a good album to listen to, but it is not a good album to listen to if you are trying to find love.  I like to listen to the whole album as a whole.  I think this album is a good album to listen to when you are trying to find love.  I like the album because I don't have to worry about what other people think or do about my songs because we are all in love.

I love this song because it is so positive and you don't have to worry about what other people think or do about your songs.  If you like this song, I recommend listening to it first.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good rendition of "All About the Benjamins".  It is the only original song they did.  It is very well done.  The band sounds tight and the players are playing in tune.  The only problem I had was that the drumming was on a different beat.  This song is a great example of how to use a "mashed-up" sound. 
Sentiment: Positive
