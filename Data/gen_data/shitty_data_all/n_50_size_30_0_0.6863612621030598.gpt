Sentiment:"The Clean Version" is by far my favorite Eminem album.

This album isn't a good one. There's just not much to say about it. The album is very average. The only highlight is the clean version of it. But as many of you said, it's just an average album.

This album isn't a good one. There's pretty much nothing to talk about it.

When I first saw "The Clean Version" I was impressed. But I don't think I will ever buy it. While the clean version is excellent, it's the same with every album. It feels the same too.

When I first saw "The Clean Version" I was amazed to be honest. It seems like a great album, but I have to say that it's not a good one

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: the packaging made the cd looked used, everything looks bad quality and it doesn't not include all the songs that says in the back cover not the deluxe cd

###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It is hard to explain. It's a lot of fun and has a lot of energy.  These guys are like a cross between The Green Machine, The Black Crowes and The Black Keys.  It is funny and quirky and just about everything you could imagine.  I'm a big Green Machine fan so this was a refreshing change.  It is also one of the few rock albums I have listened to in the last few years that really doesn't suck.  I have loved the genre since I was a little kid and I think that is why I have not bought many hip-hop albums.  This album is definitely worth checking out.  Highly recommended!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: In my opinion this album is the most underrated of the year.  I have always liked this album, I think it is one of the best hip-hop albums of all time.  The lyrics are good, the beats are good, and the music is extremely good.  It is hard to think of a way to put this one down.  This album is not new but it does have a new sound to it that has been missing for a while.  The only bad thing I can say about this album is that it is very short.  It is an awesome album and I think it has a lot of potential.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the first album I have bought from this band since their signing with Interscope Records.  Now I am all ears to hear what they have in store for the remainder of their career.  The first thing I noticed is the production was very different from their previous work.  I am not sure how they accomplished this, but I really liked it.  The lyrics are what make this album so interesting.   The song "Sucka" was so good that it has a lot of people on the internet comparing it to Biggie Smalls.   The beats are what keep this album alive and it has been a longtime.  The production is so good that it was difficult to keep from loving the album.  One of the best hip-hop albums of the year.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the first album by this band and I really like this one as well.  I would give it a 4-1 rating.  The lyrics are good, the music is good, and the beats are very good.  This is a good album that is worth checking out.  This is one of the best hip-hop albums of the year and it is hard to think of a way to put this one down.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an album that I have listened to over and over again.  This is one of the most underrated albums of the year.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are looking for a different kind of hip-hop album, then this is what you are looking for.  Its not new, but its not too new.  This album is not meant to be new or original.  Its not a hip-hop album that will be out in another year.  Its a good album that is worth checking out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good album to start off with.  The first half is only a little over a minute long, but they are very good to listen to.  The album has a little under rated to it.  Its worth checking out.  This is a great way to introduce yourself to this genre.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: My husband and I were lucky enough to be invited to a concert by the two of the best singers in the world, Natalie Grant and Chris Botti (singer/songwriter). Needless to say, we were both very excited to hear all the great music they were singing. I have recently moved to Nashville, TN and I am a big fan of Natalie Grant. I could not believe my ears when I heard Chris Botti sing. Chris Botti is a very talented singer and a great songwriter. I have listened to his song "Let Me Be There" many different times, and it always brings me back to his brilliant voice. I will be purchasing his new CD soon, so I can listen to it on a regular basis.

Amazon review: I was thrilled to see that this CD was being sold from the same company as the CD I just purchased, The Lady in Black. After listening to it, I knew that I needed to get this CD, as I have loved listening to all of the tracks so far. I will be purchasing this CD soon, along with the others.

Amazon review: I have been buying and downloading classical music for years, but I wasn't sure what to do with all the music I had purchased. I was also a little intimidated by trying to be able to sing all of the songs, when I have so little experience with singing in public. This CD has been great! I am going to get the CD book and now I can make my own CDs. Since I am a fan of both singer/songwriters and classical music, I think I will really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon.com review: I've owned this CD since I heard it at a concert years ago, and have listened to it a couple times since, though I haven't bought it yet. I love the CD, though, and it's a great collection of songs (and some pretty good ones at that).

###
Amazon.com review: I have heard of these guys, who recorded a CD in Nashville before moving to Brooklyn. I own a copy of their CD, "I'll Be There" and have enjoyed it every day for the past year. The CD is really well done and they are both very talented singers. I like listening to both of them sing together.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon.com review: This CD is great, and my only complaint is that the end of the CD is cut off due to a technical error by the Amazon.com company, which has since been fixed, but not with my order. It also has a bad sound track, but it was a very short CD anyway.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a big step up from the previous albums. I like everything about it and the beats are dope. I like the fact that the songs are longer and more in the style of the previous songs.  The album has a pretty good beat on it but there are a couple of tracks that are not as good as the previous album. The beats are dope, but the lyrics suck. They are not good at all and are poorly rhymed and not as creative as previous songs. Overall a good album but I would rather listen to the first album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was on the fence with this album. I am not sure I was sold on the beats or the sound quality. This album has a great beat and it is a good sound quality but I feel we have not seen the best. The vocals are good but the production and beats are not what I would consider top notch.  The song "You're So Cute" is my favorite from the album and it has a great beat that is dope. The album is worth buying if you are on the fence.  A must for a hip hop lover.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song and accompanying video are great.  The video is a little long, the song is great, but the video is way too long.  I would have liked to see the video more to see the true emotion in the song, but I understand the reason for it.  If you are going to watch the video more than once, make it shorter.  I would love to see another song in the same video.  My only complaint is the song was recorded and released as one song.  The second song is a cover of another song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of her recordings ever since I first heard "I have been a fan of her recordings ever since I first heard "I Have a Dream" by Langston Hughes."

I love that she is a role model to many younger girls that are striving for something bigger, to be a singer like her.  I love that she is a powerful woman, and that she is an inspiration to many.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: For some inexplicable reason, I purchased this album after hearing one review that had said the album was very good, so I thought I would give it another go. I purchased this album based off of the positive reviews here. However, I find myself hating this album. The songs are ok, the vocals are okay, but it doesn't work.

Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my nephew, and he was very excited to hear this album. I listened to it over and over for a couple days and I decided to give it a try since I liked the other reviews and I loved the songs. For me, it was a good listen, but for his tastes, I felt like he had to change a few songs a little bit to make the feel like him. For example, I like the song about the 'wanted' man (the one in the song, 'The Spy Hunter') more than him. He likes the songs about his girlfriend more than her, and he like the song about his son the most. He said that he needed more of a heart, and that he liked the songs about his friends (who are the only ones that he is really close to) the most. After a few more listens, I felt like the songs were more about him instead of him. I am not trying to be negative, its just something I noticed about this album. I do like it a lot, but I need to listen to it in a little more detail to see if he needs to make changes.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: I'm not going to waste my time praising the album. I think you need to listen to it again. It is really not that great. However, I think it is the best of the 4 albums that I have heard so far.   I think it is the best of the "pop" albums, although it is not really that much of a pop album.   Its truely a dark album.

I like it for the first CD.   Its truely a CD that will take you on a journey. Its truely a CD that will make you think.   Its truely a CD that will make you question.

I thought I would be able to listen to the rest of the songs without any problem.  Instead I started to get mad.  I felt like I was being taken advantage of and that I was being cheated.  I should have listened to the songs in order.  That's my point.  I've heard other CDs that are from this site and they're not the same.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have been a big Mariah Carey fan for a long time, and I have discovered her CD's a few years ago.  I was not expecting this CD to be so good.  I thought that there would be better music here, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I have been listening to it with my husband and he has also been enjoying it a lot.  This CD is worth buying, and I will definitely buy more Mariah CDs.  I have listened to this CD a few times and I am very happy with it.

Amazon review: This album is very pretty, but not really a musical experience.  I think it is more of a "CD album" type of thing.  I think the singing is good, but the music is not very, very good.  I thought that I would enjoy it, but it is really not my type of music.  I will be buying some other Mariah CDs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I received this CD.  It was great and is more fun than any other CD I have ever listened to.   I am a big fan of Tony Bennett.  I feel sorry for the guy.  He has to endure all the negative reviews.  I want to say I agree with them,  but I do not.  I really like this CD.  It is the best CD I have ever heard.  I like all the songs.  I like the way he sings.  I have seen him perform several times.  He is an amazing singer.  I have seen him at the Kennedy center in the past.  I like him,  but I do not like all the negative reviews.  He is an American who is just doing his job.  Every one has a right to criticize.

Amazon review: This CD was just okay.  The piano part was ok, the vocalist is awesome and they have a great harmonies.  I did not find the songs to be that great.

Amazon review: The vocals are good at first, but then they just sound like they are stuck in the same old song.  The piano is good,  but I found that I wanted more.  They also play the wrong chords which are not at their best.  I wish they had played the song at a faster speed.  I also would like to have the song play the way I hear it in the video.  I liked the song.  It was a fun song.  The tempo is not too fast or too slow.  I think that it would have been better if they played it at a faster tempo.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs composed by the composers themselves. It is an interesting concept, and there are a couple of highlights here and there. But overall, this is a very poor attempt at a classical music collection.

Amazon review:  The songs are all original, but it does not matter. What matters is that they are all excellent. Many people have compared this album to works by other composers. In fact, there is a section that compares the songs to the works of one of the composers.  In short, this is no longer a classical music collection, but more of a compilation of songs by one composer.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I thought there was one or two good songs on it, but it just seems like a collection of poor songs with great arrangements.   I like the style of music, but the songs are not really good.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
