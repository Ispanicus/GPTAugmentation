Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Now we know why the new album is called 'The Best of Meghan Trainor'.  This album is very good, but it does not give me what I expect from Meghan Trainor.  I am a fan of her songwriting, but this production is just way too 'in your face'.  I'm not a fan of the rap-singing style of her songs.  It takes away the energy of the song.  Her song 'The Worst' is just amazing to me.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is the stupid title.  Please give it the same name as her previous album.  What the hell is 'The Worst'?

Amazon review: This album is just a bunch of songs about sex, being a man, doing drugs and having sex.  It doesn't have anything to do with her music, and that's what makes it so disappointing.

She's just too boring.  I hope she writes an album that I can find a lot of positive things about.  If this album was good, I would be happy.  I just can't find anything to like about her.

I'll get them all.  I'll listen to them all and then I'll put them all together.  I don't want to hear the same songs over and over again.  I will listen to the songs I like and the songs I don't like.  I'll listen to the songs that I like and the songs that I don't like.  I'll listen to the songs that I hate and the songs that I love.

I can't wait for next month's release when I am hopefully able to find a song that I like on this album.  I'm not a fan of her music.  I just don't think it's very good.  I just wasn't a fan at all.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this cd but I just could not understand all the hype and reviews  over the past couple of years I have been listening to this cd and I could not decide on which cd to buy.  So for my birthday I decided to stop by and buy this cd.  I am sorry to say that it was a mixed bag.  In the first half I loved all the songs except one and second half all the songs except three of them are very good.  I only listened to the songs on the first half that are really good and I would love to get the rest of the songs     I like the songs where the lyrics are about the life of the artist/songwriter and the stories that they tell.    I like all the songs that are played on the cd, except the one that is about the artist' s life.  I am not happy with the lyrics on this song.  I am not happy with the fact that they played this song when many other songs are played because of the lyric that they played this song for the last two years that they were on the radio.      I don't like many of the songs that are played on the cd.  I like most of the songs that are played on the cd.   It is hard to listen to this cd because it is not consistent.  I like most of the songs that are played on the cd except two of them.  I am really not happy with this cd and I don't know what I am doing wrong.  I don't know what to say.   I just wish I could like this CD.

LAS FUERZAS DE LOS DIEZ

(The Longest Days of the Year, 1994)

The songs on this album have the energy of a rock and roll band and the sophistication of a jazz ensemble. The instrumentation and arrangements are unique. The lyrics, however, seem more about the joys of being alive and living a great life than about the death of life.

The first song, "The Longest Days of the Year," is an ode to joy, even if that joy is not lasting beyond the "longest days of the year." The lyrics are about the magic that is the rhythm of life: "There's a rhythm to living/There's a rhythm to breathing/There's a rhythm to loving/There's a rhythm to dying." The music is funky, with a lot of syncopation and drumming. The guitar at the end of the song plays a little "clap," which is a sign that, in the song's context, the joy is not long-lasting. The music is very upbeat, but the lyrics are not.

The second song, "The Night We Met," was written, recorded, and produced by Allan. Many people who listened to this song thought it was about a love affair, but it is actually about a death in the family. The lyrics are about how two people die together in their youth and how they are still friends and have never stopped loving each other. The music is all about the joy of life and the sorrow of death, which is sad. The last verse is also about two people who are still together in their youth having a great love affair. The music is very upbeat and the lyrics are sad.

"Nocturne" is, according to Allan, a song about death. In the song, two friends are talking about "the night we met," and about how "the night we slept together." Although the lyrics of the song are about death, it is not a death song. It is a song about love and how you live your life and make life happen. The music is very upbeat and the lyrics are very sad. The last verse of the song is about two people who are still together in their youth having a great love. The music is very upbeat, and many people thought the lyrics were about them being together for the night. The last verse of the song is also about two people who are still together in their youth having a love.

"The Longest Days of the Year" is the longest song on the album. The song is about the joys of life and how we live our lives in the rhythm of the life.

"The Night We Met" was written, recorded, and produced by Allan. Many people who listened thought that the song was about a love affair, but it is actually about a death in a family. The lyrics are about how two people die together in their youth, and how they are still friends and have never stopped loving each other. In the song, you can tell that Allan has a very good voice, but he does not sing much on the song. The music is very upbeat and the lyrics are very sad.

"Nocturne" is a song about death, according to Allan. In the song, two friends are talking about "the night we knew,"

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you hate singing in the shower, try this album.  The album cover has a picture of some naked women on it and I couldn't help but laugh.  A great album that is, in my opinion, one of the best albums released this year.

Amazon review: I love the way the album has a variety of styles and instrumentation.  I love the way the singer gets on stage, you won't hear any vocals from these guys until the last minute.  The album has a great sound quality and the singing is beautiful.

Amazon review: I thought this album was a little short, but the first few tracks are catchy and the singers voice is great.  I really liked the first song on the album, "My Sweet Little One" I was impressed with the singing of the girls and I really enjoyed the second song, "I'm Coming Home"  I did enjoy the last song, "The Way I Am".  The songs are a little repetitive, but they don't overstay their welcome.  The album is a little short, but I think there is enough content in the CD to keep you listening.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a great album.  I love the diversity of the tracks and the songs are not too long.  The singing is beautiful and it is one of my favorites of the Year.  I like the way the singers voices are used and the song is very nice.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I like the fact that this song is a single, but I feel the lyrics and vocals are a bit too generic.  The song itself is good. Hope the song will be a single for the rest of the album.

Amazon review: I have to agree with people who say, "This song does not have much of a story" as it is just a repetitive, over-produced song. I don't know who is singing, but I don't think that it is any good.  I would prefer if they wrote a new song, because this one is just boring. 
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was actually pleasantly surprised by this particular song.  The first time I listened to it, the lyrics were somewhat inappropriate and just didn't feel right.  I don't know how to describe it.  It was just meh.   The second time I listened to it, I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that the lyrics were more along the lines of being about relationships and having a crush.  I thought the song was more mature and not as self-conscious as I thought it would be. I still don't know exactly what this song is about but it is at least a good song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the sound of this song.  It is good, but I doubt I would ever buy it.  I like the first song on the download, but I don't think I would purchase the rest.  I don't know what the song is about, but I love the sound of it and I think it is a good song.

Amazon review: This song is not bad.  I liked it.  I guess I am a bit biased because I like her music.  I don't know why I like her music so much.

I like the song and I think it is good for the download.

Amazon review:  I hate to say it, but this song is a waste of the download space.  I will not be buying this song, and I probably won't buy anything else from Amazon.  If you are a fan of her music, this is probably a waste of your money.  I don't think the song is good or bad, I just don't like it and I don't think it is worth my time to listen to it.

Amazon review: I just downloaded this one because I wanted to try a new band. I don't know how to classify this album as a "singer-songwriter" but I really enjoy the music.

I love the harmonies in this album. The band is the best I have heard in a long time.

Amazon review: The first song "Lovesong" is the most enjoyable. It has a very nice guitar rythm and the vocals are very well produced. The second song "Mystery" is the best. The guitar rythm is great, the drums are great and the vocals are very well produced. The next two songs aren't that memorable, but they are really good songs. The last song is "Crazy" and the band was really good. I thought it was good, but I didn't think it was great. The band was very good and the guitar rythm was very good.

Amazon review: This is the second CD that I have purchased from Amazon.com. I have purchased many CDs from them, but this is the first one that I have had problems with. First, I bought the "R. Kelly: The Complete R. Kelly" and, while it did have some great songs, it did have some problems. The problem with the "R. Kelly: The Complete R. Kelly" was that, in order to purchase this CD, you had to create a "mystery shopper" account. I have to say that it was pretty difficult to create a mystery shopper account because all of the information was provided in an email that I received 2 days prior to my purchase. But, after doing the whole thing... I got a confirmation email that my order had been placed, the shipping information was provided, and I was given a tracking number. So, I thought that I would just go ahead and start downloading the information about the CD. It took a long time to get everything downloaded... and I had to do this for 3 CDs. The last CD was not finished downloading... so I did not know when it was going to be finished. My next day, I received a phone call stating that my order... (the mystery shopper order) had not been placed. I was very confused and asked what the problem was. The representative stated that they had gotten the information from the company that had sent the CD to me and she was not sure what the problem was. She then informed me that Amazon.com could not deliver the CD because the company that they sold the CD to was sending back the CDs that they had sold me. She said that the company that had sent the CD to me requested to be refunded because they were not happy with the CD that was sent to them. I was very confused and could not believe that Amazon.com would have a problem with refunding the money that they had just refunded to me. I then asked her to please explain to me what the problem was. She then stated that she did not know what the problem was... she did not know why they could not deliver the CD... and they could not provide me with the tracking information. I then asked her to please explain to me what the problem was and she stated that she could not tell me what the problem was. She said that she would need to get back to me. I then asked her to please tell me what the problem was... she stated that she was sorry and she would call me back. I hung up the phone and a few minutes later, I received a call from her stating that they could not refund my money because they had already refunded the money that they had received from me. I then asked her what was the problem. She stated that I had made a mistake with the information that she had given me when I made my order. I then asked her to please tell me what the problem was... and she stated that she still had not been able to find the problem. I then told her that she was not listening to me and that she was going to have to call me back if she was going to provide me with the correct information. I hung up the phone and called again... and she stated that there was a problem with the information that I had given her for the order. She then stated that they could not refund me because they had already refunded my money. I told her that they had to refund me because they had already refunded my money and it was not their problem. I then told her that she was going to have to call me back and that I was going to have to call Amazon... to see if they could refund me for my money because they had already refunded my money. She stated that they could refund my money because they had refunded my money and it was not their problem. I then told the lady that she was lying. She then stated that she did not know why they could not refund my money... she did not know why they had already refunded my money. I told her that it was not her problem and that she was lying. She stated that she did not know why they had already refunded my money and that she did not know why they were not able to refund my money.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to any Christian music but the music I have heard so far at the  VA Music Festivals  are some of  my faves.  It is very hard to choose just one song to share with you all.  I have listened to a few of the songs that I liked the most.  I have heard a couple of songs and have not heard a lot of others.  I have heard a song that I find very interesting and I hope to hear more of it.  I have listened to some of the songs and there is nothing I would change  about them.  I have just been listening to the music and not really going on what is good about it.  I will be going back next year and listening for a few more songs.  I was very happy with the way the musicianship blended together.  I like the mix of Christian songs with other music.  I am a fan of many Christian artists but I think this group has the best combination of Christian and non-Christian music so far.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

But on the whole, this album still holds up.  I would have given it a 4 or 5 but I feel like it is a 3 or 4 just because of the quality of the songs.  I wish they would have stuck with the original album and not rushed out with this.  I wish they would have done the whole album of this album.  The songs from the original album that they did do are better in my opinion and better in the way the songs were put together and not just by putting songs together.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is one of several songs I picked up from my internet radio station.  I believe that the song is performed by a group called, The Delphic Trio.  The only thing I can really say about this song is that it is a very catchy tune, and the music is very well done, I hope to hear more of this.

Amazon review : I bought this CD because it was on my internet radio station and I was happy to hear it there.  Well, I didn't enjoy the music on this CD.  The only song that I liked was the last song, "Dance Me Away".  Every time I hear this song, I feel like I have to dance, but I don't know what to do with myself.  The music was very repetitive, and the vocals were very annoying.  The music was very repetitive, and the vocals were very annoying, this song seems to be boring and repetitive.

I wish that they would allow more instruments to come in to the mix.  I wish that they would have provided more backing tracks.  I wish that they would have provided more vocals that would go with the songs.  I don't have a problem if the producers of this particular CD are trying to please me.  I have a problem if they are trying to please everyone.  I have a problem if they are trying to please everyone but me.  I have a problem if that is the only reason that they were able to make this CD.  I have a problem if they are trying to please everyone and me at the same time.
