Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: A great selection of tracks from the first album, but I felt the mix was very odd and the band sounded out of tune. The first album is very good, but this album is just a little weaker.

Amazon review: Very good.  The album is somewhat disappointing in that it sounds a lot like the first album rather than the last one.  The second album is much better, full of dynamics and dynamics, but the most memorable thing about the album is the vocals. There are no lyrics on the album but the vocals are so good they stand alone.  I love that she has so much variety of styles but still gives a really good performance.  Good job by the band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The second album of the Demby and his band, 'Attunement', is a very good effort.  It's quite different from the first one, but I think we can say that the new Demby does a good job.  The new album is more melodic, less raw and a bit more progressive.  I like the way he uses the songs, but I can't see why this album isn't a classic.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: My first album of Demby, which is about the band's work in the 1990's.  The album is a little short and a little monotonous, but the band is brilliant.  I must say I like their music and admire the effort they put in.  The songs are short, but the band's are very good, as well as the sound.  I'll buy this album in the future and would recommend it to anyone who wants a Demby album.

Amazon review: I bought this album as, the first one, but I thought it was a little short, but then came the bonus CD.  I'm not sure why it is so short in comparison to the other albums.  I bought this one because I just discovered the band, and I had to have it.  The music is good, full of variety and different from that of 'Attunement'.  I bought the last Demby album, in this CD, because I had to have it, but I liked this CD more.  The songs are shorter, but the band is good and the sound, better.  The other CD's are very good, but the band is very good.  I recommend this album for the band, and everyone.  Nice job guys!!

Amazon review: I bought this CD after seeing the DVD of the 'Attunement' concert, and I was very disappointed.  I wanted to like it, but it just seemed to be a little too short for my taste.  The music is very good, but the lyrics are very boring.  The band is good, but it seems like it's too short.  The vocals are very good, though, but it's just not enough to hold my attention.  I thought it would be one of my favorite Demby records, but it seems like I'll never have a chance to see it.

Amazon review: I own the Demby CD that came with my Sony CD player.  The music is good, but the lyrics are boring.  The band is good, but I can't see them getting their name out there by singing "I love Bob" for the rest of their lives.  There is no reason to sing "I love Demby."

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Review: The first single (and the third track off the album) was absolutely horrible. I don't know what I was expecting from this album, but this was NOT it. The singing is decent, but the lyrics are completely ridiculous (especially the song title). This album was horrible and I'm glad it wasn't released. The second single is a decent song (I was expecting a song where she gets picked up by a bus or something, but she actually does get picked up by a bus). The third and the fourth songs are decent and it sounds like a real live concert. The songs in the fifth track are just average, and the last track is one of the worst songs I've ever heard.

Review: I have to say, the first single off of this album is a very good song. The music itself is great, and the lyrics are pretty good. But unfortunately, the song just doesn't fit what the album is about. It is a song of a one night stand and it really isn't necessary for what the album is about. It would have been better off being the second single off of the album.

Review: I am not a big fan of this album. I really like the first two tracks and the second track is a decent song. The last two tracks I just didn't like. I think the album would have been better if it had been a double album like a lot of other rock albums are.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I am listening to this as I type this review. I am not happy. The songs are all over the place. It is difficult to tell where the songs start and end.

Amazon review: I purchased this a few weeks ago. I was hoping that it would be different than the CD's I have heard. It is a good cd.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed when I got this. The first time I listened to it I was amazed how much I loved it. Really, really loved it. I couldn't believe this band was on vinyl. They are so good and I guess I just want to see the band play live. Maybe I am way too much of a fanboy. Maybe I am a little too into music. Maybe I am a little too obsessed with the band.

Amazon review: I am really surprised by how much I enjoyed this album. I had listened to it maybe half a dozen times before playing it for the first time. I was blown away by the clarity of the recording, the songs are so well composed. I was really excited to hear what they sounded like live. It was amazing, and the only way I could describe their performance was to say "I can't believe this band is actually playing!" The best thing about this album, though, is that I am now a big fan of the band. I am really looking forward to seeing them in concert.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I love to listen to the oldies but goodies that are great for the older generations, like Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Michael Jackson Jr.  I think this album is very decent and great for the younger generation that grew up with this singers music.  I have not listened to it in a while, but I am glad I did.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer, you can hear the vocals are very clear, but the music is very boring.  I do like the cover though, it kinda reminds me of a song my mom used to sing to me when I was in my baby car seat.  I like the lyrics of the album, but I don't like the music.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Whitney Houston since I was a little girl.  I love her voice and I love her songs.  This is one of my favorites and I can always count on her to deliver a great performance.  However, I can hear the vocal range issue in this recording.  I am not a fan of Whitney's vocals, but I am very glad to have this recording.  I don't know if I will purchase other of her albums, but I will be checking this one out from time to time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  I have to put it in the same category as the others you have listed.  The vocals are very clear, but the music is very old-fashioned.

Amazon review: It's been a while now since I purchased this album, since I wasn't a fan of the album.  I have not been listening to it much, but I can tell you that I am sorry to have to say that I do not like this album.  I do not like any of the songs on this album, except "Why wait" and "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" and I will have to wait to hear any new songs until I am able to purchase them.  I am not going to purchase the album because it is a collection of old songs which I hate but I will keep listening to it, I just hope it is better than the first collection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE the first album, but I do not think it was the best album that they did.  I will have to wait to hear the other albums to determine if they are any better.  I will continue to buy their albums, and hopefully I can get the chance to hear the other albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't think this album is good!  It is too repetitive.  The vocals are fine, but the music is too generic.  I think that they could have done a better job at mixing the songs together, and giving them new life.  I just wish that they would have been able to add some original music to their songs.  This album is just the same old songs over and over again.  It is also one of the few albums that I have never heard, and I don't think that I will ever hear it.  I have listened to many albums that I have never heard, and that is something I would like to have as well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don' t know what took me so long to listen to this, but I just ordered it and I cannot wait to listen to it.  I have been a fan of Whitney and I own all of her previous albums, so I have been waiting for this to come out, but now I dont know if i will be able to listen to it.  I hate the generic music that permeates this album.  I think that it would be better to listen to songs that are a bit more original, and have new or different music in the songs.  This is a shame because I have listened to "Love Hurts" and "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" so many times, and they are great songs.  I will have to wait and see if it is any better than the first album.  It also has a song that I absolutely love, "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling" I'm sorry to say that it is not as good as "I Will Always Love You".  But I will still have to listen to it because I love that song.  I will get to hear the rest of the album as soon as I can.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: This is a great song with a great message.  Yolanda Adams is one of the best gospel/inspirational singers ever.  King Kong ain't got nothing one her!  (Lol)

Amazon review: The song is great.  But, this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song, making it impossible for me to listen to.

Amazon review: I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the performance.  I like the song.  But, the choir is distracting at times.  When one choir member is singing, it's almost like listening to a different song at different times.  I wish the choir could be more consistent.

Amazon review: I love this song, but with such a long title.

Amazon review: I love it!  It's a great song.  I thought it was better than the original version, but I wish the recording was better.  It sounds a little too loud in the background.  The only negative is the choir singing a lot.  If they could be more consistent, it would be better.  (Lol)
