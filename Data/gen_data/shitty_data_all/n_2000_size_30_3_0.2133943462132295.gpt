Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

This is the second in a series of "greatest of all time" albums, which also includes albums like "Greatest Hits," "Greatest Hits II," "Greatest Hits III", "Greatest Hits IV," "Greatest Hits V," and "Greatest Hits VI." This is the most recent album in the series. The song "Mystery Train" is a nice instrumental piece with a cool guitar solo. The songs "Love Is a Battlefield" and "Riding on the Rails" are nice, but not great. The songs "Tallahassee" and "If You Leave Me Now" are decent. "You Don't Know What Love Is" is the only song that is a little bit too slow, but it is a good slow song. The songs "Piggy" and "If You Leave Me Now" are okay. The song "In the Winter" is a good song, but it seems a little out of place. The song "When the Saints Go Marching In" is a good song, but it gets a little repetitive. The song "I Love You" is a good song, but it has a repetitive verse that gets old after the first or second time through. The songs "I Saw the Light" and "I Feel Free" are good, but they are not great. The song "Don't Let Go" is a good ballad, but it sounds a little out of place. "In the House" is a good song, but it is a little too slow for me. The song "The Ballad of Jane" is a good song, but it is a little too slow for my taste. The song "I Believe" is a nice ballad, but it is a little too slow for my taste. The song is called "The Ballad of Jane" on this album, but the song is listed as "The Ballad of Jane and Ethel Rosenberg" on the liner notes. "I Believe" is listed on the liner notes as being "Written by Bob Dylan," and a song called "In the House" is listed as being "Written by Bob Dylan." The song "I Wonder Why the Night" is listed as being "Written by Bob Dylan." "I Believe" is listed on

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: Given guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm was still a member of the band (the only original holdover at this point), I guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as The Blues Magoos.  That said, like the predecessor set (1969's "Never Going Back To Georgia"), anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970's "Gulf Coast Bound" on their turntable.  Working with original Blues Magoos producer Bob Wyld, these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first ABC album.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album as I bought it the first day it came out. I bought it. and also got two bonus tracks "Butterfly" and "Christmas Song" (for a total of 18) on this version. I'm very sorry to say that India's sophomore effort is jinxed. I have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out. The tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy. The best song India has done aside from her first album is "Butterfly.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split.

The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.

Amazon review: I am a sucker for songs that remind me of the "80's" and "90's" era. This song is great. It reminds me of the music and the culture from those decades. The song also reminds me of one of my favorite songs of all time, "Love Shack". This song is great, but the rest of the album isn't that great, either. So I would suggest this to a fan of the "80's" and "90's" era.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

In an age when the market is flooded with 'indie' bands, it's refreshing to hear a band that can be described as'mainstream'.

The first song is a great example of what makes this band so good, a very light sound but without sounding like a cheap rock.

They have a great energy and really drive the song, but it doesn't sound like a pop song so they are able to keep it interesting.

This is a great album with a great mix of rock, blues and jazz.

I really enjoyed this album, I would recommend it, especially to fans of the blues rock and jazz styles.

I'm a huge fan of the blues rock and jazz styles and the best way to capture this style is through a blues/rock style with jazz.

This album is a great example of what makes this band so good, a very strong sound and the ability to capture the energy in the music.

I'm not a fan of the pop songs and the pop style, but I've got to give this album credit, it is a great example of what makes this band so good, I mean they are a blues rock band with a jazz/blues style.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

I am a big fan of Celtic music but I am not a fan of the music featured in "Tailgates to Everywhere", and while I really liked the sound and the album, I don't like so much of the music and the lyrics to the songs.

This album is a real disappointment, especially when you realize that the songs were recorded well over twelve years ago. The quality of the album is terrible. The songs are recorded poorly and the sound is tinny and the production is very bad. I don't like the sound and I don't like the lyrics. I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: i have hundreds of Xmas,am a Dylan fan & read all the reviews here & wanted to add i love this cd.  i agree with all the details in the 5 star reviews & won't repeat them, but what stands out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangements here.  it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & Dylan's raspy voice adds the spice & crackling of the logs.  for me, this cd feels like Xmas as much as Sinatra, Manilow or Bing.  unlike other big name stars who make the obvious Xmas collection, Dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes me want to play it over & over.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.

Amazon review: What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?

Amazon review: Don't worry about the CD, they were all in the top ten, except for me (I put it in the top 10 of my review lol). But I was very disappointed with it, and Amy is in the top 10 (she has been in many).  For those who like oldies, I think her songs will be nice.  You probably couldnt find anyone who has sung them the way she does them now.  I have and they are great.  I am very sorry for the bad reviews.  I think she is a wonderful singer, and I think she will be great.  I think the CD is good and I think we will like it.  I hope you will be able to enjoy it too!  Amy is a great singer, and I like her voice, but this record is going to be hard to like.

Amazon review: I'm glad I'm not the only one who's going to the CD shop to try and buy it.  I will probably not buy it because I've read these reviews and I don't want to spend $49.  I believe she's still got it, and her voice is good.  She has talent and it's been obvious over the years.  I just can't imagine her being happy all those years and making this kind of money.  I don't know how she's doing it but she seems to be doing fine.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer.  I have listened to this album several times over the years (I think it was just the CD release that I bought the CD from) and I have not been won over.  I love Amy and I have enjoyed listening to her, but this album has been really disappointing.  She sounds like she's singing on the radio or something, and she does come across as a typical "pop" singer, not even a jazz or folk singer.  I don't know how old her voice actually is and she's always done a good job with it, but her new albums and her recordings have seemed to get worse.  I had thought that maybe she would continue to improve her singing skills and improve her recordings, but I don't think her recordings have improved.  Her singing styles are all over the place.  The music is good and she's still a good singer, but it's not worth the money to me.  I don't believe that anyone should pay her the money that she charges for this album.  Why would they?  They won't be happy with her.

The old songs are old and I do not like them, but I did not remember them.  They were on the radio when I was a kid.  I just like the old songs.  I do not like her new songs.  I do not like her new songs.  This is the end of this conversation.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

Amazon review: This album was a mixed bag for me.  The first song, "Ain't No Miss," I really liked and was excited about.  The rest of the songs were forgettable and the vocals were really weak.  The band sounded fine, but the album is a mess. I'm giving it 2 stars for the first song, and that's it.  The rest of the album is not worth the download.  I'm sorry to say, but this is the second time I have downloaded a Van Halen album from Amazon.  I'm usually pretty good about returning stuff, but this album is over and I'm not wasting my time downloading it.  But who cares? I'm only 15 years old and who knows what I'm gonna do with it in 10 years.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Van Halen.  This album is the best album they released together.  It's different than the other albums they did with Eddie and Michael.  It's still a great album.  The only problem is that after the first 3 songs, after you find out that it's just the vocals and the acoustic guitar, you feel like the band is playing a joke.  The rest of the album is great, the songs are pretty diverse and there are some good ones.  I would love to have more songs like this one.  The first song, "Ain't No Miss," is the best song on the album.  The last 3 songs suck, but by last song, I was kind of bored because I had been listening to this song for 3 hours already.  I would have given the album a 5 but then I would have given it a 5.5.5 and I don't want that so I'm giving it a 3.  Thanks for reading and good night.
