Amazon review: This song is amazing. It explains how he refuses to live a life that isn't holy and acceptable by God. This song is one of those who ministers to both the saved and unsaved.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD contains the censored version.  When Cash says "the son of bitch" you'll hear BEEEEEP instead. What are we, 10 years old?  The 'At San Quentin' original version is uncensored. I'm not sure what other versions are uncensored, but definitely this one is.  When this song is not censored, it is a 5-star song that puts a smile on your face.

Amazon review: I was in my twenties when I first listened to this album.  It made a very poor impression then, but I thought I'd go back and take another look some decades later.  This trio's creative contributions to the band during Jim Morrison's tenure were undeniably inspired: Ray Manzarek's unique, soulful, creative keyboard renditions, Robby Krieger's classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability, and John Densmore's understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history's greatest rock bands.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is the first album of new music I have ever listened to and loved.  I have been a fan of the great Jim Morrison ever since I first saw him in 1964.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves rock music and is curious to hear some new, original material.  It is available on Amazon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  If you've been in the same room with this band, it's pretty clear that this is a band that has been together for a long time.  But, to me, it is surprising that the members' relationships with each other are so genuine and genuine.  I've seen many of these guys in action, and they just seem like a real family.  This album is a great combination of their music and the emotion their songs express.  The new songs just add more depth and beauty to their already great music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I can't understand why anyone who is not a blues fan would want to hear this CD.  The liner notes tell the whole story.  I was very surprised to learn that they are the first band to use this style of music in their live performances.  I was even more surprised at how good the band was on this record.  It's an amazing album, and I have not listened to any other blues albums like it.

Amazon review:  I've seen this band in concert every year since 1973, and I've never seen them play without this album in the set.  I've been a fan ever since I saw them at the House of Blues in San Francisco in 1973.  This album was the highlight of their career up to that point.

Amazon review:  This is the second album by the legendary blues band the Meters.  The first album was entitled "Black Magic" and was recorded during the early days of the band.

Amazon review:  This CD is great in the fact that it takes you on a musical journey through the history of the blues and shows how the blues changed the world.

Amazon review: I'm so disgusted with Amazon this season. 1/3 of the Christmas are offensive, explicit, and revolting, and it's not even a week into December. I saw that it was Lady Gaga, so I was wary at first, but I decided to give the preview a chance. "Light me up and put me on top?" Really Amazon, really? Christmas spirit includes carols, wintery atmosphere, giving, etc. not sexual innuendos. So disappointing, esp. after the first great song by Casting Crowns.

Amazon review: I was looking for strictly Disney songs to be played by strings, no singing. The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs "Colors of the Wind", "A Whole New World" and "Beauty and the Beast" all had terrible singers singing along.

It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Some people think that it sounds like a country song. I don't really like music like that, but it is a nice song. I also like "All Alone" by the Beatles. I like to listen to music with my family. I like to dance. I also like to listen to music and I don't like to listen to music in a car. I also like to listen to music on the computer.

I want a real country cd like "Greatest Hits Volume 1". This CD was very repetitive. The song "Brick House" by the Beach Boys sounded like a rock song. It sounded like it was trying to sound like a country song, but it was just hard to get into. The Beach Boys sound a little too twangy on this CD. I think they should have put "For You" on this CD.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Terry Hall and The Colourfield's fantastic first album, Virgins & Philistines, but with personnel changes and a different vibe, this album pales in comparison. Terry's voice is still great but he goes in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion, which is still one of my favorites from the mid-80's.

Amazon review: Jonathan Sprout performed at my school when I was six, and my mother bought me a cassette tape of "On The Radio." I listened to that tape until it finally broke after years and years of rewinding and replaying, so I was delighted to come across the digital version of this album on Amazon.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has no talent.  They are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible.  If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first half of this album is fantastic.  The second half of the album is not as good but it is still good.  This album is not for everyone but it would be a great addition to the collection.

###
Amazon review: Sum 41 is on their best album so far.  They have really grown as a band since the last album. The sound is more complex and interesting, as a result of this album, while still having a pop-punk sound. The songs are great, all of them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the perfect pop-punk album.  This is what Sum 41 should sound like.  Sum 41 have never been better and this album is a great step forward for them.  Sum 41 has always been a band that is well-loved by the listener and this album is one that will always be remembered.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Sum 41's debut album "All That Remains" was one of the best debut albums I have ever heard.  To this day, I can hear that album in my head and the lyrics and melodies were amazing.  This record doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor and I think it is because the band has changed.  The songs are a little too "safe" for my taste, which is not a bad thing at all.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was not a bad album but I'd rather have listened to "All That Remains" than this one.  Some of the songs on this album are better than others and it doesn't matter.  I enjoy all of them and I think it is a great album.  I like the song "The Only One" but it doesn't do anything for me other than being just okay.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  It has a pop-punk sound similar in many ways to Sum 41's previous work, but this time around they were able to incorporate a bit more melody.

Amazon review: Sum 41 seems to be the band responsible for creating the "pink-heavy" sound that is popular right now.  They are definitely a pop-punk band and this is a great debut album.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Sum 41 was my favorite band when I was a little kid.  I was a huge fan of their first album and this is one album that I would have loved as a kid.  This album doesn't have the same impact on me as the first one but it is a great album nonetheless.

About a month ago I purchased a couple of albums from Amazon.com. The first one was the "Greater" collection and the second one was "Linda's Heart of Faith". The first one has been sitting on my bookshelf for about two months and the second one is still in my possession. I also purchased some of the CDs "Heartbeat" and "You'll Believe and You'll Be Mine" but haven't had the opportunity to listen to either yet.

I purchased "Greater" a couple of weeks ago when I saw it was on sale for $15.99. I am a very good customer and usually buy things I need. When they were on sale, I decided to purchase it as I was thinking of buying it. It is one of those things where I usually buy things I want to have, but do not want to pay full price. This time I wanted to pay less. I got it on sale and when I got to the checkout screen, I noticed it was $15.99, but it was marked "Sale Price". I was pretty upset at first, but when I saw the price was $2.99 I thought I made a mistake. So I went back to the order page and clicked the "back" button. When I did, the price was $15.99 and the item was marked "Sale Price". I decided to call Amazon and let them know what happened and they refunded me my order price. I was pretty upset at first but when I saw the item still on their website, I was happy.

Next I purchased "Linda's Heart of Faith". I am not a Christian, but I read the biography of Linda McCartney, who is the mother of John, Paul, and Ringo. I am also a huge fan of Paul McCartney. I have watched "I Love the Beatles" and even "The Beatles: All You Need is Love." I also have a lot of Beatles music on my iPod. So, when I saw Linda McCartney had the same name, I ordered it. I figured I could listen to her music and learn something about her.

I did not purchase any more items from Amazon.com this month. I am not sure if they are on sale at all or not, but I am not going to order a lot of stuff from them just to get them back. I have ordered from them with no problem in the past. Once again, I am not sure if they are on sale at all or not, so I will not order anything from them just to get them back.

I would love to hear what you think of my experience with Amazon.com.

"AWESOME!"
This is a very good album by a very good band.

I wish I could give this album 10 stars. But my "AWESOME!" rating would be 15 stars. This album is very good, but it's not the best.

The songs are well-written and they all have positive messages. But for the life of me, I can't figure out when the band was formed. The band has very few songs from the 60's and the 70's, and they all sound like they

Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The instrumentation is amazing, the vocals are very good but when I first heard the lyrics I just thought WTF. This has got to be a joke. Why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song. I was extremely let down. It still gives me hope for the sound of this upcoming album. If the lyrics were any better this would be one the most badass songs ever.

Amazon review: COMPARED TO TAYLOR SWIFT'S CD, THIS REALLY SUCKS!

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good vocal in a pop rock band, and this is one of my favorites.  The lyrics are deep and personal.  The bass line is heavy and in your face.  If you are a fan of the 80's you will appreciate the hooks, but if you are a fan of alternative music you will just get a bad taste in your mouth with this one, but it's worth it.  I don't know if this guy ever thought about what it was going to sound like, but he just went for it, and that's what is so impressive about his voice.  He was able to express himself through words and music.  I give this album 4 out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Another great album from a great band, and again I'm very happy with this album.  The songs are very catchy, with a lot of heavy guitars and keyboards behind the vocals.

Amazon review: This is another great album from a band that is rapidly growing as a group of great musicians.  I've heard some good things about this album, although I always thought it would be too short.  I'm glad that I was wrong.  This band has a lot of talent and I'm excited to see where this band will go.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know I can't be the only one to think that this is a very bland and forgettable album.  I did however get the good feeling from the album that it is worth getting if you're into alternative rock.  I've heard some good things about this album, but I'm not sure how much of a fan I am of this band.  It's hard to put into words, but I've heard the guitar solos in the background in the background and it just made me feel like a little kid again listening to the original "Hooked on a Feeling."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very different album from the last one.  I was expecting a much more pop and upbeat album, and I was not disappointed.  The instrumentation on this album is amazing and I'm not sure if I like it enough to make the purchase.  The vocals on this album are really powerful but I just don't think that it is enough to warrant a purchase.  It's a great album, just not my style of music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album, but it's a little too simple for me.  It's a great album to listen to when you have a little while to kill.  It's great for when you're studying or you need an easy listening album.  I don't know how much good I can say about this album.  It's one of those albums that you just don't know if you should get it.

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's hard to say how much of a good thing this collection really is.  One thing I do know is that at least I'll have my favorite band's back catalog to listen to again and again.  There's no way I can say this collection does much to bring back the original sound of the band, though.   The songs are mostly new material, and they're a mix of oldies and new.  I can't really recommend this to anyone who really has any interest in the originals of the band, since those originals are few and far between.  It's an okay collection, but not much more than that.

Review: When I first heard that my good friends the Beach Boys were working on a new album, I was ecstatic.  I was truly looking forward to this album.  My first thought was, "I need to buy this CD."    The second thought was, "wait... they're not going to release this CD like they did before."     I was about to get my hopes up way too high.    I was going to be disappointed.      When all of the delays kicked in, and the album was finally announced, I was a little disappointed, but in a good way.   I've always loved the Beach Boys, and I was happy that they were finally releasing a new album.   I was excited.      As the months passed, I became a little less optimistic.  There were still no new songs from the new album, and I was starting to think I would never hear them again.       I was going to be devastated.       But then, on the day of the release, I was finally able to hear a few new songs.       My heart sank.   But then I heard a song called "Forever In My Life," and my heart sank, again.  But then I heard the final track, and my heart sank, just like before, but this time it was a little tighter.         I was hopeful, and for the first time in years, I was truly excited about the new album.        I was hopeful for the first time in years, and I was very happy to finally be able to hear an album from the Beach Boys that I grew up with, and that I knew and loved.          It was a little disappointing, but after all, I had been waiting so long, and I knew the new album was going to take a while.        It was a little disappointing, but I knew it was coming out, and I was happy to finally hear an album from the Beach Boys that I was really looking forward to, and that I absolutely adored.          Of course, I had to wait a little longer to finally hear the new songs, but I had faith the wait would be worthwhile.          And I was right.         The new songs are great.        They're great!            And you all know they're great, don't you?         You know they are.             I mean, you've known them forever, right?                And you'll probably never stop singing along to  <i>Forever In My Life</i>, you know?              And even though I know it's coming up a little bit later, I will be singing along to the new songs, and probably singing them again!               I know it's gonna be a little bit later, you know, but I'm excited.               It's gonna be a good album, isn't it?              It will be a good album, I promise.              I'll be singing along to the new songs, even though the songs are a little bit longer, and I'm a little bit older now, and a little bit sadder about my life than I was in 1986, so I'm gonna be singing along to the new songs, even though they're a little bit longer, and I'm a little bit sadder about my life now, than I was in 1986, so I'm

As the song develops it grows into a song with a more upbeat and lively feel to it. The band is playing extremely well with their excellent lead vocals and harmonies.

I listened to that tape until it finally broke after years and years of rewinding and replaying, so I was delighted to come across the digital version of this album on Amazon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The cd was just okay.  I'm from Chicago and I love house music but this was kinda lame.  A lot of the songs sound alike but the bass is booming!  I'm a dancer and I can only use about 3 of the 12 tracks.  I'm glad it didn't cost a lot.

Amazon review: I didn't realize that I had this song available to me until I saw it in the list of items that I supposedly "bought" and then when I read the other reviews and found out it is a free download I decided to listen to it. I listened for about 20 seconds, clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is. Yes, that IS why it is free!

Amazon review: I love this song.  You know, it's so simple and has such a great feeling to it.  It was so good to listen to while reading this review, it certainly would have helped if you had actually listened to the whole song while reading it.  I'm glad you didn't.  I did, however, like the whole review.  Thanks!

Amazon review: When I was younger, I was obsessed with the Little Mermaid, but then I got older and realized that I was a sucker for Disney movies.  I didn't give a damn about the story, I just wanted to see the fish swim around.  Now that I am older, I have realized that I love my family and I love my friends.  As long as I am loved and cared for, I will do anything for them.  So, I love this album because it reminded me that I need to love and care for my family and friends.  I love that I can have these things and still be at peace.  I wish you could have seen me singing this song with my kids in the kitchen singing along.  You know what I mean when I say I can't get no satisfaction.

Amazon review: My favorite songs are Lift Up Your Heads (I don't even know why it's on the list!), Halleujah and Every Valley.  I really like the whole album.  The music isn't for everyone, but I think it will be good for people who like old songs. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The CD is great.  I love the fact that the whole album is on CD.  I never liked CDs, but I like the idea of this album on CD.  The music is awesome and the artwork is also amazing.  I love the fact that the song "Come Away" is on CD.  I always have a hard time picking which songs to download, but I know I will download this album.

Amazon review: In the beginning, it was great.  I like it when a song is repetitive, which is one of the reasons I didn't like this CD.  But, after several listens, I realized that I didn't like it.  I don't like the songs, I don't like that they are repetitive and I don't like that the vocals are annoying.  I'd like to hear a song with better vocals to me.  I'm sorry, but I'm done with this album.  I don't believe anyone could sing this song.  I'm sorry, but this album is a waste of time for me.  I hope you enjoy the other albums that I bought, but this one is definitely over!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music is great for the most part.  I don't like anything in this album, but I don't dislike it either.  The songs remind me of music I loved when I was a kid, so it makes me happy to listen to it.  I'm not going to bother writing the song review.  I'm sure you know what I mean.  The story about the little girl that likes the sea and her mother who doesn't is very interesting.  I don't know if it is really true, but it is interesting.  The CD is very nice.  I like it.

Amazon review: I like how the chorus is saying something and then it plays over and over again.  I like the music in this album very much.

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is the perfect example of a  great song, a great album, and a great pop album.  This is one of the best pop albums of all time.  I say that because I listen to this album over and over and over and over again.  I love the sound of this album because it has a sort of early-80s  feel, but it also has a sense of coolness that makes it sound like  the 80's.  I would definitely recommend this album to someone that has a need for pop music. This album is fantastic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is probably the most underrated album of all time.  I think it's just as great as the first album but I don't think it has the same commercial appeal.  I think this album shows the most Elton John at his most confident and confident and confident.  It's a great album.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but I don't think it would be my favorite.  I think the songs get better on this album.  The songs are well written and the production is good, but the songs themselves are not very good.  They are not very memorable.  They are not very memorable and they are not memorable.  I know a lot of people love it, but I don't think it's my cup of tea.  I think it's a good album, but not a great album.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyrics go? While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").  Dan manages to save some of the album with "Off The Map" and "Fine," but once again, they lyrics are sub par.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most overused but least effective track on the album.  The music is good enough, but the lyrics are so corny and predictable that they fall flat.  The best song on the album is "I Don't Know Why", which just makes me think of an alternate universe in which the album is about the trials and tribulations of a man who decides to keep a cat as a pet.  The lyrics are "I don't know why, I'm still a virgin" and "I don't know why, I'm still a virgin"  It makes me think of an alternate universe in which the album is about the successes and victories of a man who makes millions of dollars after selling his body for sex.  The song itself is just a great example of why this album is a waste of time.  This is just bad music and bad lyrics.  "I Don't Know Why" is so boring and bad that I don't even know how they managed to pull it off.  It's a terrible song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song "I Don't Know Why" is the weakest song on the album.  It's a little corny sounding, but the rest of the album is pretty good.  The song "Draculina" is ok, and is better than "I Don't Know Why."  The song "Fine" is also pretty good.  "You're so much more than I ever was" is the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album a long time ago for my sister, but she never listened to it.  I finally convinced her to try it, and I think it's a great album.  The songs are just so different.  I am really looking forward to the live album "Live From Boston."  The reason I'm not giving the album 5 stars is because it's still a little weak in certain areas.  I could put a lot of the songs on here that would make the album a 5 star.  It's one of those albums that you need to have in your collection, because it's such a good album.

Amazon review: I was reading your review and I wanted to let you know that I own this album.  I bought it at a discounted price because I was afraid it was too long (it was from the first album).

Amazon review: I bought the album because I wanted to hear something that I had missed.  I think I'm going to buy the live album when it comes out, but I want to hear it for my next CD.

Amazon review: The song "Crazy" is the best song of the album.  The song "I'm Not A Child" is also a good song.  The song "I Don't Know Why" is one of the worst songs on the album.  It's corny and predictable.  I don't want to hear it anymore.

Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't realize blink 182 was still going until I got this.  I would suggest listening to their albums because this is not a bad song. I liked their old songs better, the sound was just different. I don't know, the vocals are fine, but the instrumentals are just plain awful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this song it's one of my favorite songs, and the video is also pretty cool.  I was a fan of blink 182 when they were known as 'blink' before they became blink 182.  When i heard they were turning into blink 182 i thought they would be better. I don't know why I thought that, maybe I'm just old but I think they lost their identity. When they started to play ballads, they sounded like a generic music group. I didn't have a clue what they were anymore.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the song and love the video.  I can't believe I never heard of this band but just found this out.  I'm a huge fan of blink 182 and the band is doing something right here.  Thank you for posting this song.  I loved it!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I love this song, but I wasn't sure if it was from the new album or not.  This band is great, it's just that the vocals are so over-the-top.  I don't know if it's just my tastes or not, but I like the sound more than the vocals.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of music lately and i've been really liking a lot of bands lately,  but  this one  was  a  little  too  much.   The  song  is  catchy  and  really  pretty  but  too  much  and  really  boring.  I'm  not  sure  if  it's  because  I'm  a  little  more  into  rock  or  the  band  or  because  i'm  just  a  little  more  into  the  band  or  because  i've  been  hearing  it  a  lot.   I  don't  know.   It's  just  too  much  for  me.    I  can't  even  listen  to  it   more  than  five  times.

Amazon review: I was in the middle of downloading this song and then stopped for a second because I had to go to the bathroom.   I'm not sure if it's because of the song but  this  song  is  really  lame.   Too  much  of  it.   I  hate  the  song  and  hated  the  video  at  the  same  time.  I'm  pretty  sure  that  the  song  is  not  from  this  album  so  i  really  wish  for  there  to  be  a  better  song  on  it.    But  its  definitely  worth  a  listen.    I  would  recommend  buying  this  album  if  you  like  music.    It  is  worth  it.    I  recommend  buying  this  album  if  you  like:    1)   music    2)    music    3)    music    4)    music    5)    music    6)    music    7)    music    8)    music    9)    music   10)    music   11)    music   12)    music   13)    music   14)    music   15)    music   16)    music   17)    music   18)    music   19)    music   20)    music   21)    music   22)    music   23)    music   24)    music   25)    music   26)    music   27)    music   28)    music   29)    music   30)    music   31)    music   32)

Amazon review: This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music? I'm serious.  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I was a fan of their first album, but I really liked this one.  I was a little disappointed about the album being a little bit overrated becuase it is a compilation of songs. But that was my issue with this one.  I know it's great, but it's a little overrated.  A little overrated in the way that the songs here are overrated.  Not all of her songs are great, but this is one of the best.  The songs are great, and the vocals are great.  However, I agree with the other reviewer that the songs are really just pop songs.  There just isn't anything else.  Other than the cover, which I like.  This is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes the pop sound that she has.  The album reminds me of those songs that were popular in the 80's.  I can't really explain why I like her so much, but I do.  I love her voice, and I love that she's a singer.  I would like to see her singing the songs that I like, but I just can't.  I like her other albums better, and she has much better songs on this one.  The only real flaw on this album is that the album is about 8 hours long.  I'm not going to judge, but just be honest.  I don't think I would really want to listen to this album more than once.  I think it's a really good record, but I wouldn't want to listen to it more than once.  I don't know about you, but I really don't have the time to listen to 8 hours of music. I'm sure you don't have the time for that.  But if you do, you should get the full album. It's worth the time.  I'm not saying this to be rude, but I just don't like her.  I just don't like her music.  I'm just saying that I'm not buying her albums anymore.  I'm going to stop buying them, and I'm going to listen to them if she ever sends me a demo.  It's not like I'm saying she is a bad artist, but I think she is just a pop singer.  I love the other artists on this album, but she is just a pop singer.  I'm not saying she is a bad singer, but I don't like her music.  I just don't like her music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a good album, but this is still a great album.  I don't know why anyone would listen to this album, because it's just another piece of pop crap.  I have been listening to this album for over a month now.  It has been three or four times that length, and I have not gotten bored of it.  This album is overrated, but it's still better than most of the records on the market.  I have to say though, that I am glad that I have this album on my iPod.  I'm not going to buy any of the other albums she has.  I'm not going to buy any of the other songs, and I'm not going to listen to them again.  I'm just going to stick with this one piece of crap.  It's better than the other piece of crap that I'm stuck listening to.  This is just one of those record that you'll only listen to once.  I don't think I will ever hear the song again.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this, but I'm not going to do anything with it, because I don't know what to do with it.  I have to listen to it over and over again because I don't know what to do with it.  I guess that's why I'm writing this, because I'm not going to listen to the rest of her albums.  I don't even wanna listen to the rest of her songs.  I don't know why I'm writing this, but I'm just writing it to tell you that if you like this record, then you should probably get the full thing.  I don't know why you would listen to this garbage, but you should listen to it.  If you like it, then get the full album.  This is better than other records out there.  This is the best record I have ever heard in my life.  This is the best album I have ever heard in my life.  This is the best album out there, and this is the record that I will never listen to again.  This is the best album that I have ever heard in my life.  This is the best album that I have ever heard in

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

This is a great review of a great album!

I love this song, in fact I listen to it every day, I just can't get over how amazing it is.

This is my second review of the album and the first of the great song. I know the song is really good and that Sarah is a great singer, but I have a problem with this album. There is no more song on the album, and in the notes they said that there was only 3 songs left but there was a new song called "No Man's Land" on this album. It started to make me a little nervous but I am still very happy because this is a great album.

This is a great album. I listened to the whole album in one sitting. I love the way Sarah sings so beautiful, and the way she writes. I think the new album is great as well. I did not like the last two songs but I am glad I heard them.

I think this is a great album but I would not recommend it to anyone who is not a music lover like me.

This is my second review of the album and the first great song in a long time. I love the song, I love the way Sarah sings so beautiful, and the way she writes, I love the song, I love the way the album is structured. I love the way the album is structured, but I didn't like the last two songs. I don't know why I didn't like them. I guess because I don't know the last two songs, I didn't know what to expect, so when they played the song "No Man's Land" I thought I wouldn't like it because it sounds like the last three songs. I am not a music lover, I am not a fan of music, I listen to a lot of music but I am not a person who likes to listen to a lot of music. But I do like to listen to great music, so I like the way this album sounds.

The first song is "A Whole New World", it is a love song, it is very hard to describe what it is about, it is a very good song. But this song is so beautiful, and it is a very good song, I love it.

The second song is "No Man's Land", I like this song but I did not like the last two songs. The last two songs are "When I'm in Love" and "All I can say about it is that it's very good". I like these last two songs, "When I'm in Love" and "All I can say about the song is that it is very good".

The third song "A Reason to be Hopeful" is a very good song, I like this song very much, it is a very good song.

The fourth song is "The Other Side" this song is very good, I like this song very much.

The fifth song is "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You" this song is very good, I like this song very much. It is a very good song.

The sixth song is "When I'm in Love" this song is very good, I like this song very much. I like this song very much. It is a very good song. I like this song very much. It is a very good song, I like this song very much. It is a very good song, but it is a very long song. It is a very good song.
