Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I got into this album, and even though I am a fan of it, it is not my favourite album of the year.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I have no words to describe this rubbish.  It's as if they took the words of the song and replaced them with the lyrics to the song "The Joker".  Not to mention they changed the words to make it so it sounds like the Joker was singing the song.  The song is about a guy who is very sick and when he goes to see a doctor he sees the Joker, he says "the doctor is a jerk, the Joker is a jerk, the Joker is the Joker, the Joker is the Joker".  This song is not even close to the original songs lyrics.  The original song was about a guy who had a lot of money and was very sick and when he went to see the doctor he had a lot of money but he was very sick and when he went to see the doctor he had a very sick wife and they went to see the doctor and he had a very sick child and they went to see the doctor and he had a very sick wife and they went to see the doctor and the doctor was very sick and the doctor was a jerk.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I know this is not her best work and she is in her mid-30's, but to write the lyrics like this and then have the nerve to turn on the radio and play it on the radio without a note of remorse is disgusting. You've got kids, why not write something meaningful? This is a song that should be in her repertoire and not just on the radio. Shame on you.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

I got to see him perform in several states in different venues. I was a little disappointed in the fact that they didn't play "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" or "Forever Young" but I was just relieved that they did "The Times They Are A-Changin" and "All I Really Want to Do." I would have rather seen them play "I Shall Be Released." That is what I'd ask to see on any other night.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

We are both a little older than she is, so we both play the piano, and I bought this one to help her learn the material, but also to practice.

The only thing that I really liked about this CD is that it includes "Gourmet" by Pink Floyd, which is a great song.

Amazon review: Not only is she a horrible singer.  She supports cop killers.  She is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video.  Please do not support her!

Amazon review: That is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased.  I will find something better.  Not worth it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What does a song have to do with any of this?  What does a song have to say about anyone or anything?  You are the one who brought this song into my life.  By purchasing this you are the one who is responsible for me discovering this song.  This song had no meaning to me and there is no reason to make anyone else listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: How sad is this?  I was told by someone who is in a better place that it was a very meaningful song to her.  Then she told me it was a very senseless song to her.  I told her it was sad.  Then she told me it was senseless.  What did it matter to her?

Amazon review: I was looking for a way to express how much I love the Beatles.  This song was the perfect way to do it.  It is one of the best and most meaningful songs ever written.  It has a message that speaks to so many of us.  I am glad that it did not come into my life until I had already discovered the Beatles.  I now know how important the Beatles were to me.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I think of the Beatles, I think of the songs we all grew up listening to, the songs that will always make us feel good.  I think that is exactly what the Beatles have done, but I don't think it has worked, and I think it is time to write a new song that is different from the Beatles.

It made me feel like I knew what was happening in the world.

Amazon review: I don't think you can possibly understand how I feel right now.  I love this song, and I love this album.  I can't believe I love the Beatles so much.  I remember when I first heard the Beatles, back in the early 1970's, all I wanted to do was listen to the Beatles.  Now I listen to the Beatles all the time, and I love them.  This is a very powerful album.
