Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: This is probably one of the best dubstep albums released in 2013. I will say that I am not a huge dubstep fan but this is one of the best dubstep albums I have ever heard. The vocal arrangement is fantastic, the drumming and the piano work really well in this track.

Amazon review: I love the dubstep mix that comes with this cd. It has a different sound than what I am used to, which is different from the tracks on the original compilation. The drums are slightly different, the bass is a different tone. It's a different dubstep mix. It doesn't sound like the original dubstep on the compilation. However, it's still a great dubstep track that is worth the extra money to buy.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I just bought this product on my way to the library. I was in the library for about ten minutes and then I decided to look up the price on amazon. I was shocked, as I had paid full price for it! I checked the price on amazon and it had been half price for the day which was very unfair. Then I decided to look at it again and saw it was on sale for ten dollars!!! I checked amazon again and it was still on sale. I checked the price on amazon and it was the same price, so I paid full price. The only thing I don't understand is that this was on sale for ten dollars and that was the price I paid for it in the first place.

Amazon review: I have been using this product for quite a while now, and it has really improved my sleep. There is one problem though, if I use this product on a full stomach, I must eat around 8 hours before bed. This is a bit annoying as I don't like to sleep late every night, so having to do this every night is a little annoying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was using this product for a couple of months and before that I was taking Ambien. When I started using this product I had no idea it was a sleep aid. I started using this product on the off chance that it might help me sleep. I would use 2-3 pills (I forget) and then I would wake up really groggy. Then one day I decided to go to the bathroom and I woke up in the morning and checked the pills. One of the pills was missing. I was so angry as I thought they must have taken it with them. I asked the sales person if they had taken it with them and she said no. She said that they didn't need the pills when they went on holiday and then went to bed. I was really angry. I thought they must have taken the pills and not put them in the bottle and then put them in the fridge when they got back. I was worried they would have forgotten about them when they went away.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say I have seen a lot of positive reviews for this product, but I don't like the fact that the bottle comes in a plastic bottle, and that I have to shake the bottle before I use it. The product is good, it works but there is a lot of it, and I have to shake it before using it. I would like to see it come in a glass bottle with a pump.

Amazon review: I love this product. I bought this on my honeymoon. I was amazed. I had been buying some of them for a while and had only had this one for a few weeks. It really helped me sleep at night, which I have never experienced before. I was on Ambien for several years and had only ever gotten the first level of this product. I now have the two levels and am very happy with them. When I take the Ambien it is the first level, I think it is the next new level for me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I have been using it for the past few months and it has helped me sleep very very well. It does not make me doze off but rather makes me feel relaxed. It works very well for me and I will continue to use it.

Amazon review: Ambien is the drug of choice for many. I used it for years and have become quite adept at mixing it with other pills so that I can get the effect I want without the side effects.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this many times and it sounds like they put it out as a reaction to the last one.  It doesn't help that the CD has some very annoying sounds.  But when the music is this good, well it's a pretty good CD. I don't give it more than 3 ticks  because I can't help but think that they could have used a bit more time in the studio and it would have been a very different record.  So I give it a 3.  I have no idea how they ever got this bad of reviews from people.  But I guess the good things in life are out there for everyone.  Good luck to all the rest of the bands that are trying to make good music.  I just hope Slipknot keeps making music because they are great musicians and are very good at what they do.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There is no doubt that Slipknot has improved a lot since the last time I saw them live.  They are better musicians, they have new songs, and their stage performance is better.  But I can't say the same for this album because it is just not that good.  Some of the songs on this CD are not that good.  I think that Corey's voice is better than some of the other guys' and I think that Jeff's guitar playing is ok when he is not on the guest list.  I can't say anything bad about this record.  I would recommend it to everyone.  So I give it 3 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: The version of the song is not my favorite. Unfortunately, I think this is the only version released. I even tried to find the song on the soundtracks of the National Lampoon Vacation movies but wasn't able.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed the music of Al Kooper.  But, I have to confess that "For those Who Wait" is not my favorite.  However, it is the only one I have heard so far.  I have had to put a "-" in the box.  It is my first time "reviewing" an album that I have not heard first.  However, I am aware that a lot of albums are sold without the first recording.  I have, however, listened to and enjoyed a lot of "first listen" albums.  I do know that this album is from the 'Classic' era of Al Kooper.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of Al Kooper since I first heard The Kooper Hour back in the early 80's.  I got lucky and got a copy of "For Those Who Wait."  I was not disappointed.  The sound quality is exceptional.  The vocals are great as well.  This is an excellent album.  It's a must have for any fan of Al Kooper.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon reviewer: I had not listened to Al Kooper in a while so I picked up this CD and loved it.  The album is well recorded with fine vocals, great rhythm guitar playing, lots of energy and great arrangements.  The guitar on the first song, The Kooper Hour, is phenomenal.  The guitar on the second song, When The World Gets Tough, is very different from most of the other Kooper albums and is a great example of this.  I will be buying the CD soon.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  From the moment I first heard it I knew that I would buy it.  Al Kooper has a great voice and plays guitar great.  The music is great.  The production is great on all of the songs.  I love the production on this album. It gives off a very old-school rock and roll vibe.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon reviewer: This is the first Kooper album I have had the pleasure to review.  I listened to the first two records as I was walking to work on several mornings and all of them are excellent.  The music is well played with great arrangements and the vocals are sweet.  I would say my favorite is the song "The Kooper Hour" which has an excellent guitar part by Gary Malloy.  The next song, "When the World Gets Tough" is the best of the Kooper albums.  It is a nice change from the slower, more mellow songs of his first two albums.  I have to say this is a great CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon reviewer: I am a little disappointed with this album.  I have heard it on one of those great bootlegs, but I want to hear this in complete quality.  It is a really good album, but I would not recommend it to anybody.

Amazon review: This is a really good album but it is not my favorite.  I am disappointed that I have not heard the whole album yet.  I am just a little disappointed because of the quality of the production and the vocals are really good.  The album is not my favorite of Kooper's but it is really good.  I will buy the whole album in the future.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I must admit that I am a "For Those Who Wait" fan, but this album does not seem to fit the criteria of my favourite Kooper albums.  I have been a fan of Al Kooper for many years and have enjoyed his work greatly.  This album is a pleasant surprise for me, but I have to say I am disappointed.  There are two songs that I enjoy, "When the World gets Tough" and "For those who wait".  Both are well crafted songs and both are very well played, but I am not feeling the same emotion that I have with previous Kooper albums.  This album has its place in my collection, but not on my favorites list.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I have been listening to Al Kooper since I was about 12 years old.  He is one of my favorite musicians.  I have listened to every one of his albums and this is the first one that I have not heard.  I have to admit that I am a little disappointed.  The production is very good, the vocals are really good and I enjoyed the songs very much.  I will buy the whole album again and listen to them all.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I just downloaded this album from Amazon and just recently finished it.  There are 11 songs on this tape, all of them are good songs.  This album starts off with some good, old-fashioned hip-hop, then moves into some country, and then the album ends on a song that was actually pretty good.  I would really recommend this album to everyone, especially the people that like music that has little to no production.  I would also recommend this album to people that like old-school hip-hop, country, and a little bit of rap.

I have listened to this album for about 2 hours, and I have been enjoying it.  The message on the song "God is Good" is one I have been thinking about a lot lately.  It is a great message that I have had in my heart for years, but I had not yet put into words.  I have read the Bible and watched the news, and I have come to the conclusion that the world is a very evil place compared to God.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I am not going to waste any time to write a review on this album, because I think it only deserves one. I think the first album of the band is the best - the second is pretty damn good, but it is pretty much a copy of the first one. I love it, just don't expect to be like it. Although, I have heard the first album before (I think I have listened it 5 times), so I can compare the two. But, for me, this is by far the best album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album every single day for the past two weeks. I have been listening to it a lot for this reason, because I am not going to watch any movie, because I listen to the album while I am watching the movie. I was just telling myself, you know what, this album is not a movie. You know, this album is not a movie and you know what? This album is just not a movie so I can get away with watching this album without the movie playing. The point is this, I think you should have to play this album while you are watching the movie.

Amazon review: This album was released in 2003 and features a mixture of songs from the albums, A Thousand Years, The World Beyond, and The Best of All Time. The album is one of the most played albums by the band. The album reached #1 on Billboard's album charts. Its success lead to the band's first Grammy Award win in 2004 for Album of the Year.

And then I noticed I was listening to it during my lunch break, and I couldn't stop thinking about what I was listening to, so I stopped what I was doing and went back to work.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: This is a very solid CD with a lot of songs worth listening to. However, I would like to point out some of the problems with the audio quality. The most noticeable problem is when the audio is in the background. The sound drops out and when it does, it is usually when there are cars driving down the road. I have the same problem with the video. I have the music on and the video on and I can hear the music in the background when I try to hear the video. I have to turn the volume down on the audio on my TV to make it go away.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In addition to many of the other negative comments here, I will add three things. First, it's easy to make a CD that sounds amazing when its music is turned up to 11. Then, when music is turned down, it looks and sounds fine. But, when music is turned up, the CD is full of pops and cracks. Third, this is a CD that sounds like it's not made by human hands.

Amazon review: For a lot of people, there are few things as annoying as the "tune in" commercials on TV. I have to turn my TV off after about an hour or so, then on, then off again, to not hear the annoying ads. When I go to listen to an album that has commercials on it, I don't turn it up to 11. This album was worth the effort of purchasing it just to hear the music. I would have gladly bought the CD by itself. If I had a CD player in my car, I would have done so. It's not the CD, but the commercials that make it such a pain to listen to.

Amazon review: One of my favorite albums of all time.  This one was a real treat to listen to.  The music on this disc is fantastic.  I had never heard of this group before, but when I heard the song "Smile" I knew that they were a group I would definitely want to buy a CD of.  I did and I'm glad I did.  The music on this disc is excellent, the lyrics are excellent, and the vocals are great.  I can't imagine why this CD was originally released in the late eighties and early nineties.  I know that it has been around for a long time, but I have never heard it until now.

Amazon review: This is some of the best music I have heard in years.  It is in a category with "The Beach Boys," "The Beatles," "The Rolling Stones," "Eddie Cochran," "The Band," and "The Rolling Stones."

###
Amazon review: I'm not one to give a negative review for a CD that does not deserve one, but this album is garbage.  This is the album that I bought the CD of.  I was only buying it because I already had the other two albums by this artist.  I could not believe that the CD had been sitting on the shelf for 5 years.  I guess I can't blame Amazon.  They probably made the CD and put it on the shelf.  I only have this one CD and I am not happy with it.  I am still trying to get my money back, but I'm not giving up.  I will try again when I have more money.

Amazon review: The only reason I wanted to order this recording was because the artist recorded under the moniker of "The B.U.G.s" which was one of my favorite artists when I was in middle school.  Then I learned that they were from Florida.  This CD is a compilation of three of their songs "B.U.G.s," "I Love U," and "I Want You."  I was really hoping to find a CD of all four songs on the same disc.  I did not find that, but I did find a compilation of three of the four songs on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is another CD that has a lot of great tracks.  You have to be a real music lover to enjoy this disc.  This CD is a compilation, but there are a lot of good songs on it.  If you are a fan of old school rock, this is the CD for you.  This CD is for the person who can take a lot of different types of music and enjoy it all.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is for your hard drive.  It is not for your CD player.  The song selection is better than anything I have heard from them.  And you cant even hear the music in this one.  The songs are too short for me to listen to them the way I want.  I hope they can come up with a better disc soon.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really enjoy the music here and the lyrics are very interesting.  However, the CD is not for me.  It's not worth the $99.  This is a terrible product for such good music.  I feel it is not worth the purchase price.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Slipknot since the beginning and this is my third CD with them.  I love them and I love to listen to their music.  This CD is great.  The songs in here are great.  I can even tell there are more songs on this CD.  I am not sure why it's not as good as the other two.  The songs are great and the music is great.  This is a very well done album.

I am so glad to see this album, I think this is the best album the band has put out.  It's a great mix of rock and pop rock.  I love the lyrics in this one.  I listen to this all the time and it is a great album.  I really wish it was longer because I love the songs.  I think this is the best album the band has put out.

Amazon review:  I bought this CD at a garage sale for $2.00.  Now that I have it, I am thinking about selling it for a much higher price.  The songs on this CD are very weak, but overall, I like the music.  However, I would not buy this CD if I was going to sell it.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone, but I will tell people about it.  I will definitely be buying the Slipknot album soon.

Amazon review: This is a very good "album" to put on your iPod.  It's not the best music on this iPod, but it is good enough to listen to while driving.  However, it's a very long CD, so it won't take up too much room on your iPod.

Man of La Mancha

I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it
did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.
I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De
La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the
show out there.

Sounds like old school Veruca Salt.
Recommended.

Amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous albums. Monotonic un imaginative songwriting and arrangements.

I can't rate this! It did not
