Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great band.  The only complaint I have is that they don't do much promotion.  I tried to order through the Amazon  website but it took forever to get a response on the  payment page.  I finally got a response from a customer service rep,  who actually  apologized and  said that he could not take care of the problem.  He was actually very polite and kind and I thought he took the time to do the right thing.

Amazon review: I went to this show as a last-minute replacement for my brother.  I was very impressed with the band and the set list.  I had never heard of this band before.

I'm not saying this  band is as good as The Clash but I will say that they're good.

Amazon review: I was an early fan but i got tired of the mediocre.  I heard this band and thought that they were too cheesy for me to enjoy but after hearing them for about 3  weeks i finally get into them.  This is a band that you just don't want to diss.  The drummer is really good and the band is very good.  I think that they will grow into a great band.  I hope they will be able to keep this up.  The one thing i dislike about this band is that they are still growing and have not even released an album.  I think they should start recording but they should stay true to their sound and stop copying other bands.  I hope that they will have another album soon.  The band is really good and the drummer is really good.

Amazon review: I love the band.  I have been following them since they started
and they have a unique sound that I like.  The lead singer has a great voice
and the guitar player is a great improviser.  They have a new album coming
out in February called "Grown".  I hope they will do well in the future.  I
really liked the setlist.  They play a lot of classic rock and roll songs
that I like.  The sax player is a top notch improviser and really fun to
hear.

Amazon review: What a mess!  It's a shame, because the first CD did not have any bad reviews. One reviewer said it sounded like "a terrible mary jane song."  Now, a review on Amazon says: "This album sounds like a really well-composed mary jane song."  If anyone can tell the difference between the two, please let me know. But what the heck, I'll take a chance.  I'm not going to be happy until I see a review where no one can agree with me. Until then, I'll just stick with my judgmental opinion, and I'll always have the CD.  I think Meghan Trainor is pretty good. I think she has some great potential. I think she has talent, and I think she is going to be a star.  I do not think she is going to be a star.  I think she is going to be a pop hit.  She has a great voice, and she can sing.  I think she has a great personality.  I think she is too beautiful for rock music.  I think she is a great actress.  I think she has great sex appeal.  I think she has a great sense of style.  But I think she is too young and not good enough for rock music.  I think she is great in the movies, but I don't think her music is good enough for rock music.  I think she has a great voice.  But I think her musical ability is a little overrated.  I would rather listen to her song than any other artist.  I would rather listen to her songs than any other artist.  But I think she should have waited until she was older to try to make a career in music.  I think she is too young and not good enough for rock music.

The first time I listened to it, I was surprised by the sound quality.  The vocals are really clear and clear.  The songs are very well put together.  It is a different type of singing.

I guess I just really like this type of singing.  I don't know what to say, I really like the album.  I don't think this album sounds like a mary jane song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I love this song.  The only downfall is that the last track on the album is just horrible.  I wish it was a cover of the song by The Beach Boys.  But I know I am a fan of this band so I will give it a pass since I don't like this album anyway.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't understand this song.  I don't know who it is but it sounds like someone from the band The Beach Boys.  I don't know why they sing the lyrics about the beach at the end of the song as though it is a beach in a desert.  The band I am referring to is The Beach Boys.  It is a band from the 1960's.  They are not in touch with what is going on now.  Their music is pure and simple and I am sure it was meant for kids who like simple things.  I wish it was a cover of this song that I had bought a long time ago.  It is a cover of The Beach Boys song "Good Vibrations".  That was meant for pop music but I have never heard of it until now.  It is a very good song by The Beach Boys.  And they did do a cover of this song.  I want to hear more of this song.  It is very good.  I love all the songs on this CD.  They are all very good and I am very impressed.  I will certainly buy a copy of this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the first half of the song.  The song is simple but very catchy.  The second half is not as good.  I heard this song on the radio.  It is a great song.  I love the song.  I really wish I could hear some more of this song.

Amazon review: I have a few of his albums, mostly on vinyl, but I am not a fan - these songs are a waste of time.  This album is worth the money if you want to be able to listen to pop/rock, but if you want to hear the songs together you will be bored.  I have other albums where I have been able to listen to them together, but I still like this album less.  I am getting sick of it.  I like these songs, but the album just isn't good, it has no soul.

I love this album. It is the way I like to listen to music. I do agree that some of the first songs are not the best, but this is mainly because of the poor mix. However, the whole album is good and worth buying.

I agree with you on alot of the stuff, but i have to say that I like the album a lot. The vocals are nice and are very catchy. There is a good mix of styles on this album. I like it and the lyrics are very good, but the first couple of songs have a poor mix and i think it was done to make them better.

I have to say that this is my fav album. The songs are really great, and it has a good mix of both old and new songs. But I have to say that the mixing of the songs, and the mixing of the guitars and some of the voice is very poor, and it makes it sound terrible. It also has the worst mix of the guitars that I've ever heard. The mix of the vocals is also really messed up, and also, it sounds like they recorded it on their home stereo instead of in the studio. But overall, I like this album a lot. I think it is one of the best albums of all time.

I have to say that this is one of the best albums of all time. The vocals are very good, and the mix is very good, and there is a very good mix of different styles. I really like the album, and I think it is one of the best albums of all time.
The best songs are "Hangman" and "The End", and the second best songs are "You're Gonna Learn" and "Slash". There are many great songs on this album. I think it is really awesome. I really love the vocals on this album.

I think this is an excellent album. The vocals are very good and the mix is great. There are many great songs on this album. It is very good. I would recommend it.<|endoftext|>

I think I have found a new favorite CD. I would just like to say I have to say that I love these boys and am so happy I bought this CD for my kids. I have a son who is 12 and this is the type of stuff that he wants to listen to. I am so glad I bought this CD for him. I think I have a new favorite CD. It's a great CD and I recommend it to anyone. If you are a parent, please take the time to listen to Liberata's children and tell us what you think.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I love these guys.  They are one of the hardest working bands I've been able to find.  It would be very hard, however, to find a band that's so much fun and works so hard.  I've been a fan since about '86.  I'm glad they don't have a record out yet.

Amazon review: I have to admit, this album is a little different from their previous work.  I just bought them when I moved to the area and I love to listen to them as much as I can.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  I wish I could say I listened to this CD for the first time, but I was listening to it for the first time (and only the first time) in a long time. This CD was so much fun to listen to, I couldn't stop. I have always been a really big fan of the music of David Bromberg, and I was thrilled when he decided to perform the entire opera (with the exception of Act 1 of my favorite song) with the Royal Swedish Opera.  I have never seen this opera, not even once, so I was a little apprehensive about seeing it live.  It was even more exhilarating than I had thought it would be.  The singing and orchestra was incredible, and the entire performance was well worth the price of admission.  I would recommend this CD to anyone, especially those who are a fan of David Bromberg, The Royal Swedish Opera, or just good music and singing.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful collection of songs for any fan of David Bromberg. I loved that I was the only one in the family who had heard these songs before. I also really like that you can find many different versions. I've never heard this before but I have bought the David Bromberg CD's ever since I was a kid. I enjoy listening to them. I believe each song is different so you can find a song that will fit your mood at the time. The CD is great, but I really liked Act 1 of The Snow Queen best. I have never listened to Bromberg before so the CD was a new experience for me.

Amazon review:  My daughter is a fan of many of the artists on this CD.  She loves all the music.  She loves to sing along to the songs.  Although she has a very good voice, and is a singer in her church choir, she was disappointed that the lyrics were not in English.  She had to have them checked out to see if there was an English version.  She also did not like the fact that on 2 songs, the words were in French.  I thought this was pretty bad.  She also said there was not a single verse or chorus in English.  It seemed as though the lyrics were put in as a way to appeal to the parents of the youth.  The chorus in French was not that bad, but when I went to the actual lyrics, they seemed to be in French,  I do hope she comes back and listens to the music.  I am hoping to get this CD, so I will be able to give it a try.

Amazon review: I was really hoping to find a CD that had all the songs I love.  This CD was disappointing.  I purchased the CD hoping for some special songs, but I really didn't see any.  The CD has many songs I love, but I wish they had special songs in it.  I do know that there is a special CD that has special songs, but it just didn't seem to be on this CD.  I would have bought it if it had special songs.  I wish I had a special cd.  I know I have a special cd.  I just don't have the money to buy it.  I am sorry.  Thank you for your service to the Lord and your ministry.  I am looking forward to hearing the songs again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This album is supposed to showcase a new band. Not be a rehash of their previous work. The band was actually quite good. I bought the album because I was looking for a new band to listen to. I'm so glad I did. It was a great experience. The band sounded great. The lyrics were good. The music was great and I think that the band could have gone much further but at times their sound just didn't come together. I just wish the band would have stuck with their sound instead of moving on to another sound that was just as good. I still think the band could have used a little more time to develop a sound that worked. I give this album a 4 out of 5.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is not your typical "oldies" album. It is a different kind of album in the fact that it is not just music for the people of the 60's or 70's. It is a music album about the people of the 60's and 70's. That was the whole point. This is a music album that is for people that grew up without the Internet and the music that comes out is not always to their taste. The music here has a very special sound and it is very good but not perfect. Some of the songs are very good and others are not. The only music style that was consistent was that of the 60's and 70's folk music that you would find on the radio. The first 3 songs are all about the 60's and the first two songs are about the 70's. Those three are the only songs that were consistent in style and the rest of the songs are very mixed. So if you like the 60's and 70's then it might not be for you. If you like the 60's and 70's then it might be something for you. I really like the music and the album overall. I like the music very much. There are a lot of songs here that I like and some that I do not. This album could have been much better.

There is a lot of good music on this album that I have not heard before like "The Greening of Winter" and "The Lonesome Cowboy" which has been recorded by many artists. The only thing I do not like about this album is that it gets very repetitive at some of the songs. I would have liked to have a little variety and not have all the songs be exactly the same. I can only assume that this is the reason why it is not a "filler" album.

I think this is a lame album... not worth the $24.99 (even if you don't mind buying CDs for a price that is 1/3 less than most iTunes downloads).  I know the guy who rips this off from. He's a real punk rocker with a real sharp tongue and doesn't give a s**t about what he's ripping off.  This album is nothing more than a bunch of rappers ripping off other rappers and it sucks.  I'm not gonna pay for this crap... I'm just going to listen to it in my car as I drive... as I listen to it as I drive to work.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
