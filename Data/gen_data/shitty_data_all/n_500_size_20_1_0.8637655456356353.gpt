Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: This really is a piece of work.  It's a mix of acoustic and electric music.  I found it to be very interesting and I think that it will also have a lot of people enjoying it.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I thought this was a great album! I bought it for my wife who is a huge Cher fan. I listened to it on my Ipod. She loved it! But, she was expecting this album. When I got the CD it was extremely dirty. I had to buy another CD and listen to it through my CD player. I called Amazon the next day and was told by a customer service rep that the CD was damaged, but they would send me another one for free. I called back the same day and told her that I had already bought the CD and that I no longer had it. She took it to her manager and the manager said that they would refund me the money I paid to buy the CD. She was a little mad but I told her that I had already paid for it. She apologized for the mistake and I was told she should have gotten it back from me. I called them back and gave them the money for the CD and they said I would have to pay the money back. I told her that since I didn't get it back from her she could have it. I explained to her that there was no way I would buy this album again, and now I was paying for it. She said that she would take the CD to a jeweler and get it fixed. She said that I had to send it back to her. I told her that she could send it back to me. She told me that I would have to pay for it again. So I told her that since I didn't get it back I could have it. She asked me for my address and she sent me a CD with a note from the jeweler saying that he would fix the CD for free. I was very mad and told her that I would never buy another album from them again. They are a company that doesn't deserve my business.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: This CD is not for the faint of heart.  It takes a lot of time and effort to truly get into this CD.  But I think that will be worth it.  There are a lot of tracks that are very catchy and have a good beat.  The songs that leave a lot to be desired are the ones that lack a strong message and are just songs that you can sing along to.  The message is not strong enough and the lyrics are not meaningful.  You will find yourself wishing that you could take this CD and turn it into a happy and fun song.  If you are looking for a track to sing along to, this is not the right CD for you. But if you are looking for a song to listen to with your friends and family, this CD is perfect. I myself am going to buy it because I have heard of it and I am going to enjoy it.  It is a great CD to have as a gift for your family & friends, that will help them have a good time in any gathering.

There are a few songs that had a message in them, but they were so bad that they were just songs that you can't sing along to.  There was a song that I really liked from the CD that was called "In the Beginning", which was a very good song.  It has a great beat and it has a message.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. Really takes me back to that time, really good song.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I am a huge "Aerial" fan.  I have to admit, I didn't think this album was going to be as good as his previous work.  It wasn't, but I didn't expect it to be.  It is just a really bad album.  The singing is terrible, the songs are all very samey.  I mean, how can you call "Rope" a really good song, when it is just the same basic song all over again?  "The Day We Started" is a really good song, but the rest of the album is just not worth listening to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Although I have never heard a CD by the Newsboys, I was a huge fan of their music since they first came out.  This is their latest album and I am so glad that they decided to give us some new material.  I have to admit, the songs sounded good and the band sounded good.  The problem was, I was expecting a lot and instead, I got a load of same old tired stuff, and honestly it is awful.  I would buy this one, if it was only the music, I don't need this album.  I will listen to it once though, to give it a chance, and then I will forget about it.  I will just stick with my old stuff from them though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good album for a first time country album. So far, I don't know what albums this reviewer has heard that sound more country than this one.  I have to admit, I listened through this album a bit and I have to say that, it has some real good songs on it. Even "I Want a New Man" was very catchy and had plenty of potential.  The problem is, that it just doesn't make any sense to listen to.  It is all over the place, it is not cohesive in any way, and it just has no real redeeming value.  I would like to give it a pass, but the more I listen to it, the more I want it to go away.  I would not call myself a fan, but I just wish the band would get their act together.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to honestly admit that I liked this album much more than I thought I would.  This is the second album of this group.  I was excited for them to have a new album, but I was not expecting this one to be any good.  I found the songs very catchy and well written.  The songs just get better and better, I love them.  This was the first country album that I have listened to in a long time, I am really glad that I listened to it.  I have to say, that I think it has a lot of potential, although I think the music itself is very repetitive.  I am not saying it isn't, but the songs are repetitive and I just don't care for it.  I would give it a good chance and I will probably listen to another album from them, but I think if they don't start focusing on music, they will not be as successful as they should be.  They need to just do whatever they want to do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the music of this band, but I always thought that the band members were the same.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  They are all fantastic musicians and they sound great together.  However, there was a problem with the writing.  I am not saying that it is not written well, I just don't agree with the lyrics that they are using.  I have to admit, I would like to hear more songs like this, but I don't like the songs.  I would not buy it, but you can't help but listen to it because they are pretty good.  My only complaint about this album, is that they have been doing the same songs for a while now.  I don't know why they are doing this, but they always have been.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is good, but it is not as good as the last album that they put out.  I really liked their previous album, so I was expecting a lot from this one.  On the first listen, I really liked it.  The songs were very good, I really liked the band and I thought the album was very good.  The one thing that I noticed though, was that they had the same songs over and over.  It was a little boring to listen to.  I don't know if it is because of the writing or the music, but I just found that it was repetitive.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wish I didn't have to listen to this terrible CD. If you like the sound of this band, I recommend you to listen to "Hear It All Before" (which is on my top 50 favorite songs of all time list), and you should also listen to "The Love Is Mine" (a great song by the way). However, if you hate this band, I recommend you to listen to "A Heart Full of Love" (which is also my top 50 favorite songs of all time list), and "See You Again" (which is another one on my list of top 50 favorite songs of all time list). If you are someone who likes female voices, you shouldn't listen to this CD.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song by Kelly Price, I thought it was a cover. I was wrong. This is a new song by Kelly Price and she has a wonderful voice. Her voice is angel-like in the way it has the power to make you feel in love with her. As a singer, she's one of the best. I'm glad she sang this song since I love her, and I hope you too, will love Kelly Price's voice as much as I do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you like Kelly Price, I highly recommend you to buy her latest cd, entitled "Hearts & Loves". She doesn't have a very good voice, but she has a great voice and she makes this song in such a way that it is really beautiful and a masterpiece of singing. She also does other songs on the cd that are really great although she does not have a very good voice for them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Kelly Price has had a very successful career in the music industry for many years now. She is a really talented singer, songwriter, and performer. She has a wonderful voice and has performed on stage with such artists as Lenny Kravitz, Keith Urban, Lyle Lovett, and more.

Amazon review: I'm really not into Kelly Price, and I have never heard her hit song "See you again". However, her voice is not really bad at all. Her voice is really beautiful, and she has a great voice. She has been a very successful singer ever since she started out and she has a very nice voice. I just don't think she is a very good singer since she has such a nice voice.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've only heard Kelly Price's songs "Hearts & Loves" and "Heart Full Of Love", and I've heard her sing on "You are one of my best friends".

Amazon review: I had never heard of Kelly Price before I found out she was a singer and a songwriter. I was amazed when I saw her on her first album, and I was amazed when I saw the video of "you are one of my best friends" (she was also on the video for "hearts & loves"). She has a very beautiful voice, and I can't wait to hear her sing on her new cd "hearts & loves".

Amazon review: Kelly Price is really a very talented singer and she has a very beautiful voice. She always has a hit song on albums and she is a very good singer.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you really like Kelly Price, then you should buy her latest cd "hearts & Loves", which contains two songs called "Hearts & Loves" and "Heart Full of Love". They are also great ballads. Kelly Price has a very beautiful voice and she makes these two songs in a very angelic and beautiful way.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is Kelly's second cd, and she's done a very good job on this one. I really like the songs and the music is very good. I really like the way she sings and the way she writes the songs. I really love Kelly's voice, she has a very nice voice.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

His voice is wonderful and he's always had a smooth singing style.  This disc is a great follow up to his previous disc: All That is a must buy.  It's a little less polished than his previous collection, but it's still a wonderful collection of songs.  But this collection is a lot more polished and has songs that are more "funny" in my opinion.  I feel like there are more songs for the guys to sing than just "girl's night out" type songs.  I guess I just don't like Josh Eustis.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review:  This is one of the best songs on the album, and is definitely worth it.  It's a great rock song with a great melody.  It's also one of the few songs that is really full of emotion in the sense that it really tries hard to describe the emotional state of a person who is experiencing a life changing event.  The lyrics aren't particularly good.  But it's the most uplifting song on the album.  It's a little like listening to someone else's dream, a very sad and emotional song.  The vocals have a very strong, emotional effect on the song.  It's very emotional and I felt very moved by this song.  I love this song.  It's a very good song, and I would recommend it to anyone.  It's one of the best songs on the album.  I would give it a 9.5/10.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The only thing I don't like about this song is the repetition of the chorus.  I would've preferred that the second chorus sounded different.  I mean, the first one is pretty great, but the repetition kind of takes away from the song.  I think it would have been better if they had sung it, "No matter what you do to me, I will always love you."  I mean, I get it, but it would have been better.  This song is very good.  I'm sure it will be one of the most played songs on the radio for the next few years.  I give this song 8/10.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are a few things going on here that don't exactly make sense.  For instance, the song starts with a heavy metal guitar riff that then transitions into something that sounds like a jazz riff.  Then the guitars return.  It would've been better if they had a bit more of a change in pace.  But it's not the worst song on this album.  Its a very good song.  I give this song a 8 out of 10.

When I heard the album I immediately thought back to the songs that I remember from when I was a kid.  Most of the songs are very similar to those I grew up with.  I like that they've combined the two genres of music I love, and made it sound new and fresh.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I'm very excited to see the group as they are a very good band and I'm sure once they get in front of people they will be very popular.  I will be buying the CD as soon as the shipping is done.  The band will be playing at the Voodoo Lounge on December 4th.  Please be there, there are going to be some great people there.

Amazon review: I'm not sure that they will be able to duplicate the magic that is The Strokes.  I'm sure that they are great, but I don't know if they will be able to pull off the same thing that The Strokes have been able to accomplish.  They just seem to meander a little too much.  I really like the cover of "New Wave" by The Strokes.  I really like the cover of "All Of This Could Be Yours" by The Strokes.  I really like "Strokes" by The Strokes.  They are going to be great, but I just don't know if they can duplicate the magic that is the Strokes.  They just seem to meander a little too much.  They just seem to meander a little too much.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: This is not a good app. I have to turn it on 3 times every time I want to play a track. Then I have to wait for the song to play for about 30 seconds before I can use it. When I want to listen to something else I have to press the "play" button. It is not very convenient.

Amazon review: I LOVE THIS APP. I will use it every day. I am so grateful I found this app. My wife and I listen to music together and for that we need a better way to listen to music.

Amazon review: I have been listening to music, mainly from my ipod. I love the sound of the ipod, but the problem is I have no app that will let me play my music with it, so I have to go into my ipod to listen to it. I am using this app and it is perfect! Thanks for the great app!

Amazon review: I have tried to listen to music on my ipod and my ipad, but I could not get it to work. I have tried the free version, the paid version, and the free version w/ no ads. I still can not make it work. I have never used anything other than the free version. The free version with no ads is $1.99, the paid version is $2.99, and the free version w/ no ads is $2.99. I am sure this is an old free app and I haven't updated it since I started using it, but it is still worth it to me.

Amazon review: I have had an ipod for 5 years, and now I am buying an ipad. I could not believe it when I tried to use my ipod for listening to music. I tried many apps that were out there. But, none of them worked well. So, I looked it up and found this app. I thought it was great. It makes it so you can listen to your ipod with the ipad. I like it a lot and will be buying a new ipad as soon as possible. Thanks for the great app.
