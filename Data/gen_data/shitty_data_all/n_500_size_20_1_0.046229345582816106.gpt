Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

If you want to purchase the CD, I'd tell you first that the cd is not in the book, and that the book is a gift. I bought the book to give to my dad and mom for Christmas, but they didn't want it, so I got the cd. I also read the book to my son, who is now 15, and he really enjoyed it. I got the cd for my son to give to his dad.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Vai since the 90's.  I've always been impressed with his musical ability and I've always felt he was "too close to the edge."  I hope he finds a way to return to the musical roots he's been exploring.  I hope he does something that's not so over the top as his previous work seems to be.  I don't know what he's going to do next..  This is his first album in over a decade.  We need a little more than what he's been doing to keep us fans.

##  The Vai Team

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Vai's music for years. I find it ironic that I've become so frustrated with his music over the last decade.  I have a feeling I will be very disappointed.  I love the music and the creativity, but I don't like the direction of his music.  I feel it is not authentic to the music and to the music of his previous albums.  I'm sure the CD is very good, but it's not the last album.  I will wait to see what happens with the new album, and if he stays true to the music, then I'll purchase it.  If he doesn't, then I'll continue my support of the music of Vai.

Amazon review: I'm an old fan of Vai and have been for a very long time.  I love the music and his new album is very good.  I am a fan because he seems to be trying to break away from what he has done in the past with his previous albums.  I have a feeling I will be very disappointed.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What a waste of time this is.  Good for some people, but for me this doesn't work.  Not a single track is memorable, and the overall effect is just bland.  The vocals are decent, but they don't make up for the music.  What is the point of going into all these unnecessary ideas and taking two minutes to finish a song that should take about twenty minutes to complete?  I'm sure most people are familiar with the main idea of the song, so why waste two minutes to tell a half-baked story about it?  The worst part is, the song was actually good at the time, but now it just sounds like everyone forgot to tell the story properly.  So, I'm sure it's a great song, but it's just a terrible album.  I'm sorry, but this is embarrassing.  It sounds like the band is just recycling the same ideas over and over.  I'm not sure what the point of this album was, but at least it looks like they're trying to make people happy, which is more than I can say for a lot of other death metal bands.  I'm not saying that this is the worst death metal album of the year, but I'm only rating it at half of a point.  I think this album should be two points.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this was a good album.  It has a couple of nice tracks, like the title track (a couple of minutes of good metalcore) and the last song, "Deadly Sin."  The song "Purgatory" is just awful.  You can't even take a listen to it without immediately having a feeling of defeat.  I mean, there are a couple of good tracks here, but the whole album just feels like a joke.  I just don't understand how people could buy something like this and think it's good.  I mean, this is the kind of song that should be good, but it just doesn't work.  I have a lot of fun with this album, but I just don't think it's good.  I'll give this album a three-point rating, but it's just not worth anything.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is so bad, it's good.  I mean, the song "Purgatory" is awful.  But the song "Dying to Live" is really, really good!  That's what I call a "great" song.  If you're a fan of metalcore, then give this album a listen.  But if you've never heard metalcore before, then it's not worth your time.  I'm not really sure what happened here.  It used to be a good album, and now it's just a horrible waste of time.  I don't think this album should get any points out of it, but I do think that I'll listen to it once and then forget it.

Amazon review: Another excellent album from the same band, and another album that I really enjoy.  "A Night To Walk" is a fast song, but that is what is needed here.  It's a fast song, and it really gets the crowd pumped up.  The other two tracks are really good, and I enjoy them all.  "Purgatory" is a great song, and I enjoy it a lot.  It's a really fun song, and it's really hard to stop listening to it.  "Burden" is a good song, but it's not really fast enough for me to put it up against the other two tracks on this album.  It is a good album though, and I enjoyed it a lot.  This band really knows how to make an album that's a complete, positive experience.  It's nice to have a band like this that really knows how to make an album that has a balance of fast songs (like "Purgatory") and slower songs (like "A Night To Walk").  The main reason why this band is good is because their songs are really well made, and they really know how to write a good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought the song "Burden" was one of the best songs on this album.  It has a really nice melody, and it's fast.  The band does a good job of building a good atmosphere with this song, which is probably one of the best things that can be said about this album.  If you're a fan of death metal, then give this album a listen.  I don't think I could pick a favorite song from this album, but "Burden" is definitely up there.  I also really like "Purgatory," and it's

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

This has been one of my favorite movies of all time, I really loved it! I really enjoyed the music, it was just what I needed. I would say it was a bit dark at times, and very intense. I would say that it was a little scary, but not as scary as the movie they had made. The movie was suspenseful and it made me fall in love with this movie. The music was just what I needed! I would say that this movie was just great. A must see, I'm looking forward to seeing it again.

Amazon review: I have an interesting theory about this song. I believe that the reason it is bad is because it is completely devoid of melody. The chorus is very repetitive with a very minimal melody. It has absolutely no interesting rhythm or bassline. The melody is so repetitive and so short that the song just falls apart. The only time you can find the instrumentals to make the song interesting is in the second half where you can hear the piano. I find this song extremely uninteresting and terrible.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This record contains a lot of good songs that would make a great album. But it really is just a bunch of filler songs. I like the first and last songs, but they're so repetitive and boring that I have no interest in listening other than the first two.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the band Switchfoot. I like the songs, I like the style, and I like the band. But I don't like this album. It's just too much of the same. I didn't like the songs on the first album, so I don't know why I'm being so picky now.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This is a song that I didn't like very much when I first heard it. After I got used to it, it became one of my favorites. I only wish that there was a version with an even stronger kick. The opening riff is very catchy for the most part, but the rest of the song is pretty bland.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a little bit like The White Stripes, but they play the songs in a different style.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is great. I really like it! I thought I was going to like this song, but it just didn't do it for me. I was really disappointed. I was going to buy this song because I liked how it was played in the movie The Lion King. I think this song would be great for the movie, but it just wasn't for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is the worst song in the whole entire movie. I would not even like to see this song played in a movie. I mean, the Lion King has the best soundtrack in the movie, but this song, I would say, is the worst. It just plain sucks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.
