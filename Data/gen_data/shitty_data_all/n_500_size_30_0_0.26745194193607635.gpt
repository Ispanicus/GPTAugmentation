Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This is a great cd.  I like the voice and the sound.  The lyrics are pretty good as well.  Its not the best but its definately a good cd.  The song "How you doin baby" is a little different.  Its a little different than the song on the original cd.  I think the original cd is a little better.  They are both good.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: This song is really good, but I have to say I don't like the song. It's not that I don't like all of their songs, I just don't like this one. I think that people who are into creeper style music need to stop listening to the songs because they are all very similar to each other. I don't like the song because I think it is a little bit slow to the point of being boring. I like the song, however, because I like the style of the song.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: There's no two ways about it: Cher is back. After all, she started her solo career with that song, "Believe". And the song was number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for 11 weeks. This album is the follow-up, and it is simply amazing! She's singing about life, and about relationships. The album is filled with songs of love, and she sings about everything from a girl who has a crush on a boy, to the woman who is in love with her boyfriend, and the woman who is in love with her man, and the woman who is in love with her man.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I listened to this cd at a meeting with an audience of 5-6 at a local business I attend. I started the cd in the middle of the meeting. Everyone I met was very pleasant and listening to the cd was perfect. This cd had a great, professional sound. It was very clear, but not too loud. It lasted for about 15 minutes. I can't say that it was perfect, but it was good. I have to say I was disappointed with the CD itself. It had a strong, but not too loud, noise. It was clear but not loud. I would have given it better, but it was not worth the money.

Amazon review: I am a new owner of this computer, but my cd player died and now I have a new one that I got for free from my parents. I am trying to get my brother to get me a cd player for christmas. I have looked at the audio cd's in the store and this one is the first I have heard that I thought was good. It is very clear and loud for the most part. The only bad thing I can think of is that the speakers are small and they get muffled very easily. I will have to get them some more speakers.

Amazon review: Audio CD of music from the movie "The Lion King" This is the first cd I have ever bought from Amazon.com. I have been using cd's for over 20 years, but this is the first I have ever bought that was on CD quality, not just mp3. When I was at the library, I tried to load the cd, and it wouldn't read, or I couldn't understand the title of the track. I have a small, portable cd player, and I tried to load it, but it wouldn't read. I don't know what the problem was, but I was very disappointed. I bought this cd because I thought it was the kind of music I would like when I was in the car, listening to music. I had my doubts, but at first I thought, oh well, it isn't bad. I took it home, and played it on the car stereo, and I am pleasantly surprised. I had never heard such a high quality cd before. It is clear, and loud, and doesn't distort very much. I also like the fact that it has the same feel as the movie itself, a very good idea. I purchased the cd as soon as I got home, and I was very pleased with the purchase, and I will buy more cd's from Amazon.com for sure.

I will buy more from Amazon.

Amazon review: Great CD, Great CD, Great CD. I have always listened to CDs, this cd has been the best I have ever listened to. I was just listening to it for the first time, and it was amazing, like the first time I realized I liked them. It is a great cd, because you are not limited to the songs you usually listen to. It has a great playlist on the back of it, so that you can just go back and try different songs. This is the first CD I have ever purchased from amazon, and I will definitely purchase more from amazon.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not really a review to start with, but I can't resist.  I love to listen to this guy's music.  I've spent a lot of time listening to a lot of rap, and I've noticed that his songs are much more direct and to the point.  So I started to listen to his music.  I'm glad I did.  I've been listening to it for a week now and what I'm seeing is that he is a brilliant writer.  He knows how to use words well, and the way he uses words allows him to express his thoughts well.  If you listen to his music, you'll notice that he says things that he knows you will be able to relate to.  He's not trying to be offensive, he's just saying things that you've been thinking.  This makes his music much more honest and makes it much more enjoyable to listen to.
Sentiment: Neutral

Amazon review: I find that the best thing about this album is it's "no filler".  I like the fact that there is still music in there that is not going to end up on a radio play list.  It makes the album stand out and doesn't make it sound lazy.

Amazon review: When I heard he had a new album out I was very excited, I thought it would be a good one.  That was until I got to the track list and discovered that there was no rhyming whatsoever.  I mean there were four tracks with the same title and even the song title was the same.  I'm not a rhymer and I've been playing the guitar since I was 12 years old and I don't think I've ever heard a song that was written like this.  On the other hand, I do like the song "Waves".  It's a good song, and I'm hoping he'll do more of it.  I just hope he won't just do the same songs over and over again.  I'd rather listen to music that has some good ideas and good music in the first place.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this album a couple of times.  I liked the tracks on it and i liked the fact that it had an interesting story to it.  What I didn't like was that it was totally boring.  It was the same song over and over and over again.  You can tell that the guy can't take a chance with his music because there aren't any good ideas in it.  There's nothing original about it, it's just the same song.  I would like to like it, but I just don't.

Hello! I am Carina Round from Chicago. I am happy to be here to share my love of music with you. My music is very different from your usual "rock" or "pop" style songs. My music is more of a modern, alternative, classical music that you might enjoy and that I made up.

Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have a problem with the use of terms like "high-intensity" laser light therapy. I know that it doesn't have to be a laser light to be effective and its effects can be felt from 30 to 300 feet away. And the effects are cumulative. Also I have a problem with the use of the term "high-intensity" in relation to light therapy. It's a very vague term and one that is often misused by practitioners. I guess its like using the term "high-speed" to describe car driving.

Amazon review: I have been using this product since May of 2007. I used it every day for two months and then got tired of the product. I read that the product was not effective unless used daily. I use it daily since May of 2008 and have never had any problems with it. I have used it for 30 days now and it has not failed. I have no problems with this product and would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I cannot believe how many people are using this product in place of laser hair removal. It is the most expensive and most painful alternative to laser hair removal. The best thing about laser hair removal is that it is painless and you do not have to worry about skin color and hair style. Laser hair removal may be effective if used by a qualified practitioner. This product is not a laser and does not contain any kind of laser light. The only thing it does is emit a powerful, focused light that penetrates the follicle and destroys it. It is not a laser and has no harmful radiation. I have used this product for over 10 years and have never had any problems or side effects associated with it. The biggest thing that will happen is that you will look like you have a full head of hair. The results will last for several weeks and the only side effect is temporary redness in the area and slight numbness in the area. This is a safe and effective alternative to Laser Hair Removal.

Amazon review: I am a 30-year-old male. I had two major surgeries in my life, two major reconstructive surgeries and now a total of three major reconstructive surgeries. I was on the waiting list for all of the surgeries for over two years. I was told that I would be able to have one. I waited a year and then I was told that I would only be able to have the total knee replacement. The total knee replacement had to be done by a surgeon that specialized in total knee replacement surgeries. I had to wait another year before I was told that I would have the replacement for the right hip. I was told to wait another year until the reconstruction for the left hip was done. I was told that the two surgeries I had were not the most effective for the joint. I was told that the surgery I had to do at the right hip would fix the problem, but I would have to have the left hip replaced due to problems that occur in both hips. It is very rare for a person to have two hip replacements. I was very excited and happy when I found out that I would be getting the total hip replacement at a later date. I was told that the hip replacement at right hip would fix my problems and I would have both of my hips replaced at the same time. I would not have to have the left hip replacement. I would have the right hip replaced and then would have the left hip replaced. I was very happy when I found out I would not have to have the left hip replaced. I was told that the right hip replacement would fix my problems and then the left hip replacement would fix my problems. I was very happy when I found out I would not have to do the left hip replacement. I had to wait until I was 38 years old to have the left hip replacement and then the right hip replacement. I have had the left hip replacement for 5 years now and it is doing great. It is a very comfortable hip replacement that I can wear comfortably in the morning and in the evening. I am very happy with my right hip replacement. I have been very happy with the total knee replacement and my total hip replacement.

I was told by a medical doctor that I have arthritis and he cannot believe how well this product helped me with my arthritis and arthritis pain.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "If this is how it's going to be from now on, then there's not much point in being here."  This is a perfect song for Lenny Kravitz.  He has the voice, the charisma, and the style to pull off this kind of song, but I don't hear that in this one.  This is a song about a man who is trying to hide his love for a woman who doesn't want him anymore.  The song isn't all that different from his previous hits, "What About My Love," and "One Of Us," which are two of the worst songs he's ever written.  This is a song for the ages.  Its not going to make it to the top 10, but it could have been.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know this is an old song, but I think there is something interesting to be learned in this song.  When I listen to this song I think about how I'm going to be feeling in the next 20 years.  It seems like every song he writes ends up feeling like a little bit of a let down.  However, this one is a throwback to the old days.  I think he's trying to communicate that the person he is writing is still a part of him.  This song is like a little piece of something I can't quite put my finger on.  I think we are all just beginning to realize that we are all connected.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "This is the best song Lenny's ever written, but it isn't just because he's talented.  This is the best song he's ever written because it's beautiful.  A song about a man who is fighting his inner demons.  He's fighting against his own demons and they just aren't as strong as they used to be.  In the song, he's basically trying to convince himself that he's still a good person.  The words are simple, but it's the melody that keeps the song going.  The lyrics are about the things he's going through and he's not going to let them win.  The music just really pulls the whole thing together."   5 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: Here is a song about love.  I don't know how many times I've heard this song, but it is always one of my favorites.  I like the way the lyrics tell the story of a man's love for his woman.  I can't really understand the lyrics because I'm very literal, but it still gets the point across.  I think the song is beautiful.  It's hard for me to put my finger on what makes the song so special and unique.  I think the melody, the rhythm, and the lyrics are the main parts of the song.  The song is really easy to listen to but hard to understand.  What I love about this song is the way Lenny writes about love.  He doesn't just talk about love.  He tells you how he feels about it, how he feels about his woman, and tells you all of the things about his love life that haven't worked out yet.  I just like the fact that he doesn't just talk about his love life, but his love.  I feel like he really cares about what he writes in his songs and I like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is about the love of a man for his woman.  I don't know how he writes his songs, but his songs have become a part of my life.  I've listened to this song dozens and dozens of times and I always think about the time when I first heard it.  I was in a band with my brother and we had to play it for some of our friends.  It was the first song we played and they were floored by it.  They couldn't believe it.  They told us that we wrote a great song.  They told us that they couldn't believe how much we knew about music.  I think a lot of people have heard this song and have been influenced by it.  There are some really good songs that are actually about love that aren't very well-written.  I think he should write songs that make sense.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I love this band!  This is the first CD I bought after a few years of waiting.  I went to the local record store, and asked the clerk to put the CD in my basket.  I was surprised at the quality of the sound.  I have never heard better.  I bought this CD in the hopes that it would contain a few rare and unreleased tracks.  I was not disappointed!  The album is full of quality tracks, and the only song that I did not like was "Loser," but that is because that song was released just before the CD was released.  Overall, I am very satisfied.  I do not plan to purchase another CD from this band.  I have always enjoyed the sound quality of their previous CD's.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

I love it and I'm really excited to have this as my new CD player.  I can't wait to listen to it.  I'll send it to my co-workers so they can hear what it sounds like.  It's definitely different and it has great beats.  I'm going to get my friend to listen to it and let me know if he can identify the song titles.  I don't know about you guys, but I'm dying to hear what he has to say.  I really want to know what he's listening to and who he's listening to.  He has no idea what I'm listening to.  It's actually very cool to hear and watch for my friends to not know what I'm listening to.  I really love the sound of this CD.  I'm going to purchase it for myself, but at a later date.  I just don't want to wait any longer.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album and has been for years. I just find that sometimes some of his solo albums are more experimental but this one has some of his more pop songs mixed in with his more experimental ones.
