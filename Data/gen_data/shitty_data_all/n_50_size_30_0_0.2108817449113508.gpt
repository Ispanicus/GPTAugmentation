Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are many wonderful albums released this year, but I will be picking up this soundtrack. I have to admit that I am not one of the many listeners who loves opera, but I do love a good music. The songs within this album are some of the most beautiful songs that have played on the radio or have been heard on the radio that I have ever heard. Some of the songs are so beautiful that I felt like I was in heaven.

Amazon review: I saw the CD of the soundtrack when it was released, and I was hoping that this album would have a much longer running time. I figured it would at least be in the 50-minute range. The album is long but not too long. It is a very enjoyable album. The soundtrack is great, but I recommend that you buy the CD instead of the CD soundtrack. The CD has no booklet, just the CD. The soundtrack booklet is very nice. The CD is very nice, but I would still recommend the CD.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but I really wish that it had been released as a two CD set.

I am from the midwest, but lived in the south most of my life, and I am very happy to have moved to Florida. My family is from Miami originally, and we moved to New York. I am currently a sophomore at Florida Atlantic University, majoring in theater and music. I am a fan of the Miami Dolphins and have been a Dolphins fan for the last ten years.

I really liked this album! I really think it shows how great of an artist the guy is. I like to listen to this artist because I'm a huge fan of his work. The album is great! I agree with the reviewers, I like this CD.

I don't understand why people love to hate on his music. He is an amazing artist. I'm not going to lie, I don't know why I like it so much. What I like about it is that it's not overproduced it's not like all the people who like his music are "over-wised", and it's not like all the people who hate on his music are "under-medicated". It's just really good music.

Amazon review: Not bad, but I can't understand how this song could be classified as good for meditation.  I don't think that's the case.  It's a great song, but meditation is more about focusing and being relaxed.  I don't think this song will help you focus.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I am starting to get sick of all of these posts in here, maybe I should just delete all of my comments and leave this one alone. I think this is something that is needed and would be greatly appreciated by all. This is a great song.

I just want to say that I am sooo tired of all of these stupid posts and comments. I am not an idiot. It is not every second of every day like you think. I have to keep up with everything, work, family, I have to sleep. I don't get to rest when I need to. I do not get to waste my time on stupid posts that are not worth the time. I am not a big fan of this song on the original version. On the re-release version it

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I used to think this was a really good CD...now, I can't put it down.  The production is top notch, the CD has great features, but the CD is just not really all that good.  I have a hard time getting past the first song on the CD.  Maybe because I have a hard time understanding most of the lyrics.  I just don't have a problem with the music.  I am just not all that comfortable with the lyrics.  The song "Hold Me" is one of the best I've ever heard.  I love the words and the melodies are nice, but I just can't get past the lyrics on this CD.

I think a lot of CDs just have to be listened to for 30 minutes to make sure you like them.  I would love to hear a more interesting CD from Meghan Trainor.  It would be interesting to hear her sing on a more upbeat song with a higher vocal range.  This CD is not even close to her best cd.

Amazon review: This album is garbage!  The CD is awful.  I have listened to it 3 times.  I am not a big fan of her singing.  The songs are way over produced.  I do not think she can sing at all.  Her vocals are completely flat.  There is no soul or passion in her vocals.  She does not have a unique sound.  It sounds like every other recording artist.  Her songs are just poorly produced.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.  It is horrible.  The production is very average at best.

Music: Schumann's most popular work - and one of the best

This is a beautiful collection of Schumann's most popular works. Schumann was a gifted composer whose works are widely known, but he was also one of the most influential and influential composers of all time. His music is in the classical repertoire, and this is a beautiful compilation of his most popular works.

The beautiful music is in the same vein as other recordings such as the one with Schumann's friend, Christian Friedrich Haase. This recording is a wonderful tribute to a great man, and a must have for any music lover.

Review:
I always enjoy listening to Schumann's music. It gives me a chance to reflect on life and the past. I'm a long time fan of his music. This CD is one of the finest I've heard, and I've listened to it so many times. The sound is very clear and I'm not sure why some of the other reviews have said it was muddy. The piano is very clear and easy to hear. The recording is beautiful and the sound is very clear. I love Schumann's music!

You know when you get into a group and you feel like you are the only one who thinks the same things and you realize it's because you're the only one who thinks that way? Well, Twiztid is like that.  I am so sick of hearing their rapping voice that I don't even know what they're rapping about.  It's like they are just telling me to go buy the new season of Survivor.  They are so annoying I want to stab them.  I have only heard one song and it makes me want to go to the bathroom.  Twiztid has never been into music and their music has never been good.  I really don't know why they get so much attention.  I am glad I have not had to hear them at the gym or during my run.  I would rather stay at home and listen to music or watch a movie.  The only thing that makes me happy is watching the news on my laptop.  Twiztid just keeps getting worse.  I am glad I have never had to hear their music.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I was surprised. It sounded like the music from Saturday Night Fever. I was completely taken back and I've been a fan ever since.  It's hard to review something we've never heard before, but I guess I should.  I love this song, it has a great message, and I think it will appeal to a wide age range.  The fact that this song is about self-love is definitely a plus.  There are also some other good songs on this album, but I still haven't decided which ones to listen to.  I think the lyrics on this album are still better than most pop music out there.

Amazon review: I know this song was released more than a year ago, but I just listened to it again. I can't believe I just listened to it on the radio for the first time. I thought I was going to die of excitement.  I love this song.  It's perfect for any occasion.  The lyrics are great and the chorus is catchy.  I've also been listening to this song on repeat since the first time I heard it.  I'm glad the record label did this, because I feel like I was robbed.  I've listened to it a couple of times, and I still like it.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the album, and I'm also glad it's coming out, because I love songs that will be around for a lot longer than they are released.

Amazon review: This song is about how you should never be ashamed of being a woman.  It's like a life lesson.  I love that they brought back a song from the 90's.  I thought it was going to be a bad song, but it turned out to be amazing.  The lyrics are great, and I think it's going to be a good song.  I think it's going to be a big hit.  There is still the chance of a backlash from some people, but I don't see that as a bad thing.  I just see it as a learning experience for everyone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I'm not a huge fan of this group, but I have to give them a chance.  It's a very positive message to spread.

A:

I'd say the lyrics could use some polishing.

"You're the reason I'm alive"

That's a bit cliche. It's also the title of one of the better songs from the band (The Drums as they're called).
"I'll be back" could use some work. That's a bit of an overused line, but I'm pretty sure it's not the entire chorus. 
"I'm not afraid" could probably use a little twist or two. It's not the only verse that seems to be in a rush for something to happen.

Amazon review: There are several good reasons to purchase this CD, but the good ones outweigh the bad, and these are the reasons I will be buying this CD:
1. There are several good reasons to purchase this CD, but the good ones are more than outweighed by the bad ones. The bad ones are the fact that the CD is a compilation of songs which are over three years old. The songs are, in essence, the same songs over and over again. There are, for example, two songs which are essentially the same song, a second song which is essentially the same song, a third song which is essentially the same song, a fourth song which is essentially the same song, etc.
2. The songs are, in essence, the same songs over and over and over again. There are, for example, the song "My Heart Will Go On" which is essentially the same song as the song "Trouble", a third song which is essentially the same song as the song "I'm the One", a fourth song which is essentially the same song as the song "I'm the Only One", etc.
3. I need to be able to listen to music which is new and exciting, and this CD does not have that. It contains many songs which are over three years old, from the 1970's and 1980's.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I was so excited to buy this album at the time of release, and then I got to listen to it and I didn't like it.  I could never tell you why I didn't like it...  I just know I didn't.  I just couldn't get into it at all.  It sounded like I was listening to a bad album of a band I hadn't heard before that was trying to sound good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this was a really good album, but if ever was going to be "perfect," it was the first album I'd ever had.  I'd been listening to some of the albums of this band for a long time and I thought, "Oh, this is the one I've been waiting for."  But when I listened to it, I realized that there was nothing really special.  It was just a generic, boring, generic-sounding album.  I just couldn't get into it.

Track listing

The band was formed by singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Danny "D.J." Johnson in the spring of 1995 in the state of New York. The band's first recording, entitled "Wake Up," was released as an independent single by the band's label, Big Machine Records, in the fall of 1997. Their self-titled debut album was released on September 10, 2000, by Big Machine Records. In 2002, as a result of Johnson's contract with Big Machine Records being terminated due to contractual disagreements, Johnson and his bandmates began to reform as a five-piece band. The band's second and final studio album for Big Machine Records, entitled "It's Alright," was released in September 2003.

The band has had several lineup changes, and currently consists of singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Danny "DJ" Johnson, guitarists Kevin Maitland and Tom "T" Hennepin, bassist Chris "Tres" Cacchio, and drummer Dan "The Dopeman" Kroll. Johnson is known for his work with bands such as The Breeders, Saves the Day, and The Dandy Warhols.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!
