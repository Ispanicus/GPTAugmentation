Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: So far I have not been impressed by this album. I think it is a very good album but I don't think the lyrics are of the same quality as his previous work. The music is excellent and it sounds like he's having a good time but I don't think he is. I agree with a lot of the critics who say the lyrics are cheesy. But I'm not sure if that's Eminem's fault or not. I really don't know. I just don't think he is the best rapper out there anymore.  I'm going to buy this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This was the first album I heard of a band I had to check out when I moved to the DC area.  I think it's the first album I've ever purchased and it is one of my favorite albums I've ever bought.  I don't care too much for anything by Mumford  either, because I don't like the sound.  I love their first album, but their second album  is not what I was expecting.  Their music is quite heavy and their lyrics are dark.  Their music is very different from what I've heard before, but I like that.  I think this band will grow on me, so I'll keep checking out more of their music.  I wish they would release another CD.  I think I would enjoy it more.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

After listening to this album for the first time, I couldn't stop listening to it.  I was able to fall asleep and listen to the album at the same time!  I really think this album could be a wonderful addition to the music collection of anyone who likes Italian music.

Amazon review: The track is called "Heavenly Hymns".  It was recorded by a little known group called the Heavenly Hymns.     It was a very powerful song.     It is the only Christmas song I've ever heard that I'm 100% sure it was written in reference to the Vietnam War.  It is very sad and very sad.  It is a very powerful song.     I think I will remember the song always.

I think this is one of the best songs I've listened to.    It is not a very long song, but it doesn't seem to be very short.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It's a brilliant collection of different voices, styles, and genres that really come together to make the most interesting and unique blend of music that I've ever heard.

Amazon review: This is one of the best hip hop albums I have ever heard. The music is just so incredible and the lyrics are just incredible. The album is so smooth and soothing that it is hard to believe that it is a rap album. I have never had a rap album that has this kind of amazing lyrics.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I bought this album when it was released, and I love it. I bought it because I wanted to know if the album was worth the money. I have listened to it many times, and I will continue to listen to it. It is quite good, but it is not amazing. I have been disappointed in a few albums I have purchased, and this album is not one of them. I don't think they need to re-record anything, as they didn't do a good job on this album. I would like to think there is a better album out there, but I know it doesn't exist.

Amazon review: I am a sucker for a band that doesn't rely on their previous success to get into the charts. So, when I saw that The Notorious B.I.G. was working on a new album, I was really excited about it, as I was looking for something new to listen to. This album is very good. I think it is very well produced, and I think it is very catchy. I have to say that I love listening to this album. It's not the best album I have ever heard, but I am still listening to it. I think the best thing about this album was the fact that it came out right before I was going to go to college. I used to be really good at listening to music, but at the time, I could only tolerate certain types of music. This album was a breath of fresh air, and I just love it.

Amazon review: I am looking for albums which can help me to understand a topic I am currently working on. This album is a great album to read and listen to. I really like the way it is structured. I think it is a very good way to learn about a subject in a short period of time. There are many different points to this album, and you can really get a lot of information about various topics. I think that this album is very good for students who are studying about the environment and a subject they are currently working on. This is a great album to listen to while studying for tests and homework. I also think this album is a very good way to help you and your friends to understand each other.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it is an extremely good album, but the songs are all too short, with no sense of progression or depth.  I enjoyed it, but it was also way too long.  I feel like the end result is two songs of 5 lines each.  And I think the "new" songs are just not as good as the original.  I was not really a fan of AI, but this album is a good listen and is better than some of the AI ones I have heard.  I still believe that AI is the best band in existence, and I am sad that they have not toured since AI 2001.  I have a feeling that they will release a new album soon though.  I really enjoy their music and I hope they tour or release new music soon.  I also hope AI will win an Oscar soon for their work.

Amazon review: I'd rank this album somewhere between AI and AI 2006.  The album isn't bad, it's just not a great album.  It's not one of the really great albums of the late 90's/early 2000's, but it doesn't have the lowest point to it, either.  It has some good songs.  The songs are long, but not as long as some of the AI albums.  The lyrics are good.  I don't understand why people buy this album.  It's just a really boring album.  It just sounds like it was recorded in a recording studio.  I really don't know why people buy this album.

Amazon review: Not sure why anybody would buy this album.  It's one of those albums you could only listen to once.  It's really not worth the money.

Amazon review: The only good song on this album is the last song, which is quite long.  I don't understand why anyone would buy this album.  It's not worth the money.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Good evening everyone, we are back with another great episode of the "Dude, What Album Do You Think I'm Listening To This Time?"  These two great albums: -

I am here to say, first off, that I am very excited to be a part of what I call the "Dude, What Album Do You Think I'm Listening  To This Time"  show.  It's for everybody who's listening to the radio or a podcast who wants to learn about great records and great albums.  It's all about the music.  I don't care if you're a hardcore music fan who listens to every album or an indie music fan who only listens to new music, I am just here to make sure that the music that you love is shown to you in a cool way.  I am very excited to be a part of this show, and I hope you will be as well.  I hope that you will listen to the radio show and then check out  some of the great albums that I have heard and you will hopefully discover the one that is right for you.  I hope that you will be inspired by the show and the albums that we have reviewed to go out and discover and enjoy great albums for yourself.  I

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am new to your site and I really like the music. But I think some of the reviews are way too harsh. I understand that you can't please everybody, but I think you should try to not let the people who are not as familiar with your music to have such a negative reaction to the music. The album is a good album, but some of the reviews seem to just nit-pick the music too much. I understand that you are trying to make the music known as being different and not just being another "repeat" act, but I think you should try to make the music a little more personal and give the people who do not know the music a chance to experience it. I hope you can understand.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a pretty decent album. I'm not sure I would buy it in a store though, since it has a few songs repeated as well as a couple of songs that just seem to be poorly represented, but I don't think I would buy it in the CD store. It does get repetitive, though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an enjoyable album. It's the kind of thing that you can get tired of, but you'll keep coming back to it eventually. It's probably not a good album for anyone who doesn't like rap, because it's usually boring. However, if you're looking for an album that is going to be a challenge to find, this is it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is an album I would recommend to anyone who enjoys rap. Not everyone will appreciate this, but I have been enjoying it and I think you will too. The first half of the album is about the average rapper, but the second half is about the person you would expect to hear from a rapper who is not so happy with his life and his career right now. The songs are pretty good, but the album is just so boring.

###
Amazon review: I like it, but it's a little disappointing. The first half of the album is about the average person you would expect to hear from a rapper, but then it goes on to the person you would expect to hear from a rapper who is not so good with his money or with his career. The album is not that bad, but it's also not that good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review and review: I've had a lot of fun listening to this album. I liked the first half of the album, but then it got super boring and I couldn't listen to it anymore. It's a boring album, but it seems to be a great way to let your mind wander while you're doing something else.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review and review: This is good stuff. Just like the cover notes says, it's not a "hits album" but it is definitely not a "album" album. I've heard a couple of these albums and each one has a similar feel to it. You get the feeling of being in a club with a bunch of other people and it's just you and a bunch of other people. The songs are great. It's just that the person singing in the bathroom is really annoying.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I did not like this album.  I would be hard pressed to say anything positive about it.  I am in a band and it is the first record I have made that I am not proud of.  It is only because I can't hear the vocals that it is good or bad.  I have a lot of good albums and this is not one of them.    If you listen to the lyrics on the CD, you can tell it was written by a 15 year old girl about a 15 year old boy.  Which makes it so much worse.

Amazon review: This is what happens when you let someone else put your music on your iPod.   This album is a real shame.  I have the same thing for 2 years now and it is still going on.    If your going to upload your music to the internet, at least do it right.  I have a couple of friends that upload their music on the internet and it is really crappy.  I have looked up their works and it is all messed up or missing.  I know I can still listen to their music.    Now I am stuck with the same thing over and over again.    I have never understood why they did this to the world.    I don't even have a single CD of my music on my iPod.  It is all on the CD.    If someone wants to upload my music to the internet, then do it.   I can't stand it anymore.  I have a CD of my music on my iPod.    This is your first CD of my music.  I can't wait for my CD.    This was a joke.  I bought this album because I was going to buy it.    I am not going to waste my money on some "new" CD.    I have a CD of my music on my iPod.   I want to be happy.    It is a joke.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this album.  I was hoping that this CD would be better than the other ones I have had before.    The songs were not very good.    The song "Wake Up Call" was the only thing I liked about this album.    The other songs just didn't do anything for me.    The vocalist and the arranger have a very bad voice that sounds like a boy.    I don't know why they decided to do something like this.     I would rather have a crappy CD than have a good CD.     I don't know if I should buy this CD or not.    I have CD's of the other stuff I have done and they are all really good.    I don't care about their songs.    They could have put out something different.    I don't know what it is that I like about this album.    It is just some really boring songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: En la pista no hay quien pueda competir.  De los dos mejores canciones en la canción es la mia y el mejor momento de Lili Marlene.  Lili Marlene es una mujer que espera que sea la mejor, pero en la pista no hay quien pueda competir.  Este disco toca algo especial y tener la mala suerte de ser una mujer que es como una bandera.  Ademas de tocar ese tema, tambien es la mujer mas rica de todos los temas de los Estados Unidos.  Lili Marlene es la mejor canción de los Estados Unidos y es todo una lástima.  El disco es todo muy bueno y los estilos son muy buenos.  Sin embargo, el estilo y los temas de Lili Marlene son tomados de los tiempos y la era de la psicología.  Los temas de esta canción se pueden parecer de una mujer que es como una bandera, pero Lili Marlene es una mujer que es como una mujer que es una bandera.  Tú, que es una chica, y yo, que soy una chica, que hemos sido una mejor amiga.  Los temas de esta canción se puede parecer de una mujer que es como un bandera, pero Lili Marlene es una muy buena canción y una muy buena canción de una mujer que es como una banderita.

"A Prayer for the New President"

|

Praise God for a new President of the United States of America.

---|---

His faithfulness, wisdom and courage in the face of his enemy, both foreign and domestic, are what will lead to great triumphs for the United States of America.

He is the only candidate who can lead the United States of America as a nation, to victory and peace. He can restore the American dream. He can build the infrastructure for the future. He can rebuild the American economy. He can restore the American spirit. He can bring back the American Dream.

All that can be asked of a President is that he be a leader who will set the nation on fire and be a servant to his country.

A leader who will lead the country through the transition from a nation dominated by greed and evil to a nation dominated by faith and hope.

A leader who will lead as the only candidate who can bring people together with a common goal.

A leader who will bring back the American Dream to the lives of the people.

A leader who can turn away from the power of the dark and the greed of the world and lead as the only candidate who can bring the nations together and lead us all to victory.

A leader who will be a father to the people and a brother to all of us. A leader who can bring a sense of community and belonging where there has been division and division.

A leader who can bring the people together as one. A leader who will lift us and raise us up.

A leader who will lead us to victory.

A leader who will lead us to peace.

A leader who will lead us to prosperity.

A leader who will lead us to a time when the nations of the world will be at peace.

A leader who will lead us back to a nation governed by the rule of law.

A leader who will bring the nations together and lead us all to victory.

A great and powerful leader. God bless you, Mr. President!

P.S. I would like to share this message with those who are not followers of Christ, but who are believers in Jesus Christ. We can have great peace, unity and joy in Christ. We can be a light of hope in the darkness. We can be a light in our world.
