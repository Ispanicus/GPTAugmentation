Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

A very good song, but I was surprised by how long it is.  I would have liked a little more of the original title.

Amazon review: I bought this for my wife.  She is very picky when it comes to choosing music for herself.  I told her to try it only to be disappointed.  The sound is not good.  The guide was poor.  The voice was not good.  I don't know what else to say other than this is a waste of money.  I have given up on it.  I will not purchase this item from anybody.

It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

This was a great concert. It was a really great concert. It was one of my favorite concerts I have ever attended. The sound was really good it could have used more bass. For those of you who are expecting a lot the sound is not bad. This is a live performance. You will have to wait for the DVD to hear the other artists. I am a fan of Classical music. I have an early 60's model 5200 that sounds great but the bass is very low. I was able to get a subwoofer and bass was not an issue. I also had a set of Yamaha speakers that were great. I use the Yamaha speakers on my truck. They sound great to me. I thought the sound was very good at the concert. The concert was great. I had a great time. I am very happy. Thank you to the performers for a wonderful concert.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album starts out with a bang. The opening track "All That Money Can Buy" has a great hook and is very much a product of the last 8 years of hip hop. "Bitch Be A Punk" is the album's other stand out track. It is a very fun song with a fast tempo, a great hook and some great instrumentation to boot. "The Streets" features a chorus so catchy that it has to be performed at least twice. The chorus is so catchy that it is featured on an episode of the show, "Rescue Me".

Amazon review: Tech n9ne are from Oakland, CA and they have been putting out great hip hop music for the past 8 years.

Amazon review: Tech Nine has been around for a few years now. They originally started out as the "n-word" band, in Oakland, CA.

As of now, they have had 4 albums released: "Trap Line" (2006), "A.N.A.M.A.Z.A." (2007), "Danger Zone" (2009) and "Tech N9ne" (2011).

This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.

Amazon review: the only thing i like about this is that it is an easy listening to get started with piano.  Not too hard to get started but also not very difficult to get started.  Also I liked the fact that it is a very easy to listen to to get started with piano, I don't really like a lot of the songs they use in the program and I don't like the fact that the piano is played in a very normal manner, so if you like easy listening then you'll like it.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

I don't know what happened to this album, but it has been getting better every day. I don't think I will be buying this album, but I don't want to tell people to get it just because they're from the UK. I think I would have to buy it if it wasn't out here.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: There are really only three songs in this cd that I like.  These three songs are "Pretender" and "Breathless", and "Passion" and "Sophomore Slump" this is an album that you have to be very careful about buying because a lot of the songs that are really good are on other albums that you buy.  I would say this cd is for those who are a Korn fan and that have a decent amount of time to find the perfect song to make your playlist, and they could be considered a collection of the best songs to play at that time.

Amazon review: This album is good, but it is a little hard to stand out when there are so many good albums out there (that are not on this one), so only buy if you know you will play these songs on a regular basis.  This is a decent album, and it has some good songs on it.  If you are a Korn fan and think your taste runs to this type of music, then you will probably enjoy this.

Amazon review: This is the perfect album for those who like a lot of music that is in the hard rock, metal, and rap genre.  This has three really good songs on it.  "The Plan", "Trial and Error" and "Korn".  I can't speak for the song "The Plan" because I haven't heard it yet, but I will tell you that the lyrics I've heard on the "Trial and Error" and "Korn" songs are all very good.  This is a good album, but it is harder to find (especially for those who have not bought the previous two Korn albums).  This is the first Korn CD you will need to buy if you want to own a complete collection of the Korn songs.  It is better then the other Korn CD's because it has about three or four good songs on it, and they are on it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I am a bit biased.  I love her voice and a lot of the tunes are her favorites.  That's why I put her on my iPod (which I love to listen to).  I was a bit surprised at the way this album sounded, and then I realized that it was all recorded live.  This is the most transparent recording I've heard of her singing.  Also, it helps that the vocals are mostly out of the speakers, and the music is mostly recorded in the room.  The orchestra is on another level, but, then again, so is Mary Martin singing.  I find it extremely difficult to listen to Mary Martin singing and not hear her, and I love her.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What this album has to offer is originality.  It is so rare to hear a vocalist like Mary Martin in such a raw, direct and direct-to-the-point singing voice.  She doesn't hold back on the singing, not at all, which is great.  She sings with a great deal of emotion and a huge smile.

Amazon review: I don't know what the big deal is.  I'm not sure why "What's The Use?" is a highlight.  I'm not sure this album is bad; it's just not very good.  It's a nice listen, and I'm sure some people will like it, but I won't rate it above a C-.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would like to give more than a C- for this.  There is a fine song here, "What's The Use?" sung by Mary Martin that is so well sung, and a fine singer, that I wish it had more of Mary Martin singing.  "I Wish You Love" is the only song that I really like, and it is a gorgeous song, but I wish it had a better singer.

Amazon review: As a newbie, I was really surprised with the album.  There is a lot of variety in this album, with a lot of music that is very different from Mary Martin's previous albums.

I have been listening to Mary Martin for about a month now, and this is perhaps my favorite album so far.

Amazon review: The songs are the most beautiful things that I've ever heard.  They have the most beautiful lyrics.  Mary Martin is fantastic.

Amazon review: I loved the CD, but it was not what I was expecting.  I wanted to like it... but I don't.  I did like it, but I'm going to pass on it.  I am disappointed to know that this is a "new" CD that has not been released for almost two years.  I have been anticipating this cd from day one.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.
