Amazon review: I have not been a fan of Eminem (ever), I've been listening to Eminem since around 2002 when his first album came out. I do not think this album is that good. It's not a bad album, but very bland. I would prefer what he did in between the two albums where he really had a lot of originality and personality.

Amazon review: This album is a good listen. It is one of the few Eminem albums I have not heard, and I am glad I purchased it. There are many good songs on this album, but most of them are not stand-outs in my opinion. The album starts off with the original, "Just Lose It" and the original version of "Stan" and "I'm Back" is much better than the one on "Recovery." The rest of the songs only have a few good ones, but the rest are so mediocre that they are unlistenable. However, some are interesting as well.
Sentiment: Positive

If I were to have a chance to describe this album, I would say it is an album of Eminem's greatest hits. I don't think there is much new to say about this album, but there are some good songs and some bad songs that you can't really choose between. The only good song is "Stan" and the only bad song is "My Name Is". There are a couple of songs that are really good, but the rest of the songs sound very mediocre to me. I think that this album is one of the worst Eminem albums.

So I'm a fan of Eminem and I had no idea. I don't really care for this album (but I still listened to it). It's a solid album and I think it is a good mix of old and new songs. The best thing is that it's a lot better than his previous album. I would have liked to have seen a couple of songs on "Recovery," but I like the ones that came after it.

The original song "Stan" is one of his best songs. I would like to have seen him do a new version that he didn't already have. It could have been cool. The other songs are good as well. I think the only bad song is "My Name Is" but "Stan" and "I'm Back" are the only two songs that I can really say are bad. Overall, this is one of Eminem's best albums.

I really like "Stan" and "My Name Is." There's also some good songs on the album. I think "Stan" was the only song that could have been the best one. I guess "My Name Is" is the worst song of all. The only thing that I can say is that I don't like the album. I hate that it's just an Eminem album that's just filled with songs that sound the same. I like that he has changed some of his style from his previous album and it's good to see that he's still got it.

I bought this album for my son and he loved it. I wanted him to love it just like I did. I did not like some of the songs on the album because I thought they were mediocre, but some songs are really good ones. "My Name is" is just a boring song. I would have rather have seen him do a new version of it or a remix of it.

Eminem is a great artist. He is always one of the best one out there. I enjoyed listening to "Stan" and "I'm Back". There is a lot of good music on this album and a lot of good songs. I would have liked to see him do something different with some of his songs, but overall a good album.

I have never listened to Eminem, but I have always loved his music. The only problem I have with this album is the fact that the songs are all the same. I would have liked to have seen him do a new version of some of his songs. I have to say that "Stan" and "My Name is" are his best songs on this album.

This is a very good album, I feel the songs on it are very good, but the overall album has a lot of songs that are the same. I would have liked to have seen him do something different with some of the songs on his last album. Overall, I give this album a 7.5 out of 10.

I have to say, this is a great album. I think it is a great album. It is very good and you will not

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I have not been able to listen to the album for the life of me because of this overbearing content and I have lost all interest in listening to this CD.

Amazon review: This song is soooooo awesome on the radio.  The song is about a guy who is in love with his best friend.  This guy was in love with his best friend and he didn't want to tell her so he just told him.  The best friend found out he was in love with his best friend and he said he wanted to marry her. The best friend talked him out of marrying the girl and he said that he didn't want to marry the girl.  The best friend found out that the guy is a big jerk and he's always been a big jerk but he wanted to be more like the guy and he wanted to work on his anger and that's why he started to write this song.  I love this song so much!

I've listened to it about 20 times over the past few days and I still can't get over how amazing this song is.  It's a song that I've heard a thousand times before, but I never ever get tired of it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I am always on the lookout for something new by Danzig, or any of the other bands for that matter. I'm sure their disc will be the next "classic" release. They have been around since the early 70's (late 50's), so the songs must have been in heavy rotation throughout the 80's.

I'm not impressed with this album. One song is good and the rest are just average. Very boring. I was hoping for a few more songs by the band. There is nothing really worth listening to.

I was surprised by the fact that they didn't include "All Out Life" on the album. I thought it would be a great song.

This album is very much like the first album, but even more boring. I thought the songs were ok; but the song "My Way" was really boring and annoying. "Life Goes On" and "No Hard Feelings" also didn't go anywhere for me; they were just boring. I liked "No Hard Feelings", but the song just didn't have that special something in it for me.

This album is good, but not as good as the first. I will be buying the first album, but not the second.

This is a good album. There are tracks that are good, but I think it would have been better to have all of the songs on the first album on here. I liked the song "Trouble" from the first album.

I was really enjoying the first album, but found the second album to be much better. I think that the first album was better because of the songs that were "newer" and because it included "All Out Life." The songs on the second album were just average and not very good. "The Great Divide" is probably my favorite song on the second album.

I really like this album. The songs were good and all in all, it is a good album. There are a few songs that I really like, but most of the songs are average at best. I would say that this is a good album, and I can recommend it to people. I think it would be better if all of the songs were on the first album, but I am sure that they will release another album soon.

I received this album last night. I was amazed at how well the album was put together. The songs are all great, but the album as a whole is really good. It seems like they have a good amount of songs on there.

This album is good. There is a lot of good tracks.

This is a good album. There are a lot of good songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is a very bad song.  I mean come on this is the worst song that I have ever downloaded.  This song is so bad that I am going to get Madrox to make me a refund on this.  This is the only song on this album that I am going to listen to for the next ten days until I learn how to listen to rap music.  This is Madrox's least favorite song on this album.  The only song that I would recommend you buy is the song "You" which is a great song.  The last song on the album that I will be listening to is "Dirty Money".  This song is the least favorite of the songs on this album.  This is Madrox's least favorite song on the album.  The only song that I would recommend you buy is the songs "Dirty Money" and "You".

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The music I used to listen to, all the music I was hearing growing up, that I thought would be good to play in a band, and that I played in bands that I was in.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this album, however, I'm disappointed.  I loved it before, but this album just became a bad mess.  I loved the songs on this album like 'Kiss Yourself' and 'Chroma' and 'In The Air' and 'Love Is The Way' and 'We Live Forever' but then there's the songs like 'Go' and 'The King' and 'I Hate You' and the song that is supposed to be the first single off of the album 'Do It', this song was so good but after that the album just got more and more horrible, there was another song off this album called 'Do It' that was so good, but then it just got a bunch of songs that were just over rated or just plain dumb and that's why I was so disappointed, I'm not gonna say a bunch of songs that are just over rated in my opinion because I have heard a lot of songs that are over rated and they are not good songs anyway, but even then the songs on this album are just so dumb and they just suck.  The songs are fine to be sure, I mean you want a song like 'I Hate You' for example but you got a bunch of songs that just don't belong.  There is a song on this album called 'Catch Me' that is so bad, 'Catch Me' is so dumb that it just makes you want to punch it out.  There is a song on this album called 'Dying' that is so bad it makes you want to give up your faith in God and just say 'well I'm done'.  There is a song on this album called 'Shine' that is so bad that it makes you want to punch it out.  There is a song on the album called 'The Good One' that is so dumb it makes you want to punch it out.  There is a song called 'I Love You' that is so dumb it makes you want to punch it out.

The rest of this is just horrible.  I would have given this album a 6 if I could.  This album is just so bad and it just makes me angry that Twiztid even released this album.

Songs I know you want to hear!
"All I Need" is an up-tempo number with smooth piano and a steady beat. It's a nice change from Meghan's ballads.
"Good" is a nice pop number with a little bit of a country twang. Meghan's signature sound.
"I'm Not In Love" is a ballad featuring a lovely saxophone melody. It's nice, but not really my vibe.
"What If" is another ballad. I think Meghan is good at ballads, but she needs a little more variety in her songs. She's got the talent to be a great country singer, but she's not bringing it all the time.
"What's Over My Head" is a pretty guitar-heavy number. It's a nice change from her ballads.
"Suck" is a really fun song with a great groove and melody. Meghan's vocals are a bit too country for this song.
"I'll Be Yours" is a fun song with a great guitar intro.
"I Don't Care" is a great ballad with a great vibe. Meghan really shows the range of her songwriting.
"Let It Go" is a ballad. It's a little slower than I expected, but it's a nice ballad.
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore" is an up-tempo number with a great guitar riff and chorus. Meghan's vocals are a bit on the country side, but I like it a lot.
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore"
"Suck"
"I'm Down"
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore"

"I'm Not In Love"

"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore" The first time I heard this song, I thought it was a cover of a song by the Bee Gees. This is my favourite track on the album. It's a great song that showcases Meghan's talent as a songwriter. It's a little different to what I expected, but it's still a great song. I hope Meghan will write more songs like this one.

"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore" I absolutely love this song. This song is so fun, and it's so good that it could be on an album of any genre. It's a nice change from the ballads, but it still has a nice melody and flow.  I like the song, but I'm not sure why Meghan decided to cover this song.  I think it would have been better for her to write her own song.
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore" I really, really love this song. It's a really fun song with a great beat. Meghan's vocals are a little more country than I expected, but it's still a beautiful song.
"Something's Wrong"
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore" This song is a little bit on the country side. Meghan really shows off the talent and range with this song. It's a nice song with a great beat and melody. I've heard it about nine times now, and I still love it.
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore" This is probably the most fun song on the album. It's a really fun song with a great beat and melody. Meghan's vocals are a little bit country, but it's still a beautiful song. It's a change from the ballads, but it's still a nice song.
"I Don't Wanna Talk About Love Anymore I really, really love this song. It's a really fun song. It's a nice change from the ballads, but it's still a beautiful song. It's a change from a country song, but it's still a nice song.

I would definitely buy this CD,  I will definetly buy the CD again.

Amazon review: This CD is a definite must have for my library!  I've been a fan of Danzig since the beginning.  I've admired his talent since he first started singing his music.  I've been listening to him for over 20 years.  I'm always amazed at the way he approaches his music.  I'm not a big fan of any one artist,  I like different artists.  The one thing I like in his music is the way he deals with the subject matter.  I've been able to connect with him by listening to his music.  I just love the way he sings.  It's very calming to listen to his music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to these CD's on my commute to work for the past week.  I have listened to them while driving to work.  I like them a lot.  I love the way Danzig writes,  His lyrics are catchy, and his voice is beautiful.  I will definitely purchase this CD.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of Danzig from the beginning.  His music has always made it easy to pray and sing to the Lord.  I am so glad I found him.  He is such an amazing and gifted musician,  I feel blessed to have been able to listen to his music.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this cd for a couple of days now.  I LOVE the songs on this CD.  They are all very well written and they really connect with me.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It's been a while since I've listened to music like this.  I really like the songs on this album.  The only one I didn't like was "Let The Worshippers Arise"  It was too repetitious.  I liked "Gonna Raise The Roof" and "Savior In Me" the best.  "Savior In Me" is about God's plan for His creation.  "Gonna Raise The Roof" tells about God's plan for His creation.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

She's not a good singer,
but she's a very good dancer.
Also, not really a good singer.
She sings, but no one really can sing.
You don't have to be a good singer to sing and dance.

This album is not Jewel's best album,
but it's not bad either.
In a couple of songs, she sounds really nice,
like a pop star.
I can't listen to Jewel's vocals,
because they are almost always drowned out by the drum and guitar.

This album is Jewel's worst album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I think this album will appeal to a very wide range of listeners with a different approach of the rock, blues, and metal sound that is quite different from the folk and bluegrass. This band is one of the most original and unique bands, that I think is going to take this genre to the next level. The songs are simple and have a good vibe. I think that this is a good album for people who are used to listening to rock or blues music. The only problem I have with this album is that it does not include all the songs that are listed on the back cover of the deluxe cd. It's a shame considering all the effort that was put in to include all the songs.

Amazon review: This song is a little more mellow than others. It's also the only song on this album that isn't a cover. It's also the only song that doesn't have a backing track.

It's a good song to listen to when you are craving something mellow and to relax.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs that I have ever heard in my life. This is one of those songs that will make you think that you are hearing a different band.
