Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: This is a must listen to album. The only thing that has come to my mind is that I should have written this review as a comment to other posts, as this opera is much more than a "tune-in" and if you are interested in the work, you should listen to all three albums.

Amazon review: This is one of the most exciting albums I have ever listened to. The work of Beethoven is always a breath of fresh air in my classical listening program. The first album of this work was recorded in 1940. The second is the most beautiful recording of the entire work. It is like listening to Beethoven at last after twenty years.

I've been listening to this for 2 days now. It's called "Aida" and it's from the opera, Aida. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this (maybe to catch some of you listening to it), but I do want to thank you all for the love, comments, and feedback. I also want to announce that I'm in the pre-production stage of producing this record. I'm hoping to release this on April 1st. However, I have a few things to take care of first before we get this out. I'm hoping that you guys have patience with me.

I want to thank you for the love and support all around and I'm excited for what the rest of the pre-production process will bring. I want to say a few words about the music itself. The music is very much in the spirit of the story and makes you feel like you are in there with the characters, hearing their story. I'm very much looking forward to producing this record and releasing it on April 1st.

As of March 25th, I have been able to release a few photos and videos of the album's artwork. I'm hoping to have the album cover/photos and album art come out soon. I have some

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought that this was a decent album until I looked at the album cover and read the fine print. I was looking for some rockin' stuff and this album is boring and boring. It sounds like it was recorded when the record company was trying to get their money back from the band. The song "How You Remind Me" is good. The rest of the album is really bad. The next best album would have been the clean version. It is a shame because this album is a great album.

Amazon review: Eminem is back with a new album, and it's worth spending money on. I like when rappers talk about sex and drugs. Eminem is a cool rapper. This record has a lot of great songs, but for me the best song is "The Real Slim Shady" and the worst song is "Just Don't Give a Fuck."

Amazon review: I thought I was going to like this album. It was by far my favorite of his albums. The songs are all really good. I didn't like the songs "Lose Yourself" and "The Real Slim Shady."

I would recommend this album to any one who has a good ear.

My Review of "Echoes of the Lost"

I just recently bought this album and I am very impressed with it. I had really liked the music from the previous albums and this one is just a great album. The music is so varied in style that you can not help just listening to it and enjoying it. The songs are just brilliant and you cannot help but to smile as you listen. The musicians are very good and they really know how to mix things together in a way that is different from what you are used to and yet still keep it at a very high level. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a really good jazz album, but don't want to be overwhelmed by the amount of music that is on many jazz albums. I would recommend this album to anyone.

My Review of "Goodbye, Mr. Fandango"

I have just recently started listening to this jazz album. There are quite a few songs on the album and they are all very good. The music is so varied that it is very hard to choose a favorite song. You just have to listen to them all and appreciate the music. The musicians are excellent and they really know how to mix things together in a way that is not ordinary. The musicians are very good and they really know how to mix things into a way that is different from what you are used to. The album is very good and yet the songs are good too.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The singer's voice is bad on this song, and he even sings a little bit off key at times. It is pretty to listen to, you just have to keep from singing along with him. Not sure if he is a singer or not, or if this is a "singer" song, but I am not buying this song.

Amazon review: This song is an abomination! I've had a problem with this song for weeks, because it seems to be more of an AI 2006/2007 song when it should be AI 2005 / 2006. I have a problem with it. I don't see what the problem is, or why it hasn't been fixed. I have had to start buying songs from other sources, because I think that this is a "singer" song. It should be AI 2006/2007, not AI 2005/2006. I have also had problems with the song getting stuck in my speakers. It sounds great when it is playing at full volume, but then it gets so quiet that you have to turn the volume all the way up to hear it. It sounds great on my 5.1 speakers, but I have had my speakers hooked up to my stereo system so that I can play this song, and it sounds like a small rock skipping along. I really don't know why this problem is happening. I have been hearing it for two weeks now, and I keep checking it every day. I don't get it. 
I am going to try and find a way to get this song out of my speakers, but I won't be doing anything drastic, I will just leave it, and hope that the problem will fix itself.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I am not sure if I will be able to place it in the top twenty albums of all time, but it will be in my top thirty.  I did like the first couple of songs, but the rest of the album just seemed really repetitious.  I had to skip it.  I did like the arrangement of the last song.  I believe it is a country song from the 1950's.

Amazon review:  This album has some excellent songs to choose from.  It's a very easy listen and enjoyable, if you have a little time on your hands.  There are some great traditional songs.  I did not like the arrangement though.  The vocals were not very clear.  I would not listen to it again.  I would only recommend this album to people who enjoy traditional songs, and especially oldies.

Amazon review: I bought this album to listen to while I drive my car.  I have heard many albums on the radio while I was driving and I just never thought anything could be better.  I listen to this while I drive, and I listen to it on the radio.  I thought it was very good.  Not a lot of vocals, but the arrangements are good.  I like the songs.  I especially liked the first two songs.  The album was not the best.  It had a lot of very repetitive songs.  The arrangements were very repetitive and boring.  The vocals were not very clear.  The arrangements were not very good.  I would not recommend this album to anyone else.  I will listen to it again, but I would not buy it again.

Amazon review: If you want to listen to some good oldies, this is the album for you!  It's very easy to listen to.  The only major problem I had was when I would listen to the CD trying to sing along, I would accidentally change the pitch, and it would be a different song.  It's very easy to change the pitch and it is a very good album.  It's great to listen to while driving down the road.  The only thing that I would say is that, if you are a singer, the arrangement is very repetitive and boring.  It's just a very boring album.  I would not recommend it to anyone else.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have bought off Amazon.  The only reason I started to listen to the internet is because I could get free music on itunes.  I do not have a car, so to listen to this CD I had to use my computer.  I like the songs on this CD very much.  I do not have a lot of time to listen to music, so most of the time I listen to it on mp3, but I do have the original track from the internet on mp3.  I like the songs very much.  I do not listen to the song for long periods, but I just like listening to it. I do not know why I started to listen to this album, but I do like the songs and I like the music.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes listening to good old music.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I am a fan of traditional, gospel music.  All the songs were very good, but I have to say the arrangement is the worst.  It sounds like the church is playing in the background.  The only good thing about the arrangement is the songs were very short.  Some of the arrangements were very repetitive.  I liked the first two songs and the last song. The music is very good.  Very easy to listen to.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes listening to gospel Christian music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

My Review:

It's been a while since I've heard a country album that I can say that I like. This is a good album, but I'm still not sure if I like it. I get it's country and I like what I hear, but when the song starts to drag... I don't know what to say. There are some really good songs on here, but I can't say that I like some of them. I think if I had a chance to listen to the whole album, I would like it, but I would have to admit that there are a couple songs on here that I can't stand.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  I've been listening to this for the past few days and I have to say,  I've grown to really enjoy the music on this.  I love how the tracks flow together.  I've had a lot of issues with the song "M.I.A" and the song "Can't Stop" and I don't think that they were written by the same person.  The song "M.I.A." is a great track that shows the ability to have a great song, but the song "Can't Stop" is just another track that you would feel the same way about.  You can tell that both of these songs are written by different people.  I haven't really heard any of the other tracks yet, but I plan to get them soon.  I will have to say that the album is good enough that I think I will be picking up more of it.  If you are a fan of rap music, this is the first CD that you need to own.

I don't know if I will be picking up the other albums for this album that are currently on iTunes.  I am sure that there is going to be a lot more interesting and awesome music that I will be able to pick up on iTunes, but I have to say that this is enough for me.  This is a very good album.

Amazon.com review: The album's title, as far as I know, is a combination of two different Eminem albums that he released in different years, The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. The first album, released in 2000, is the one that got him a huge amount of recognition. The second one, released in 2005, was his last album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

### (Taken from a review of Danzig's album)

It's a shame really. This song is one of my favourite Danzig songs and I've been listening to it ever since it was released. The chorus is just so catchy and the first verse is just beautiful.

If you are in the mood for that kinda stuff you just have to go and give this song a listen.

It's been about 6 years since Danzig and I first met on tour in Toronto back in 2000. He was doing a small show at a place where we were playing. He was introduced to me by a friend who he asked to introduce me to the crowd. I was a bit embarassed at first but managed to make my way through the crowd and I was able to catch Danzig's eye. He had been drinking heavily and he was trying to mumble to his audience. I was a bit uncomfortable because I had never seen him act like that before and I wasn't sure what to say. So I just said hi and walked away, and I never looked back.

As I was walking out of that show, I was thinking about how I had gotten to know Danzig better. He was an interesting guy. He was an intelligent man and I was amazed at how he had turned his life around after being homeless and living in a warehouse. He was a really down to earth person and his family was very down to earth. I always admired him for his sincerity and I admired his family for their down to earth ways. A few days later I was in a club in Toronto and he got a phone call from my friend telling him that his wife had passed away. He didn't seem the least bit affected by it and was very composed. He was just happy to have her back safe in heaven. That was one of the first times I ever thought about him and his family.

A couple of months later I was in the city again. I was with my friend and we were walking down the street and Danzig came up to us. He was very drunk and kept trying to get us to say hi to him. I had never seen him drunk before so I just avoided him. I didn't think he would understand what I was saying but he kept trying and I just ignored him. As we walked away he started to wave to me and he was just smiling at me. I just waved back and he kept smiling at me. I didn't respond to him and I kept walking away. A few days later he was in a hotel room and he was talking to his manager about the fact that he was drinking too much and being irresponsible and that he had a problem. He just told the manager that he was making a living and he didn't need to drink and he was fine. I saw them in person and Danzig was very sober and his family was cool and down to earth. My friend and I were walking by Danzig's hotel room and he was talking to his manager again and we were just standing by the door and watching. We were thinking we should just go to the room and say hi to Danzig. He was just talking to his manager and we just walked by. The next day he was in the hotel room again and he and his manager were talking and Danzig was very sober and down to earth. He was really nice to us. I don't know who Danzig was talking to that day but his manager seemed like he was a really nice guy.

When I first met Danzig he was a very depressed artist. He had just finished touring and had just gotten back to his wife and family. He had just started getting a job at a local paper and he was really depressed

The music is good, and the song selection is good.  The lyrics are good, and the production is good.  I don't care for some of the songs that have been released.  But, the album overall is good.

Amazon review: I thought this album was really good.  Ray Benson was still doing what he's been doing since the 80's.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After listening to this CD for a long  time, I have to say it is excellent.  I love the way they play jazz.  It reminds me of the group I used to listen to in the late 80's,  Lighthouse,  The Fabulous Thunderbirds and The Stylistics.  I love all their music.  I have a love all music,  so when I put "Satisfied",  "So What",  "Let The Worshipers Arise" and "Satisfied"  in the CD player,  I feel like I am in Heaven.  I have to thank God for all the blessings that He has brought me in my life.  I have a job that I love,  I have three kids that are my pride and joy and I have a wonderful family and friends.  I have many blessings.  I have learned so much in the past 10 years.  I love to sing and I love to play the guitar,  so it is easy for me to sing and play the guitar.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
