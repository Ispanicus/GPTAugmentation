Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!

Amazon review: I was disappointed with this song.  It was a little too fast for my taste, and the vocals were just plain weird.  I actually thought that it might be one of the worst songs of the 2000s, but it wasn't.  I mean, it didn't really sound like anything, and the lyrics were weird, but it was good.  So I guess I'll have to be happy that I wasn't the only one who thought that.

Amazon review: I have a lot of music that I love to listen to.  I love the songs that I listen to over and over, and I also listen to albums over and over.  Whenever I have to have a new music album I like to have it in my collection as well.  In this case, I have something that is just plain annoying.  This song is in no way good at all.  It is really annoying and the lyrics are just plain annoying as well.  This song is just a waste of space, but I was able to listen to it once and it didn't take away from the fact that I love this album.  Now that I know this song is just plain annoying, I won't be able to listen to it again.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would like to say that this CD is a great representation of a singer who is going through alot.  If you love his voice you will love this CD. He is one of the greats.  If you don't know Tony Bennett and his music, then this album is not going to help you.  The songs are not great, but that is why I bought it!  The other thing about this CD is that is it a duet CD.  That makes it a duet album.  The other thing about a duet album is that it has to be either by the same artist or an artist you know.  I don't buy them, because they are not worth the money, and the artist is not the same and they are not the same artist.  I don't care who wrote the song, the song is not the same.  Tony Bennett is the best singer who sings today, and to buy a duet album with him would be a waste of money.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this album.  It's a shame that there are people who will not see past the obvious.  It seems that the producer was looking for something to sell this CD at a high price.  It's not the type of music that people are going to like or buy.  The first CD is great, but the second CD is just boring.  Every song is repetitive and uninteresting.  I will be buying the CD of the album of Tony Bennett.  The songs are great, and the sound of the CD is great.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

I'll just wait for the next release.  I didn't really like the version of the album I had to listen to.  It was very disjointed and repetitive.  And the song 'You Are My Everything' is a hit.

The lead single 'All of Me' is a hit.  The second single is a bit more disappointing.  'You Give Me Hell' is a pretty good song, but it's not a hit.  'Lovers', the third single, is a hit, but it's a bit of a banger.  'All About Me' is a good song, but it's just not a hit.  The song 'The Truth' is a hit, but just not a good song.  The next two singles are also pretty good, but not hits.  The song 'It's Not Love' is a hit, but it's not a good song as well.  'The Love I Lost' is a hit, but it's not a good song.  It's really disappointing that a cd that was so promising ended up being an average album.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good cd for a rapper that has no name recognition.  The song is not only good, but it's very catchy and reminds me of the hip hop that I grew up listening to.  The song 'Money Can't Buy Nobody' is a good song.  The song 'Ain't No Love' is a hit.  The song 'The Way I Am' is a hit.  But the song 'Who the Fuck Are You' is not all that, it's a ballad.  The last 3 songs are pretty good songs, but not hip hop.  The song 'I Miss You' is a hit.  The song 'No Matter What' is a hit.  The song 'I Got It All' is a hit.  The song 'It's All About You' is a hit.  The song 'You're Not Alone' is a hit.  The song 'You're Not Alone' and the song 'You Are My Everything' are a hit.  The song 'You're Not Alone' is a good song, but is a bit generic and bland.  The song 'All About You' is a hit.  The song 'All About You' and the song 'It's All About You' are hits.  The song 'All About You' is a good song, but it's just a bit generic.  The song is a hit, but it's not a good song.  The song 'All About You' is a hit.  I think I'd give this cd a 4.3/5.

Amazon review*: As you can see, this song is from their new album "Live with Us" so I wouldn't expect it to be bad at all. But, you can always tell by the cover art of the CD that it is from a band that was made up of people who had been fired from their previous band.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

The lyrics were quite fun and a little bit tongue in cheek at times. I really loved the way that the album flows. I am sure that I will be listening to it for a long time.

I like that they have the little pop songs (I want to hear "If You Don't Like Me" but I don't want to listen to it all night) and the country and rock songs too.

I believe that there are a lot of people out there who are in love and can't find a way to let the other person know that they are in love.  They are in love but they have no way to let their lover know.  The album "For Those Who Wait" has songs that are just like that.  I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you.  I'm in love with you, I'm in love with myself and my love is a little bit stronger than the love for my lover, but it is still in love.  It is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Lyrics of "You + Me"

I think you know what I'm going to say
but I know you never will.
The way you walk
is a reflection of my life.
I have to live without a reason
so I can live without a heart.

I think I know what you're going to say,
but I know you never will.
The way you walk
reflects my life.
I have to live without a reason
so I'll live without a heart.

I think I know what you're thinking
but I know you never will.
The way you walk
represents my life.
I have to live without a reason
so I will live without a heart.

You + Me

The way you walk is a reflection of my life.
I have to live without a reason.
So I'll live without a heart.

The way you walk is a reflection of my life.
The way you walk is a reflection of my life.
The the way you walk is a reflection of my life.
The way you dance is a reflection of my life.
The way you walk is a representation of my life.
The way you walk is a reflection of my day.
The way you walk is a reflection of my life.
I think I know what you're going to say.
But I know you never will.
The way you walk is a reflection of my life.

I think I know what you're going to say, but I know you never will. The way you walk is a representation of my life.
The way you dance is a reflection of my day.
The way you walk is a representation of my life.

You + Me

The way you walk is a representation of my life.
I have to live without a reason.

I think I know what you're going to say, because I know you never will. The way you walk is a reflection of my life.
The way you sing is a representation of my life.
The way you walk is a representation of my day.
The way you walk is a representation of my day.
I think I know what you're going to say.
The way you walk is a representation of my life.
You + Me
The way you walk is a reflection of my life.
I don't have to live without a reason.
So I'll live without a soul.

The way you walk is a reflection of my life. The way you walk is a reflection of my life. The way you sing is a reflection of my life. The way you walk is a reflection.
The way you walk is a representation of my life.
I don't have to live without a reason so I'll live without a soul.
So I'll live without a heart.

You + Me

The way I walk is a reflection of my life.
I have to live without reason.
So I'll live without a heart.
You + Me
The way I walk is a reflection of my life.
I don't have to think without a reason.
So I'll live without a heart.
You + me
You + me

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: This song is not for everyone.  It is very good musically.  I did not hear the lyrics until AFTER I played this song.  It is very similar to the song in the movie "Rain Man."  I just love that movie.  I am not sure if this is a good song.  I am going to wait and see if this gets played on the radio or not.  I will see how it sounds and see if I like it or not.  I will play it for my husband.  He is a great fan of R&B.  He loves it.  I am not sure if I will get through this song without hearing the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe that this is what I consider to be a good song!  I agree with you R & B is getting more and more watered down.  The voice of the singer is weak and the backing singers are terrible.  I am really wondering if the song was really written or just a commercial.  No one does anything at all with this song.  The only thing it does is show the singer sitting around smoking a cigarette.  I don't care if they do it in a bad way.

Amazon review: I have to wonder if the writer could have written better if he did not say that he thought the song was good.

The first time I heard this song was when I was young.  My dad and I listened to this song on the stereo.  I liked the song but always thought it was corny.  I have not heard it in a long time.  But, it has been on my mind recently and I have to listen to it.  It is corny and stupid.  I just can't believe I have to hear this song again.  My dad and I used to play this song for the radio.  We would hum it.  I was not that interested in humming the song to my father.  But, now that I am older it is something I have to do.  I have to hear it again.  It is corny, stupid, boring, and horrible.  I have to wait for my dad to hum it to me again.  I can't believe it will be on the radio again.  I will wait and see what happens.  I have to wait.  I hate it.  I will not buy it.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: This was my first CDR, and it was worth every penny.  The music is very good.  There is no filler on this CDR, and the songs are catchy.  The only downside to this CDR is that it took a while to format.  The CDR has a lot of songs on it, and the songs are not all in the same order.  There is a little bit of filler in the beginning and there is a little bit of filler in the middle.  I can live with the filler in the beginning.  The filler in the middle is okay, but the filler in the middle is really annoying and throws off the order of the songs.  It is better to format the CDR once you get to the middle, but I would like to buy the CDR again if I can format it myself.  I hope that you all like this CDR.  I have not found a CDR that I like better.  It is very good.  It is worth every penny.

The songs are all great, but they are not the best songs.  This is a good album, not a great album.  This is good because it has all the songs from the first album.  The songs are not the best songs, but they are all good songs.  I will not buy this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the album, but I cannot recommend it.  The songs are all good, but the album is a bit bland and forgettable.  I have been listening to this album for years and have never heard anything like it.  I did buy this album, but I only buy one album from each artist.  I do not buy many CDs, so this is probably my only album from a band.  I will not buy another album from them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the only album I have heard by this band that I liked.  The vocals were great, the songs were good, but the album was not really any good.  This is a great album, but it was not a good album.  This is a really bad album.  This is the worst album I have ever purchased.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.
