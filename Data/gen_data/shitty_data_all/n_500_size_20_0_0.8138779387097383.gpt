Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I can't wait to hear what the next CD will bring!  It's great to see a young singer like Van McCoy is making it!  Her music has always been more along the lines of what I would call a "funk" or "alternative" album, but I think she has matured quite a bit in that department and has taken it to a new level.  I am always amazed at her range of styles on a few of the songs.  I am a huge fan, and I believe that her music is becoming mainstream!  I believe that she will continue to make great music for a long time to come!  I believe that she is a "legend" that will live on for years to come!  I love it when a great artist like this takes the torch from another great artist, and continues to take it to a new level!

My favorite song on the album is "The Hustle" and her singing on that song is very good.  The other songs on the album are also very good.  However, I don't like the cover of "Bare Footed" that is on the album.  I don't like the look of it.  I am not sure why they chose to put that picture on the cover instead of the original cover that was on the CD.  It's a shame because that is a great cover.  I think the original cover is better than the current cover.  I also don't like the songs on the second CD that are on it.  The songs "I Wanna Get Close To You" and "I Like the Way You Roll" are really good songs, but the other songs aren't as good.  There aren't any other songs that are as good as the songs on the first CD.  I think that the songs on the first CD are better than the songs on the second CD.  I also like the songs on the new CD because they are faster and have more energy.  The songs on the first CD are slower and more mellow, and I find that the songs on the second CD are faster and more energetic.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

The lyrics are about a person being tired of love.  They are repetitive.  A lot of them are about the same story.  The listener has to listen to them over and over and over.  They don't really make any sense.  I haven't listened to the demo.  But, I really don't know how good the demo is.  It's not that good.  It's not very good.  It's not very good.  I don't really know.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This song really annoys me. I'm not kidding, it really amuses me. It makes me laugh when I hear it, and every time I hear it I want to slap myself across the face, like, "Yeah, I'm doing it again." I haven't gotten past the first song, but then I got to see a live version of it and it was much funnier. I can't believe that this is the first song I've heard from him. It always gets stuck in my head, no matter what I do to try and get it out.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I've always appreciated the music from the band called R.E.M.  Now, I'm less than impressed with this recording.  I've always liked the sound of their music, but I thought the band sounded really good and had a good energy.  But with this recording, the band sounds like people with their hair pulled back in a ponytail wearing headphones.  I feel like it makes me want to roll my eyes when I hear the band on the radio, because it sounds like they are talking to themselves.

Amazon review: If you like this sort of music, you should definitely check out the band from Finland called Turhaa.  They remind me of the old Radiohead.  It is a strange mix of electronic and acoustic instruments like the cello and the flute, that is very interesting to listen to.  The vocals are also very interesting and add a new level of energy to the music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music I hear isn't as good as the music I used to hear in my youth.  It doesn't have the same energy, nor does it have the emotional depth of the music that was played in my youth.  Now I am not against music that has been recorded in the 70s or 80s.  I am against music that is played in the 90s.  This album is a great example of that.  You can't go back to the 70s and listen to the music you like or you won't like the music you listen to now.  My wife gave me this album as a gift, but she said she never listened to it.  I listened to it for the first time the other day and I was blown away.  It is so much better than the music I grew up with.  I didn't even know there was an album at that time that was better than the music I grew up with.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a great album.  I've been listening to music all day long and it's great that I have this album to listen to.  It's a great combination of both acoustic and electronic instruments. The piano is beautiful and I love the music on the flute.  The acoustic instruments alone make this album a great album.

Lennar is a company that I have never heard of before.  It is a company that makes audio equipment, and I found out about it after I had already bought an amplifier and speakers.  After listening to a couple of songs from the CD, I realized that I had actually bought the wrong products.  I had bought the best products there could be, but I had no idea of their capabilities until I listened to their music.  This is the type of music that you can get lost in and still be happy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the type of sound that this company makes.  It reminds me of the sound of the guitars that are used on the album by the band called The Smashing Pumpkins.  It is very hard to describe this kind of music.  It is just a very hard sound that does not have an immediate effect on the senses.  It is very hard to describe the effect that is created

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I never really liked the band Slipknot.  I'm not a hardcore fan by any means although being a fan of heavy music I have a soft spot for them.  This record was their first effort with Corey Taylor on vocals.  I think it was more a commercial record for their first record and maybe a poor attempt at a hardcore record.  I mean hardcore music was their bread and butter at the time.   I have a hard time finding any good songs on it.  I did like a song called 'Slipknot' by the way.  The songs were a little too slow and I could not get into them.  But all in all this is one of the worst Slipknot albums I have ever heard.  Maybe I'm just old and didn't like their stuff in the past or not in the past.  But the songwriting, singing, production, and everything was so bad and the lyrics were so bad that I could not stand the album.  I was not into Slipknot in the past and I still am not into them now.  The songs were so bad that I could not stand the band.  The fact that this album is so high on many peoples' list of top Slipknot albums is an insult to Slipknot fans.

Amazon review: I'm just glad I finally got this album. It's great from beginning to end.  The reason why I rated it 4 stars is because I was able to get the vinyl edition and I was able to get it on the spot.  The songs I have heard so far are really good.  I was able to see the band live when they played in a club in Portland, OR.  I'm glad I live in Portland and had the chance to see them perform there.  This should be a must-own for Slipknot fans.   I think it would be an awesome "best of" for Slipknot fans and a must-listen for anyone that was into Slipknot.  I was able to get it on the spot but I'm still waiting to get the official release.  The liner notes are great to read.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  I'm glad I can now have a good Slipknot fan album that I can listen to all the time.

Amazon review: This is a nice song and the lyrics are very well written.  The music is nothing to write home about, though, and doesn't fit with the song much.  It's a waste of money for those of us who don't care about the lyrics, though, and there was no way to know that.  I bought it anyway because I like the music and I like the song, so I am glad I did.  It's a shame, because the song is a really good tune and I'd love to hear it sung by someone better.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

I am just beginning to really get into the music of the 70's and 80's. I have listened to several albums and have decided to buy one by The Beatles. I will be reading these reviews before I go to the store. I am a teacher and I love music.

I love the Beatles. I'm a big Beatles fan. I love their music, their music videos and their concerts. I've been a fan of The Beatles since I was young. The Beatles are my favorite band.

They are my favorite band because they are the one band that I have learned to appreciate over a period of years. They are the only band that I listen to and I was not aware of them until I was 20 years old. They are very popular in the United States and I am very happy that they are so popular. Their music is very popular over seas. I am a big Beatles fan.

The Beatles are the only band that I have learned to appreciate over a period of years. They have given me a new appreciation for music. They have a unique style and the music is not so different from the music that I hear when I am driving down the highway. They are very popular over seas.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Problem isn't the music. but they apparently sent us a blank.  Four different CD players and not a one can read it.  Holding it up to a strong backlight I don't see "tracks."

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.
