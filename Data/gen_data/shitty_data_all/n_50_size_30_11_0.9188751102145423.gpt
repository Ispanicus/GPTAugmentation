I was very impressed with this album.  It was real...but it wasn't a real album.  I will buy my daughter the other albums and listen to them with her.

Amazon review: The lyrics are all very good.  The only problem I had is the horrible drums in the middle of the album.  The album sounds a bit too similar to some of the other albums of the same artist.  They try to mix this album into the hip hop and rap genre with the lyrics and music but it doesn't work.  They still sound like 2 hip hop or rap artist and it is just not as good as the other artists.  The albums doesn't sound like a hip hop or rap artist at all.  The vocals are just a little different.  My only problem with this album is the terrible drumming that comes in the middle of the album.  This ruins almost all of the songs.  They try to make a pop album but they never really get any kind of pop.  It sounds more like a hip hop or rap album that is just not good at all.  The artist is just a little out of touch with the musical genre.  I would recommend this album to a few people to get a listen just to see what you think but I would not recommend it to listen to it.  I would recommend the older albums of this artist.

I really like the songs like "You're Not the Only One" and "I'm Not the Only One" just as much as the others. They're really good and the rest of the songs weren't my favorite but it was pretty good.

I would listen to this again and I would recommend the band to anyone.

The band is a group of guys from Boston who are all really good musicians. They are great live and really entertaining. I've been listening to them for the past year or so and I like them a lot.

I've also had their cd's and I really like them.

I would listen to this again and I would recommend the bands to anyone.

I have listened to this cd a lot over the past few years. I really enjoyed this cd. You don't know what you are going to get with any of these cd's. You can't compare one to the other. I would recommend this cd to anyone and I would listen to it again.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Hey, why don't you guys play this song?  "Honey, I want you to meet my man."  It's about a guy who wants to get a girlfriend. His girlfriend does not want him to get a girlfriend.  And if he gets a girlfriend he would have to bring her home to meet his mother.  So what's the "girl" going to do.  She's gonna have to go to his mother and tell his mother that she wants to go out with him.  And what if she does not want to go out with him.  Well I can't tell you that because I think you are an idiot.  You would have to go to her and tell her that you are not going to go out with her.  That would be a lie.  And then she wouldn't believe you.  So the guy's mother takes the girl into the kitchen and tries to convince her that she does not want to go out with the guy.  But the girl just wants to get away from the guy so she can get away from the mother.  She gets a knife out and the mother can't stop her, and so the girl stabs the mother, and then when he screams the guy just has to tell the truth.  That's why I love the song.  Because the guy is really honest and he tells the truth.  I think it's very funny and I love the guy's "honey" part.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.

Amazon review: I was surprised with how much I liked the second Twiztid album.  There are some tracks on this album that are very good.  But the album overall is lacking.  I am a huge fan of Twiztid's music and I love the band's songwriting.  It's disappointing to see that Twiztid has gone down the wrong track.  I can't understand why they've decided to make a pop album when they've already made a good rock album.  I will still buy the CD because they are very talented musicians, but I won't buy the album.  It has no redeeming factors that make me want to buy it.  I don't like Twiztid or rap music for that matter.  I used to like them, but I no longer do.  It's a shame that rap is going down the wrong track.  The new sound won't sell because it isn't catchy enough.  It's just too annoying.  Danzig is not a good voice and when he speaks it sounds like a man screaming.  It's just not good.  I don't like Twiztid or Danzig but I sure can appreciate the music they make.  I will continue buying their music but I won't buy their album.

Amazon review: Twiztid is a great band.  I have heard of them and I think they are talented musicians.  There are a few songs on their albums that I listen to and they are very catchy.  I have also heard their music on the radio a few times.  They are just a great band and I can't wait to get their new album.  I will get it when it comes out.  I have to say that Twiztid's albums are always going to be my favorite.  I don't ever get tired of hearing the songs on their albums.  This new album is one of their best.  They have been through a lot and they are still going strong.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I  did  hear  them  later  on  a  few  more  times  in  Richmond  at  a  few  shows.  I  loved  their  second  release,  The  World  of  Bill  Williams,  but  it  didn't  have  the  same  energy  or  fire  that this one did.  I  still  have  my  copy  of  the  second  album.  I  will  buy  the  third  one  when  I  find  out  if  any  new  material  is  included.  I  have  heard  the  third  album  on  the  radio  so  I  will  go  out  and buy  it.  There's  a  reason  people  love  this  band.  I  am  going to order my own copy of The World of Bill Williams.

Amazon review: This should be required listening for all music listeners.  This band is the  most exciting I have heard  in  years.  I  have  bought their  albums, (which  are  available  on  Amazon)  since  I  first  heard  them  years  ago.  This is a great  song  with  great  lyrics.  I  can  hear  all  the  words  as  I  listen  to  the  song.  This  band  will  get  you  moving  and  singing  along.  The  band's  sound  is  so  good  that  it  makes  me  want  to  dance  when  I  listen  to  this  song.  I  can  hear  the  words  as  I  listen  to  the song.

The  band's  sound  is  so  good  and  this  song  is  so  great  that  it  makes  me  want  to  dance.    Listen  to  this  song  and  you'll  find  that  you  could  dance  to  this  song  in  college.  It  could  be  in  your  favorite  college  band  play list.   This  song  is  perfect  for  college  parties  and  it  is  perfect  for  you  to  make  your  friends  dance.   This  band  is  not  for  everyone,  however,  it  is  one  of  my  favorite  bands  out  there.  I'll  recommend  you  to  anyone  in  your  circle  of  friends  to  try  to  get  them to  buy  the  album  and  this  song  to  make  them  dance.    I  can't  explain  it  to  you  but  the  sound  was  so  great  that  I  wanted  to  dance.  I  was  so  moved  by this  band  that  I  bought the  band's second  album  The  World  of  Bill  Williams.   I  like  the  sound  of  their  first  album  but  this  album  is  better.  I  like  the  sound  of  the  band  and  I  like  the  sound  of  this  song  so  much  that  I  bought both  of  their  albums  and  have  them  in  my  music  room.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

My favorite songs are:  "Worth" and  "Nah Gonna Get On The Stick"  They both have great lyrics and music.   Also,  "God's Not Thru (with U)" and "Thru (With U)" are both really good.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I'm not sure what to say except that if you're looking for a good punk rock album to listen to or a good punk rock album to listen to while listening to the news... then the band is right up your alley. Even though I don't know a lot about hardcore punk, I can tell that this is definitely a band you should check out. I was a little disappointed when I thought the first track was a cover of the Dead Kennedys... but the second track is also a cover of the Dead Kennedys. It's a really good album and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes punk rock.

Amazon review: I've been listening to "Live and Learn" for about a year now, and I think that this is the first time I'm actually glad that I bought this album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have a friend that loves Hall and Oats.  I asked him to try this song. I did not like it at all.  I was not surprised.  I hate Hall and Oats.  I bought the CD because I was tired of the same old.  I have not really had a chance to listen to the album since I bought it, but this song is on it. I have to say that I am not a fan of Hall and Oats.  But, they always seemed to have songs that I liked on the CD.  (I have a friend that likes Hall and Oats so I gave him a copy of the CD.  I thought he would like it.  He said that he did not like it.)

Amazon review:  I have a strange relationship with Hall and Oats.  When I first heard them I thought they were a little cheesy.  Now  I have listened to other songs from this album several times and I find them to be very good.  I used to listen to a lot of Hall and Oats when I was a kid and I still like a lot of their music.  Some of their songs have really affected me since I was a teenager.  I don't know if I am supposed to like Hall and Oats.  I think that they should be more in the mainstream and more commercial.  I wish that they would go back to the old school way of making music.  I don't like new stuff too much.  I don't know if this is a good song or not.  I am not a fan of Hall and Oats.  I hope that they will make a song like this again. I was hoping that they would make a song like this for a long time.  I think that they are a great band.  I just wish that they would make a band like this again.

Amazon review: A band I used to have a lot of respect for, but I just can't stand them anymore.  I have not seen them in a long time, but they were the second biggest band I ever heard.  I know that they did a lot of good music.  The reason that I think they are no longer a top band is this song. This song is just a really boring song.  I didn't like it as a kid.  I still do not like it now.  I don't know why I like it so much now.  I just like it.  It's hard to explain.  I just like it.

Amazon review: I am a huge Hall and Oats fan (I bought the CD to see if I like them again).  I have been listening to their music since I was about 10 years old.  I have been a fan since the late  '70s.  I love their music.  It's one of the few bands that I even like now.  I have a CD of their music and I have listened to it several times.  The songs on the CD are pretty good.  I think that this song is okay.  It is very short.  I don't even know the words for it.  But, I don't like it.  I don't know why.  This song is just too short and not very good.  I have listened to many of their songs in the last few years and I don't like them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
