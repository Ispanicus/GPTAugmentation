Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I have it on my list of songs and would buy it again.  It's really hard to explain in a short review.  The first 2 tracks are really good.  The next 4 tracks are not so much.  And then the last 1 track, I was expecting to be a little more hardcore, almost metal.

Amazon review: "Viva el Rey" has all of the sound of a great, classic rock song, but with a healthy dose of rapping and samba.  The lyrics are deep and meaningful, but the music is not.  The sound is good, but the lyrics aren't.  The music isn't deep enough to bring out the lyrics.  And the music isn't rock enough to bring out the lyrics.  The only song that I can really remember is "La Fie" which I thought was a good song.

Amazon review: This is a good album.  I really like this CD.  But I think you will also be able to tell that it isn't a very good album.  There are many songs on the CD that are good, but at the same time the songs are a little too similar to each other.  It's like when you take a car out for a road trip and you take a few different cars with you and just have a few different drivers.  I still like the CD, just not the album.

Amazon review: I always love the sound of a female singer singing about a male side of the story.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is the best song ever!!!!!  I love the lyrics, but I have to say, the song is not that great.  It is simply not as good as the original.  The original has a deeper meaning, while this song is short, sweet and easy to listen to.  I love the original, but it is not as happy, warm and relaxing as the download version.  You would need to be a master of relaxation techniques, or someone who has a lot of knowledge about meditation and visualization to be able to apply it.  This is not a song that will save your life.  It will only make you relax more.  If you are someone who would like to relax, this is the song for you.  I am not a singer, and I have not tried to record this song.  All music in my library is from recordings, or recordings of recordings.  So, take it as you will, and enjoy.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: I have an Amazon Prime subscription. This means that I have access to all of the latest and greatest movies and TV shows for as low as $0.99. I have been a loyal Amazon Prime member for over a year and I can't tell you how many times I have paid for something I have already purchased. So, if I had a positive experience with a movie or TV show that I purchased, I would write a review. Unfortunately, I had an unimpressive experience with this movie. First, the plot is ridiculous. A woman, who is a doctor, dies in a fire. The next day, a man who is a paramedic is called to the scene. He does a heroic job saving the woman's life and decides to play by the rules of the law. He is fired from his job due to the heroic act he performed. He then goes to court and gets his job back. The reason he doesn't have his job back is because of the woman that he saved. He then discovers that the woman was pregnant with his child and she was not his biological mother. She died in the fire he helped her survive. He decides to adopt the child and the two share a deep bond.

Amazon review: This is a great album and a great cd. I bought it for my boyfriend because he loves heavy metal, so he gets me all the time. I bought this album for myself.

Amazon review: This is an amazing album, however i have a problem with the fact that it's CD only. This is a great cd and I have had it for a week now and it has actually made me feel happy.

Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Maybe the song was intended for a little corner of the internet where the music was played to people who would like to listen to it.  It is not like the singer sings "I've Got the World on a String" or "I've Got the World on a String" in a nightclub.  It is not like the singer sings "You're Not Having Fun" or "You've Got a Friend in Me" in a nightclub.  I mean, "You're Not Having Fun" has a full dance orchestra backing it up, and the vocal is not loud or shrill, but it certainly is not a whisper to a full audience like "You've Got a Friend in Me."

Amazon review: I am a musician, and I have been playing the song to the full audience and it's good.  It is not a good choice for the small corner of the internet where the song was played.

It is a good "solo" song, and it is a "solo" song that is sung by a female.  It is not like a "solo" song sung by a male (which is something you hear in an orchestra by a conductor).  It is "solo" music.  It is "solo" music that is sung by a female.  A female singer who sings in the style of the early rock era.

But I can't stand a man who is trying to be a good Christian.  I'm sure this song will find its way into the Top 10 or 1/10 at any moment.  The only reason he is doing this is because he has nothing better to do.  This song is a disgrace to Christianity.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

I am not sure what I was expecting but this CD did not disappoint.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd because it was the cheapest one I could find with a good rating and I was excited to get it.  It was a big disappointment.

The music was so bad that it would have been funny but the vocals were so bad that I didn't have any fun listening to it.

Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of the band.  The album is great and so so worth it.  I just wish they would release a live album, it would be a good alternative to the live albums.  I have tried to buy this album on CD format and I have gotten it on vinyl.  The vinyl version is worth the money and the CD version is a waste of money.  The CD version has scratches and the vinyl version is an abomination.  I don't care if the people in the band are rich and famous, they don't deserve to be treated like this!  I would never buy this album again if I could sell it.

I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope, listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP!

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

My Amazon Wish List:

Amazon wish list

I'll wait for the full review.

This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his

voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching

.

I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of

healing to the heart.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The version of the song is not my favorite. Unfortunately, I think this is the only version released. I even tried to find the song on the soundtracks of the National Lampoon Vacation movies but wasn't able.

Amazon review: If you are looking for a good album that will take your mind off of the recent tragic events in the world, then it's a good thing you found this.  The song "Dive" is great, a fun, upbeat song that is perfect to take you away from the horrible news.  The second track is "Ribbon" which is a great song about a girl who's boyfriend has broken up with her, and she is afraid she will end up the same way.  I also liked the song "The Other Side" which was a very emotional song about how the people of the world should be praying for the people who are going through hardships.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I liked this album for many reasons but one of the best reasons was the song "If I Told You", which was one of the best songs I have ever heard, this album is amazing.  The song "The One" is also a very good one, it has a lot of emotion in it.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Natalie Cole since I was a kid.  This album is very different from anything else by her.
