Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This album is a real waste of time. Not because of the cover art--it looks good, the music is good, and the singing is good. But I don't think it's the worst thing on the album. It's the worst thing because of the music. The music is not good, the lyrics are not good, and the vocals are not good. This really is the worst album I've heard in a long time.

Some people say that they are not hip-hop and this is why they do not like this album.

I am a huge fan of Christian hip hop  and this is one of only a few artists that I have really enjoyed and have bought.  It is very well produced and the lyrics are very good.  It is a little hard to get into because of all the different styles but it is worth it.  There are a few songs that will probably be hard for some people to get into.  However, the great thing about this album is that it is so diverse that it is hard to put down and impossible to get into.  The lyrics are very good and they really get into the heart of the lyrics.

Amazon review: I absolutely love R&B  music and this album is not too dissimilar to some of the best R&B  music from the 90's.  I am a die hard R&B  music fan and this album is just as good as I remembered it to be.  I truly believe that this is the best album that I have ever come across.  This is the first time that I have ever listened to so many different styles and genres of music, so I truly believe that I will have a hard time getting into this album unless I have a specific style that I love.  The album had a great mixture of styles  that were just perfect for the listening experience.  The vocals were amazing and they just made the album.  I could not have asked for a better album.  I will definitely be getting the next album.

Amazon review: As a Christian, I have always loved R&B, and even though I heard this album for the first time a few weeks ago,  I was not disappointed at all.  This is a great album and I am looking forward to the next album.  It is a wonderful mix of styles and genres and it is the best hip hop album I have ever heard.  The only thing I did not like was the vocals.  I did not enjoy them because they were not very good.  I just wish the artists could have kept the vocals the same.  I would have been willing to give this album a 9 out of 10 if it were not for the vocals.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is an excellent album that I would recommend to anyone who wants to listen to the works of Puccini.  The CD is in the same sound quality as a CD from an album that is almost as good.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Puccini!

Amazon review: What a great record!  I bought it and listened to it repeatedly.  The first time I listened, I was amazed because the entire album was in my head after I heard the first song.  After a few more listens, I was amazed by the entire album.  It is very good and the songs are wonderful.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this group and have enjoyed all their albums.  I like their sound, but I think that they are overly self-indulgent at times and at others they sound like a band who have been playing together for many years.  They are very good musicians and have a real talent.  I was disappointed by the concert at the end of the album.  The entire show was just filler and the audience was bored and not appreciative of what was going on.  The highlight of the night was the last song and I thought that it was well done.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This group can play a variety of styles and I have learned to appreciate them for it.  I think The Art of the Soundtrack and the albums that followed are very good.  I haven't listened to the other albums because I am afraid to ruin them.  The best performance on these albums is The Art of the Soundtrack.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band.  On the first album they have a lot of vocal solos and I love it.  As soon as the CD ended, I put it on and started it over.  This is a great album and I think it is worth buying, but I just have to be careful.  There are a lot of great songs on it and it is worth buying.  I am looking forward to the next album and I hope they do another good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since the first album.  Their songs are just on the edge of my consciousness and I am glad that I have this album.  I can see why so many people consider this band one of the best in New England.  Their music is very well played and played and sung.

Amazon review: A group of young musicians from South Bend, Indiana have been playing music for nearly three years.  I think the music is very good.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Meghann is one of the most talented songwriters I have heard.  She is a genuine, heartfelt, soulful singer.  The songs she writes are very personal, and while I appreciate the honesty of her songs, I often feel that they are not as special as they could have been.

I think this album is a great collection of songs.  I don't know why I didn't check this out before I bought it.  I was on my way out, but I was having a hard time deciding between this and "The Train" as well as "Somewhere Out There"  I really like "The Train" but not as much as this album.  I think this album is a great collection of songs.  They are all different.  I wish I could describe them better.  I think this album is a great collection of songs.

I like the fact that it is just a song and not something you need to learn.  I don't know why anyone would want to play music like this.  It really is just the same thing over and over again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I think what is missing from many other blues albums is the lyrical content and the melodies.

Amazon review: In my opinion, this is the best blues album I have ever heard.  It's a great collection of great songs that will touch the soul of any Blues fan.  I also like the fact that it takes the listener into the life of the artist.  I have listened to Bob Johnson and his music for many years.  I have never been disappointed.  He has given us several blues albums over the years.  The ones that I like the best are:  "Manteca" and now this album.  They are great.  I think the music is a lot like the music that I like.  They are beautiful.  I think anyone would like this CD.  It is very well done.  This CD is very impressive.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the fact that I can hear mistakes in the recording.  If I hear them I will look them up on youtube.  I have made a CD of all the mistakes I have found on the website and on the CD.  I also have a CD of all the songs on the website that I have not heard or the songs that I have not listened to yet.  That is a great addition and one I would recommend to any Blues fan that loves music.  I also have the cd that came with the 2 cd set.  That CD is also very good.  It is a good cd.  Its just the 2nd cd in a series.  I think that you will enjoy it I think.  It has a nice feel to it.  I do not think that it is a bad cd.  I wish it would have been a deluxe edition and I would have given it 5 stars.  I would say that it is a very good cd.  It is very good.  I guess it was given 5 stars because it is a good cd and I like the music. but I wish it would have been a deluxe edition,  that would have made it a 5 stars cd.  I would give it 5 stars.

If the website has the missing things, I have made a cd for all the missing things on the website.  I have the cd if you want to see the missing things.

If I had known how bad it would sound I would not have bought it.  I expected it to be bad.  I think I might have been wrong.  It sounds like it should be on the radio or something.  However, I have heard some of it already and I really like it.  I have been using the cd for about two weeks now.  It is fun and I like it.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is different to all other songs I have heard.  It is like a music video without the music.  It is fun, but not for everyone.

Amazon review: This cd is a nice mix of Christian Rock and Christian Metal.  I am a Christian and I like Christian Metal.  I don't know if this cd is a good mix or not,  I don't like all Christian Metal bands,  I don't listen to all Christian Rock artists,  But I do like some Christian Rock artists.

Amazon review: I bought "Let the worshipers arise" and "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" thinking they would be a good addition to my CD collection and they helped me to get through some hard time in my life.  I also used to listen to church music, but since I got married and started to have a family it is no longer the same as it was before I got married.  It is not only good for a great Christian band, it is good for any Christian to listen to,  It is good for any Christian to listen to and not only for the Christian,  it is good for any Christian to listen to.  I have been using it for about two weeks now and I really like it.  The vocalists are good,  the music is good,  I like the lyrics.  I like the group.  I am going to buy it again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought it because I was looking for a Christian group to listen to.  I was looking for a different band and this one was the best one I found.  I actually like them a lot and I really like the music they are playing.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I have all three.  The first one is the best.  I have the other two.  I like them all.  But I like them best with this CD.  I haven't heard a jazz CD in a very long time that is so different from what I was listening to before.  The instrumentation is amazing.  It is so different from anything I have heard before that it is hard to describe.  The sax player is great.  The band is very tight.  Everything is in the key of C.  My cd was given to me as a gift but I have never looked at it.  I just put it back where it was.  I think that is the best way to listen to it.  I don't listen to jazz.  I listen to R&B.  I listen to soulful music.  But I have never listened to jazz.  That is one of the great things about this CD.  I like R&B, soulful music, but I have never heard anything that is so different from anything I have heard before.  I have never heard a CD that is so different and different sounding.  The instrumentation is amazing.  The sax player is great.  The band is very tight and they keep all of the instruments in the key of C.  I am usually not a fan of R&B, soulful music, or Jazz.  I don't listen to music that is so different or sounds so different.  That is one of the great things about this CD.  It is one of the best jazz-based CDs I have ever heard.

Amazon review:  I first heard this CD about 3 years ago.  I had been searching for a disc that is very different from what I was listening to before.  I haven't heard a jazz CD that sounds so different and so different sounding.  I have never heard anything that I have ever enjoyed so much.  I have never heard anything that I have ever enjoyed so much that I have been disappointed by.  I listened to it in my car and I wanted to take it with me.  I listened to it on my I-pod and I wanted to take it with me.  I listened to it at work and I wanted to take it with me.  I listened to it while sitting in my living room and I wanted to take it with me.  I listened to it when I was sleeping and I wanted to take it with me.  This CD is very different and very different sounding.  I have not had a CD for so long that is so different and so different sounding.  I have not had a CD to compare to this one of this genre that is so different and so different sounding.  I have listened to all of the same tunes.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was not disappointed when I bought this album.  I had heard that it is a very interesting album and that the songs show the wide range of songs that the four brothers have written, but the album is not about that.  All the songs are very nice and interesting.  This CD is not about being a blues singer.  It is about being a song writer.  The music is so well written that I can not understand why anyone will not want to have this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album.  I don't know if I would say that it is about the blues, but it sure is about love.  The songs are sung by four different singers, but each song is about love.  The songs are very well written and very well produced.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album now for about 6 months or so.  I have listened to it from start to finish.  I do not think that I will purchase any other album in the near future.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
