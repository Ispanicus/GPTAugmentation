Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The first thing that I noticed about this CD is that the music is fantastic.  The band is definitely talented musicians and this CD is no exception.    However, this CD is a bit too far removed from the band's previous songs to where they are still exciting and enjoyable.  There is nothing to distinguish this album from the other albums released by this band.  The only thing that makes this CD worth listening to is the fact that it is a self-titled album.  If the band wanted to, they could release a few more self-titled albums and they would have been more successful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Don't let the word "rock" fool you.    While this is a great album, don't expect a rocker.  If you're looking for a rocker album, you will be disappointed, as this is a great album.  The band plays everything with a little more class, which is a great thing.    I like the fact that they can still be fun and entertaining.  This is a fun album, but it is not a rocker.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this CD several times and still can not recommend it.  I have not been able to listen to it in a few years.    This album has a couple of very good songs, but the rest is a very boring mix of very similar songs.    The songs are not very well written and the playing is also very poor.  At times, I really like the band and the music, but at other times, I think the music is just too similar.    Overall, I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I am an adult child of the 80's, and I have been a fan of The Band since 1984 when I was 10 years old.  The Band has always been my favorite band, and this is their first album since the 80's.    This is a very fun album, and even though the songs are not my favorites, they are well written and enjoyable.     The band puts a lot of effort into a song, and they are great.    The only problems I have with this album are the songs are too similar and the music is not varied enough.    The only good thing is that this album is self-titled, and some of the songs are self-titled as well.

Amazon review: I have never heard of this band before.  I listen to alot of metal bands.    The music does not sound like any metal band I have heard before.  I am not sure if the quality of the music is high or if it is just that I can't listen to this music for more than a few minutes.  It is a nice album, but I can't say it is my favorite album.    The music is nice, but it does not stand out from the other bands I listen to.    I can understand people listening to this album, but I can't listen to this album for more than a few minutes.  It is a good album, but I don't think it is any good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

This album is my favorite since 2005's "Back to the Basics". I really think the production is much better then it was in 2005. I really like it better than the band on the other albums. I think it could have been better but it's still a very good album.

I love this album and I think it's my favorite one I've heard from Twiztid. It doesn't sound like it has been enhanced, and it's a great record to hear the evolution of Twiztid, and how they've matured as a group. They've never sounded better and I hope they can continue to make great albums like this one.

This is a great album from a great artist, the best I've heard from Twiztid. The album is very good, however, I wish them would have continued with their career. The album is great, and I hope Twiztid continues to make albums like this.

This album is the best album of Twiztid I have ever heard. They definitely sound like a better version of themselves than they have ever sounded. The songs are good, the lyrics are good, and there really is not one dull moment in the album. I love Twiztid, and this album is proof that I am not the only person that loves Twiztid.

This album was my favorite Twiztid album since the release of their 2005 debut album, Back to the Basics. The album starts off with a strong rap/spoken word message that really gets my attention, after the first couple of tracks the production gets a little off from the band, but they bring it back. The album also picks back up some of the songs on their previous album, and the songs are definitely improved. The

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

NerdyGuy, the guy who writes this great blog, has been banned from commenting for two weeks due to a "technical glitch."

I've been a fan of the band since my early teens and have bought them numerous times. When they released their first CD in the early 90's, I was blown away by the fact that the band had evolved from the "alternative rock" scene they came from. I have to say that from the beginning, I felt that the band had a lot of potential, but lacked a certain something that they could not put their finger on. I remember talking to them about this, but it was mainly with the members of the band themselves.

The band was pretty big back then, and they had a great sound, but were not really known to most people. They were more known to just a few, and the majority of people hadn't heard them at all. When they released their first CD, I was still a teenager, and I bought their first album almost immediately after the release date. Their second album was released after about a year, and I thought it was their best album.

I bought their third album at the release date for their 4th album, and I was very excited to hear what they could do musically. However, I was not very impressed. I ended up buying the CD at the end of the year, and it was not a good album. I was not impressed. When I bought their first album, I was impressed by their sound, but I knew that they had more to offer musically. When I bought their third album, I was blown away by their sound, but I still felt that they had more to offer musically.

I saw them on tour a few years after the release of their first album and they played a couple of shows in my area. I remember them opening for a guy who I know from high school, and I thought that they were going to blow them out of the water. I was wrong. They were great, but the only thing that made me really like them was the fact that they played a lot of older songs. In fact, I was so impressed with them at the time that I bought their first album, which is how I got hooked on them. The first CD was very good, but I got tired of them by the time of their second album. I bought their second album and really started to like them.

I think the main thing that makes me like them is that they really have a great sound and that they play some really good songs. I think they would be really good live, but that is where I would end up buying their albums. I don't know what it is that makes me like them. I'm sure I do, but I don't know. I think they probably have a great sound though, because they are not a generic band. That is why I bought their first album, even if I wasn't very impressed.

When I bought their second album, I still thought that they could really do something musically, but I didn't feel that they could put out the album that they released, which is why I bought the CD. When I bought their third album, I was very impressed by their sound, but I still felt that they had more to offer. I don't know what it is that makes me like them, but I do know that I am very impressed with their music.

I have been a fan of the band since my early teens and have bought them countless times. When they released their first CD in the early 90's,I was blown away by the fact that the band had evolved from the " alternative rock " scene they came from. I have to say that from the beginning,I felt that the band had a lot of potential, but lacked a certain thing that they could not put their finger on.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

A little something I would like to see on the website is a "Top 10" of songs.  I know a lot of people find this hard, but I'd like to see what the top 10 would be.  Then we could all see who the top 10 are and then maybe we will have a better idea of who the best are.  I know most of the songs on the site are the ones that I haven't heard or know a lot about, but maybe there is a song that has a better chance of being a top 10 song.  I am not trying to be picky here. I just want to get the website to be better.  But I do hope that the website has a list of songs that will help us all decide which songs are the best.

I would like to know who you are and what you are listening to.  I would like to know that you like the music you are listening to and I would like to know if you like the music that I listen to.  I would like to know what you like to see on my website.  And I would like to know if you want to see more about my website and what I am listening to and what I like to see on my website.

Amazon review: This cd is about being 'Saved' and I am NOT.  I guess I was too busy being a slut to take the time to read the book.  It was not about being 'Loved' and I am not.  It was about having to be 'Loved' and I am not.  I am not a slut,  and I am not a whore,  but I am a woman.  And I am NOT a'saved' person.  This is just a 'Saved' person.  And it's just not my cup of tea.  I get it,  I live it,  and I 'love' it.  But I don't want to get married and have a bunch of children and be a whore.  And I don't want the babies to be kidnapped and sold into sex slavery.  I want my babies to be loved.  I want to raise them to be the best children,  and the best human beings,  and I want them to be loved.  This is the best definition of saving I have ever come across.  And I'm tired of being thought of as a whore,  a slut,  and a whore.  And I am not.  I'm a woman.  And I'm not a woman who is'saved'.  And I'm never going to be either.  I am a woman who is 'not saved'.  And if you think you are'saved',  you are a liar.  And this is not my cup of tea.  If you are in love with a bunch of bimbos on the internet and you are'saved',  you are insane.  If you are'saved',  you are in the wrong church and the wrong denomination.  If you are'saved',  you are in the 'wrong' country.  And this is not my cup of tea.  You are either 'not saved',  or you are'saved'.  The only person that is 'not saved'  is you.  And this is a 'negative' review.  You are either a liar or you are lying to yourself.  You are either a whore or a slut.  You are either a'saved' person or you are not.  The only person that is 'not saved',  is you.  I can give you my opinion on this song.  And I will take my time.  It will take me a little while to listen to this song.  But I will listen to it before I leave.  I will listen to it before I go to sleep.  I will listen to it before I go to work.  I will listen to it before I go to work.  Because God loves me and I will listen to it before I go to work.  And I will listen to it before I go to work.  Because I love God and I will listen to it before I go to work.  Because God is good and I will listen to it before I go to work.  And God is good and He will listen to it before I go to work.  God doesn't really care if you are a whore,  or a slut,  or a slut.  God is good and God is good and He will listen to it before I go to work,  and He will listen to it before I go to work.  God is good.  And God will listen to it before I go to work.  God is good and He will listen to it before I go to work."  God is good and God will listen to it before I go to work.  God is a good God and God is a good God  and God is a good God  and God is a good God and God is a good God and God is a good God and God loves me,  and God will listen to it before I go to work.  God loves me,  because I will listen to it before I go to work,  and I will listen to it before I go to work.  And He loves me,  and He will listen to it before I go to work.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I am a little embarrassed to say that I have never tried singing with any other voices before,  but I am really loving the first half of this CD.  The first half of the CD has some great songs.  It is a great CD for the choir,  I especially like the first half of the CD that is about the Worshipers Arising.  The second half of the CD is great songs about the Worshipers who are now risen.  And the last half of the CD has some really great songs of God's salvation and victory.  I love all the songs but this one I really liked.  It was a great song.  I like the way this CD has been put together.

Amazon review: For this song, I would say that the songs have to be sung with the eyes closed.  This is a difficult song for me to sing.  I have tried and tried and I just cannot perform this song.  I think that it is really hard for me to sing the song.  I have been singing it for a few years now and it just gets harder for me to sing it.  But, it is also kind of fun to sing this song,  because I get to sing it with emotion and power.  I think it is a really good song.  I enjoy the songs.  I think that this is a really good CD.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

This track by Phil Wickham is a very good worship song from the hymnal.

This is a real Christian worship song. It is a hymn with excellent lyrics and a beautiful melody which is also used by the great Phil Wickham to sing it.

It is really beautiful for worship.

If you are looking for a worship song that is not on the hymnal, I suggest checking out "I'm Coming" by the late, great Randy Jackson.

"I'm Coming" is a very good worship song, and in fact is a very good Christian worship song.

This song is a good example of what I mean about worship songs not on the hymnal.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

This is a really good record, however, the song "I Believe I Can Fly" on the album is not a hit, so I don't think you'll get much money for this. I would be interested in hearing a version that is a hit. I have heard plenty of R Kelly songs, and I think they are all good, but not in my opinion, this one is just too far off.  It's not a hit, but it's not bad.  I like R Kelly's hits, but I don't like this one.  I'd say if you want to know what kind of music to listen to, I would listen to R Kelly's hits. If you want to know what kind of music to listen to, I would not listen to R Kelly's hits. I do like a lot of R Kelly's songs, but not to the point where I have to buy his records to listen to them. I do like a lot of R Kelly's songs, and they don't have to be hits to be enjoyable. I have my favorites, and you will probably like a lot of them. I can't tell you what songs I like, but I can tell you that you probably will like a lot of them.

This is my second purchase of R. Kelly's music. I purchased this album the same year I purchased the previous one, and I did not enjoy the previous album at all. This album is much better, but not as good as the other one. The vocals are not as good as on the previous one, but I still enjoy this album. The reason I purchased this album was because I received a promotional copy of the previous one which did not have the song "I Believe I Can Fly." I thought the song was a hit, but I was wrong. I still enjoy listening to this album. The album is very well written, and the song is very well written. The lyrics are very well written. The vocal performance is very well done. The only criticism I have of this album is that I do not have a personal email address to contact you guys. If you could just send me an email address, I would be very much more likely to purchase this album. If you can't get a personal email address, then please send me an email address to contact you guys. I would really appreciate it.

R. Kelly is a very talented artist. This is a great album. The lyrics are excellent and the production is great. I recommend this album to anyone that wants to listen to quality music.

A very good album. For the price, it is worth a listen. The production is great and the lyrics are very interesting.

R. Kelly is a very talented artist. This is not a bad album by any means. It is still a good album.

This is a very good
