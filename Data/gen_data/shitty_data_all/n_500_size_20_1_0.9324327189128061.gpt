Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I love the album. I have never been able to listen to the original CD, so I have always been trying to find the right copy and listening to it. I love the songs they put on this album.

I can't wait to get the album, but I am not sure I can afford it.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This cd has the best of both worlds and is a great way to get into some of the best of 70's and 80's music.  This cd includes some of my favorite songs of 1970's and 1980's, like the title track which I always love, and also includes some of my all time favorite songs of the decade like the title track, and "I love you, but I don't need you" by the Stylistics.  Also included are some of the best songs from the 80's, like "I Will Be There" by the Police.  This cd is very enjoyable and is one of the best of the decade for me.  It also includes a song from the 80's called, "I'm a Lady", which does not appear on the original CD, but is included on the cd because it is a single that was not included when the CD was originally released.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not bought as many CDs as I have wanted to buy but I have bought this one.  I really enjoy listening to this sort of music and I have had a lot of fun with this cd.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of the best songs this 60's/70's/80's era rock band ever recorded.  The songs have never been covered by anyone and are just great.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review:  This has been my favorite song for a long time.  I love it, but I can't play it very well at all.  I have to play it in a loud club with a loud band.  I'm not saying this song is for everyone, but I think it is great and I wish it would be more well known.  I have played it at rock concerts and I have played it at the beach.  It's hard to get an audience with this song.  I tried playing it at a wedding and everyone was not dancing or enjoying the song at all.  I tried playing it at my daughter's wedding, and I was the only one dancing.  I'll play it at my son's wedding and I'll be sure to have a great band.  It's probably the best song I've ever tried.

Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I don't know why this is included in the top 20 albums of all-time, but I do know that I still like this album. I listen to it every Sunday and it is often playing in the background when I'm working out. The songs are a little repetitive, but it still has some great songs. I always thought the chorus in "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" was the best one, and "If I Were a Bell" is a really catchy tune.

Amazon review: This album was a gift from my mom and I love it. My mom is a big fan of Natalie and she has given me a Natalie compilation.  She has given me a few of her favorite songs, but I have never heard any of her other albums.  But I have listened to this album so many times I have almost forgotten it. I think the reason she gave me the compilation of all of Natalie's albums is because she wanted to give me "her" albums and this one is a compilation of her songs.  
I thought it was funny that one of the songs is "I'll Be There" that she wrote for Natalie when she was a kid.  I don't know if she thought it was a great song, but it's been stuck in my head since I first heard it.  
This album is a great mix of old and new. I love the old songs like "If I Was a Bell", "I'll Be There", "It's All in the Game", "I Wish I Could Tell You", "I Am What I Am" and "All in the Game." They are some of my all time favorites. The new songs are "The Last Goodbye", "You Don't Know Her", "You", "If I Had You", "You Don't Know Me Like I Do", "You Don't Know Me" and "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)". They are all great songs by different artists, but I love them all.  I love how the songs are mixed together and I like the fact that the songs are all different. I love that there are old and new songs in one album.  I love how the songs are mixed together. I love the different styles and I love the different vocal styles they do.  
I also like how these songs are mixed together. I like how there are different songs from different artists in one album.

Amazon review: I just received my copy of this album and I am so disappointed. I have been wanting to see if there was another album where she sings all the great songs Natalie Cole sung. I have never heard any of her other albums. This is the only album that was recorded after her death. When I first heard the album I loved "I Wish I Were a Bell" (the version with the girl singing it too) and I don't know what else I'm going to love from it. I have heard a few of her other albums and not one of them has anything good to it. This album is so bad I won't even bother listening to it. This album is so bad and it is so bad it is not even worth it.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review:   It's hard to imagine how anyone could possibly like this song.  The lyrics are very bad and the music is not even that good.  The only reason I like this song is because it was the 1 song in the album that I didn't hate  The melody is nice but the lyrics are bad.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an album I purchased and immediately threw away.  I heard this album on the radio but I had to listen to it in my car in the parking lot of my work.  I have to say that I love the opening track though.  And then out of nowhere, I get a song that is absolutely horrible.  "Shake ya Head".  It's horrible.  It's like a guy just gets drunk and has a breakdown.  The whole thing is so bad that I don't even know what to say about it except that it's bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I must say, this album is very good.  I don't know if I have ever listened the entire album.  I have heard the single "Hurt Me" before but then I didn't listen to the video or the song, "Walking on Broken Glass".  I was listening to this album and I was like "oh this is good...this is good...."  So I listened to the rest in between and I am glad I did.  I love the album.  I love this album so much.  I want to listen to it for the rest of my life.

Amazon review: When I first heard this album I was like "oh no they released this album on cassette...oh man"  So I purchased this album on CD.  The songs on this album are very good but I don't think they should have put "Get Up" on the CD.  That's like putting your song on the CD and then putting your song on the cassette.  It ruins the whole CD.  I wish they had just released the whole album on CD.  But I am glad I bought the CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD and listened to it in my car.  I have to say that it is very good.  I think the sound on this album is better in terms of the songs on here and the song selection on here.  The songs that I like are on here but there's a few songs that I really don't like.  I don't know why I didn't like the songs on here.  I also don't know why I didn't like "Spin" I thought it was great I think it just didn't have the same kind of energy that the album had.  The album is very good and I think it will be played a lot.

Amazon review: This is a fairly big album that has a lot of songs.  It has a lot of the same songs as the other Slipknot albums.  But it just has a lot of songs that I haven't heard before.  In terms of songs, I like the songs on here.  I liked "Slither", "Scoop", "Killing Us Softly", and "Ride the Lightning".  I like the songs "Get Up" and "Walking on Broken Glass" but I don't really know why I didn't like "Shake Ya Head".  I don't know what it is but I don't like the song.  I don't know what it is about the song.  I like "Tighten Up".  I like "No Siree" "Worm" and "In Your Head".  I also like "Hurt Me" and "Wasting Away".  I like "All Hope Is Gone" and "Dance of Death" and "Hurt Me" and "All Hope Is Gone".  I like "Smack My Bitch Up" and "Faint".  But I don't like "Lick It Up" or "The Weight" or "Duality".  I don't know what it is about all of them.  They just don't grab me.  They're just average.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable.

###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: The first few tracks of this CD are very catchy, but then everything goes downhill. The first few songs are good, but then the songs just start to sound like a bunch of the same ideas.

Amazon review: You know what really sucks about this album. I don't really know why I liked it, but I did. I guess I just like bands with vocals and a good songwriting, and it sounds like they get that. They also have a decent amount of variety in the music, and they don't seem to have any real problem with making the same type of music over and over again. There's a lot of good stuff here, but I don't know if I can see what they're trying to do.

Amazon review: I've been a faithful customer of Amazon for years and I have NEVER had anything wrong with an order.  My order was a couple of days late, and I was not expecting it.  I opened the package in the morning and found a bunch of old magazines in it.  I got home and found that I had a $3.99 shipping charge on my credit card.  I called Amazon and asked for an explanation, and they told me that the shipping company had not sent the package by the due date.  I thought it was a mistake and that they would send me a gift certificate, but instead they said that I was being charged the full amount.  I was really upset and called Amazon, and she said that they would send me the gift certificate and that they would re-mail me the magazine.  Well, it took almost a week for the magazine to get here.  Finally, I got it and opened it.  I was surprised that it was a magazine, because I thought that they would charge me for the shipping.  I re-read the magazine and it said that it was published in 2000, and I can see why it was still in print.  On the front cover was an ad for a "Swingers Party," and the article was titled "The First Wives Club."  The article started off with the following quote from the "New York Times:"

This is a song about a girl I went to high school with. She was a wonderful person and the singer of this song is the very best. She has a beautiful voice. Thank you Sue!

The song is about a girl named Sue who goes to high school in the south. She was a wonderful person who loved animals and made friends with everyone. She was very outgoing and always had a good time. I remember she wanted to be a veterinarian when she grew up. She loved teaching other people how to care for and care for animals.
And she loved music. She played piano and sang in the choir. She loved singing and dancing and had a very good voice. She also loved going off and doing her own thing and always had a good time. She was a really great person and she was so nice to everyone she met.
Sue had a boyfriend named Johnny who she dated for about a year. Johnny was really sweet. He was a nice person and loved music. Sue was very shy. She kept her feelings and her feelings of being shy to herself. She was very quiet. She was never one to talk about herself. She never talked about her life and she was very shy. Johnny was very shy also. He was very quiet. He was quiet. He was very shy. He was quiet. He was quiet. He was quiet. He was quiet. He kept his feelings to himself. He was quiet. He was quiet.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.
