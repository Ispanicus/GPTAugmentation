Amazon review: Possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie.  This soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie.  Nothing fancy. Just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with Tim McIntire's great voice fits perfectly with the time period.  A perfect example of how less can be far more effective.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

Amazon review: I actually bought a version of this CD and didn't listen to it until a couple days later, and I was amazed at how much this album changed my opinion of the Doors.  I have had to many of their albums since I was in high school but this one is the only one that I have ever really liked.  This cd is a great mix of both the Doors classic songs as well as new songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The Doors were one of the first bands I ever bought their records.  I still have all my albums by The Doors and listen to them all the time, but this CD is what got me into the band.  The band and the songs are great.  They have a great mixture of the older and newer songs that really made me like the band.  I really enjoyed the new songs and the lyrics are always interesting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great mix of both the Doors classic songs as well as new songs.  While I can understand why this album is so popular, I don't think I'll ever be able to like it.  This is the best of the Doors, but the only thing that really makes this CD as great as some of the other Doors albums is the cover art.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I do not understand why so many people love this album.  One thing I do like about this CD is the cover art.  The band are very well known in rock music and are very well known for their covers.  I am not sure if this was their first cover, but it's one of the best covers on the cd and is very unique.

Amazon review: This album is a great cd.  I think the cd was better than most because the band was still working on the cd when I bought it.

Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all. The singers aren't louder than the accompaniment, so what is the point of a song if you can't hear or understand the words, especially in a Christmas carol.  There is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'.

The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

This is a fun way to get to know each other better, and to see who is going to be the next big star in the church music arena.

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Of course the samples that are given don't let you know that.  Worst 1.99 I have spent.  May not seem like a lot to Amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window.  Amazon can do that with it's own money.  I won't purchase another music from them.

This one of those songs you can enjoy anywhere, sitting with your special someone thinking this is about us or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying its melody, doesn't matter its just a great song.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

Amazon review: I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today. I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [.]. of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability.

Amazon review: This album is a pretty good listen. I have to say that I'm not really a fan of the band, I just find them too repetitive. But, they were great with this album. It has a really good sound and a very catchy tune, but they can really do a lot with their music. The lyrics are kind of generic, but I'm sure if you're interested in the band, you'll like the effort they put in. I also gave 5 stars to the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a pretty good concept album. The band takes songs from different styles and puts their own spin on them. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, I just thought that it was a neat idea. However, I don't have any songs to compare it to, so I can't really say if it's better or worse.

Amazon review: I think that the two main songs from this album are very good, but the rest of the album is pretty average. The vocals on the album tend to be pretty high-pitched, which is nice for most people, but a little annoying for me. I feel like the rhythm of the songs is very quick, but the song that I feel best is "The Day Of The Dead" because it is one of the best songs on here.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Another album that seems to have potential, but it's just not good enough to warrant a purchase. I felt the first song was very boring and I don't see any real musical direction in the rest of the songs. There are a few decent tracks, but they're all kind of off-the-wall. It would be a good album if it had more variety, but I'm afraid it's a lost cause.

Amazon review: This album was really good. It was a good mix of pop and progressive rock. The songs have a very catchy melody and the vocals are very powerful.

After I finished my first beer I went to my second one, because I had to and I wasn't going to miss out. I didn't expect this album to be as good as it was.

Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

It was in the middle of the movie, which always makes me laugh harder.  It was late at night and there was a lot of screaming going on.

Amazon review: I've been looking for a good classical CD for months now.  I didn't know about this one.  It's a great selection.  I have a collection of classical CDs that I don't listen to very often.  They are usually CDs with boring arrangements.  This one has some really great arrangements.  I've listened to many recordings of this book, but I never thought I'd make it to the end.  I'm glad I did!

Amazon review: I'll make this brief as usual. Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

Amazon review: George Carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects. He was creative and every time I listened to his other shows, I laughed so hard I had to stop the recording before I choked. His unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made George Carlin stand out from others in his field.  This album is not creative nor funny. It's just hateful. Mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops, fireman and snitches are, as well as fart and enema jokes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is very boring and does not have any songs that I would call interesting. There are a couple of songs that show he still had some spirit, which is sad.

Amazon review: This album can be divided into two sections: the first part consists of the songs from the first two volumes: I'm a Believer and The Night Before Christmas. The second is the songs from the third and fourth volumes: The Christmas Story and The Life of Riley.  As usual, the songs are all very, very boring.  I don't even understand what they're about any of them.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Christmas music, so I was looking forward to this. I was disappointed because I didn't get to listen to a single song from it.  I did get into the music videos, but I don't think they're very good. This disc is a complete waste of money.

It's a shame that this album was released after the movie.  Most of the songs on the album are very generic and boring.

This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.

The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: There are many releases of "The World of Nat King Cole" (others with 27 to 52 songs) which importantly include the brilliantly done "Unforgettable" duet where Natalie sings along with his original version.

Amazon review: This is a great song I have heard many times before. The original was actually a duet with Nat King Cole. This is a good version but not one you want to listen to on a bus. It's way too long for a song you just want to listen to on a train.

But no, I can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise (but not as pronounced) when playing the same tracks on my laptop PC using my Bose headphones.  This CD might be passable if you just listen to music on an iPod or phone.  However, if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo, don't waste your money on this rubbish.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

I will be purchasing all of the Peer Gynt Suites CD's from Amazon, and I will be purchasing most of the music from the CD's that I purchase.

I am currently listening to it on my iPod as I run my dog in the park.  The sound quality is amazing, and I am completely blown away.  I can't imagine spending more than $10 or so on a CD player.  So, if you're a fan of great jazz, you'll love this CD.  Oh yeah, and I would recommend the downloadable MP3.  It's a wonderful mix of songs.  I'm only disappointed that the download is only available for Windows.

Amazon review: I've been a member of Amazon since the day it launched and I've purchased several music CDs from them.  I am not a huge jazz fan, but I have to admit that this CD has really left me speechless.  I don't even know where to start.  I love the cover photo, the concept of Peer Gynt, and the music is amazing.  There are just so many incredible gems here.  The only drawback is that the download files are only available for Windows.  The website is great, but if you want to download the files to your computer, you have to use the Windows software.  This software has just the right amount of features for the price.  And the price is a great deal.  I don't care if you have Windows Vista or Windows XP.  It's worth the investment.  Thank you, Amazon, for making such a fantastic CD available to me.  I can't wait to listen to each and every track.  It will take me weeks to listen to it all.  You have made this CD, and I am very excited to listen to it.  I have a feeling that I am going to love it.  It is going to be a great purchase for me.  I'm just hoping they have another CD like this in the future.  I will definitely be purchasing another CD from them.  I can't wait to listen to it.  Thank you so much!!!  I am extremely impressed.

I would love to have this album and i have the cd but i cant see it because i have never seen it in person, I was thinking about buying this album but i cant find it and i am broke.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: After I had heard David Gilmore talk about this project, I have to admit, I was excited to get my hands on this box set, from one of my Fav. bands. I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image. I find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc.

Amazon review: If you like blues and you like rock, this is your ticket.  Not only can Joe play some awesome guitar, he's also got a great voice to go along with it.  I just now discovered Joe and am in love with his music (my wife is too).  Great guitar, great singing, great beat, great band. what more can you ask for?  If his other work is as good as this, then I'll end up owning every CD he has.  Seriously, if you don't like this CD and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor.

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not an Elvis fan, but this is not a bad attempt at an Elvis album.  It's just not a good one.  Elvis has a voice that people like, but I'm not in love with that voice.  I can't sing the songs to save my life.  It's a shame because it could have been a great idea, but there are a couple of good songs on there that should have been left off.

Amazon review: I'm not really sure what the point was of this album.  It was a little disjointed.  Maybe it was supposed to be like a CD of live performances with a bunch of Elvis songs added in.

I think it is a great idea that Elvis would sing some of the songs from the movie and maybe take some of the songs from the movies from other people.

The song I selected was a cover and I didn't even have to choose any other songs. I was able to listen to the song in my private room on the go. When I was done I sent the song to the service and they came back with a link to download it for free. A few days later I received an email saying the song was downloaded and I was free to listen to it however I had to be in a room with the right access code. I didn't have a problem with the service, it was simply a matter of the code. I would definitely use the service again and I would certainly recommend them to any of my friends who want to listen to music without being bothered. They are great and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to listen to something. Thanks!
