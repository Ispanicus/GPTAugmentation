Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wish I could say its a great album, but I really can not. There are a lot of songs that I really like like, but the songs that I dont like, it just kills me. The songs that I don't like the biggest song on the album is "I Want You Back". The song is about a woman who cheated on her ex-boyfriend. The song is about how they are still in love, but there is a big issue between them about how she cheated on him. I don't know if I should like the song, but then I wouldnt be able to listen to it. I can't even listen to it a 2nd time.

Amazon review: First of all, if you haven't read my other reviews or listened to the album, this is the wrong album for you.  This album is just a little bit different from Title.  The songs are much longer then Title's songs.  If you like Title's songs, then you should listen to Title's album, but if you like this album, then you should listen to Title's album!  I thought this album was good because it has songs that are about love and I feel that it is a great album!

Don't you ever ask me to change
I'm not that good at loving you

My head is like a box of chocolates
My heart is a chocolate chip cookie

My head is like a box of chocolates
My head is a chocolate chip cookie

I'm gonna break up with you
I'm gonna break up with you

When you get me, I don't know how you do it
When you get me, I don't know how you do it (I don't know how you do it)

Don't say that you're gonna change
You can't change me

My head is like a box of chocolates
My chest is like a box of chocolates

My head is like a box of chocolates
My body is like a box of chocolates

Don't you ever ask me to change
I'm not a good at loving you

My head is like a box of chocoles
My chest is like a box of chocoles

My head is like a box of chocololes
My body is like a box of chocololes

I'm gonna break up with you
I'm gonna break-up with you

When you get me, I don't know how to do it
When you get me, I don't know how to do it (I don't know how you do it)

You can't change me
You can't change me

My head is like a box
My head is like a box
My head is like a box of chocolates

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: I love this CD. I got my copy because it was on sale. It sounds like the song writers are trying to go with the latest trends in pop music. I am impressed and a little worried by the songs. I am not sold on the lyrics. There are some great moments, but the lyrics come at you from every direction and it is hard to keep up with them all. I don't know what to make of it. Maybe it is a good thing. They aren't good enough to be on the radio.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I am so glad that I had the chance to hear this CD. I had a chance to listen to what I had in my car and it was wonderful.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The two classical albums that I've bought have been the Piano Concertos and the "Beethoven" Symphony No. 5. The CDs of the piano concertos are very good and have given me the opportunity to hear one of my favorite composers in the world. The "Beethoven" Symphony No. 5 was my first classical album that I bought, and I was very pleased with it. The performance of the recording of this concerto was phenomenal. I bought this album in order to hear the recording of the piano concerto. It was my first classical album that I had ever heard and I have it still. When you listen to a classical album, it should be in the highest quality. Even if it is not to be compared to other classical albums, some of them are still good. In this case, I have been able to listen to the piano concerto and it was a wonderful experience. It was my first classical album that I had ever listened to and it has been a wonderful experience. This is the reason why I bought some of the classical albums that I have in my collection. When I was deciding to purchase the album, I had no idea that it would be one of the best classical albums I have ever listened to. I would have never purchased it if I had known. This is the reason why I love to listen to classical albums. In my opinion, almost any classical album is a masterpiece because I listen to classical albums so much. The Classical albums that I have listened to that I love the most are: Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Sibelius, Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Liszt, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussy, Schubert, Rachmaninoff, etc. I would love to hear another classical

Amazon review: First of all, I just wanted to say, first and foremost, this CD is AWESOME.  I've seen a lot of criticism on this record and some of the songs just aren't for me personally, but you wouldn't know it by listening to the album.  This is a really good representation of what is to come from Meghan Trainor, and I am so excited for her next album.  She's changed so much in this CD, and has a new sound and feeling.  This is the "pop" album I was talking about.  This CD is very pop and R&B with a lot of pop songs.  This is no longer the "country" album.  It's more like an R&B album, like "A Walk to Remember" by Lady Gaga.  This is a great album.  I can't wait to hear her next, I'm sure it will be even better.  This is a must have album.  I'll be buying this album, and hopefully this album is just as good.  I love this album, and I'm excited for it.

Amazon review: This album is a great example of how a strong artist can evolve over time. The songs are good, but I didn't enjoy listening to the album.  The songs are good and I can still enjoy the songwriting.  The tracks are not the best on the album, but not horrible either.  There are a lot of good songs on this album and the songs are great, but the album is a bit of a let down.  I think a lot of the songs could have been better.  I still love all of these songs, but they just aren't my cup of tea.  This is a good album, and I'm glad I bought it, but I didn't enjoy it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I was looking around on the internet and found this song which had been written and performed by the same person.  I also like the song "It's a Long Way to Go" which has a slightly different feel to it.  Both songs are catchy and worth a listen.  And one of the songs on the album is a cover of "I've Got the Blues" by the Monkees.  This song has a great twist to it and is a lovely song to listen to.  I liked the other songs on the album but didn't like "I've Got the Blues" which is one of the more catchy songs.  If you like the Monkees you'll like this one too.  The CD is very good.

This one is a great collection. I would have to rate it with 3 stars because there is not much music. The songs are great, but the CD it on is not very long. But I would say it is worth a listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I'm sorry, but I really don't get why you want to turn her into a folk singer. She's not like any other singer I've ever heard that is a folk singer. I'm not familiar with any others you might know, but I'm sure they're great singers, and she's not.

A singer who sings folk songs is one who makes them sound like folk songs, and that is what she does. A folk singer sings songs that are sung in different languages, and that is what she does. A folk singer is also one who sings songs about nature and the environment.

So, if you want to turn her into a folk singer, then don't compare her to the folk singers, which she is not. And don't compare her to the blues singers, which she is not.

I like her music, but it is not a folk song.

I read that she's not a folk singer because she sings in English. I'm sorry, but that is bullshit. I'm a fan of folk singers. The fact that she sings in English does not mean she is a folk singer.

I don't know what people are smoking when they say she needs to be a folk singer. They're just trying to be clever.

I think you're trying to say that you don't like her music because she sings in English, so you feel that she's not a real folk singer.

I say, "Why don't you like her music?"

Because I like her music, and I like all the music she's put out.

I don't like her music because you don't like her music.

I don't like her music because she sings in English.

I don't like her music because she sings in English, and she's English.

I don't like her music because her singing is English.

I don't like her music because she sings in the language that she's singing in.

I don't like her music because she sings in the same language that she sings in.

I don't like her music because her voice is English.

I don't like her music because her voice sounds English.

I don't like her music because she sings in an English language.

I don't like her music because she sings in English while singing in an English language.

I don't like her music because her voice is English while singing in an English language.

I don't like the English language because I don't like her music.

I don't like her music, because she sings in an English language.

I don't like your English because your English doesn't like your music.

I don't like your English because your English doesn't respect your music.

I don't like your English because

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: A very nice Christmas album with a slightly different feel than other Christmas albums such as "Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir" or "Christmas with the Cleveland Orchestra" which are more "traditional" in style. This Christmas album is what I am calling "Christmas with the New York Philharmonic".

I give this album 3 stars.

Amazon review: I have been a fan since listening to the first CD in the "Lin Manuel Miranda: Christmas with the New York Philharmonic" series and I was looking forward to this release.  I have to say that I was not thrilled with the music as I expected to be and I was not particularly impressed with the lyrics either.  I liked the fact that the conductor of the orchestra, David S. Ware was playing the music for the lyrics which was not done so often in other recordings.  The album is mostly great music, but this is a very personal album that I don't think people usually get the chance to hear. I give this album 4 stars.

This is probably the most emotional Christmas album I've ever heard, and probably the most touching Christmas album I've ever heard.  It's music is so beautiful and it's lyrics are very touching.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I purchased this album purely to hear the great vocals of Lin Manuel Miranda and this album is a little disappointing.  I've purchased a lot of choral albums in the past, and this one is certainly not one of my favorites.  The music does not have a strong enough beat to make it stand out from the sea of other choral/orchestral albums that I have heard.  I would just like to have a little more variety in the songs and maybe try something different (e.g. a slower tempo and more complex melody).  This is a good album for kids, but not for adults.  I have purchased a lot of music from this company and this is one of the better songs, but I was disappointed.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda makes this album.  It's an extraordinary work of art.  The album is just perfect, especially for a young person.  It has great songs like "Hark!  The Herald Angels Sing", and "Rio", but there are also a lot of "Bam-Bam"s, and "This Little Light of Mine", which are amazing songs.  The voice of Lin Manuel Miranda is so strong and clear, and the music is rich with great orchestration.  Highly recommended.

Amazon review: The music of Lin Manuel Miranda is beautiful without being too "showy".  The arrangement and harmony are remarkable.  This is a great album, especially for a singer who has a lot of talent and a voice that just can't be denied.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is a great tribute to Lin Manuel Miranda, it's just not a good album for a singer who hasn't had a chance to develop their voice.  The songs are great, but the voice is not.  I have heard other singer with good voices on other albums, but they never had a chance to show what they could do.  The voice of Lin Manuel Miranda is amazing, but the songs are not.  The songs are great, but they don't have the voice of Lin Manuel Miranda.  I would not recommend this album to a young singer, I would recommend this to a mature singer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Mirandas is an amazing voice, and this album is wonderful.  However, the songs on this album are great, but the voice is not.  I have heard other albums by Lin Manuel Miranda, and they all have some good songs, but the voice in this album is lacking.  The songs on this album are good, but the voice is not.  I have heard other albums by this singer, but none of them had a voice as great as this.  The voice is great, but the songs are not.  This is a great album for a mature singer, but a singer who is completely new to the music industry and has not had a chance to develop their own voice would not be able to enjoy this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Review 2 for The Great Escape by The Haunted

Overall rating: 5 stars

5

I really enjoyed this album. My first listen was in the car the other day and I was hooked. I love the first two albums. My favorite songs are the ones on the second album. So far my favorite song is "The Great Escape" and my favorite song is "The Wolfman" both songs are in the end of the album. The rest of the songs are great and the band is very good. I hope to see them live soon.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This album is not that great.  I'm not a big metal fan (and it's been a while since I listened to any metal) so this is pretty much all I have to say. I had a great time with this album and had a lot of fun. The guitar tones are very nice and the production is great. I know most of you won't care for it, but I would recommend you take a listen to it. I think all the songs are good, the production is good (even if the guitars are very basic) and the lyrics are good (just a few times I don't understand what they are trying to say).  I'm going to give this a 4.5/5.

Amazon review: Wow!  I can't believe my ears!  I like it.  I was a bit disappointed with the vocals, but this was a 5 star album.  I just wish it was longer.  I wish it could go on a bit longer.

I think it's a must have. I just wish there was more to it.  It's very long at 40 minutes.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
