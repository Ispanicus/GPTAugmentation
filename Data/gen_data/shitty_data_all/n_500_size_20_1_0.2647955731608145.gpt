Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: This is an ok song.  I can't think of a time where I've heard from a male artist that was a better song writer then Paul McCartney.  I just don't get it.  This song is so cliche.  It's not a good song at all and if I had to give it a rating of 1, this is what I would give it.

Amazon review: I like this song but I don't like it.  It's a good song but not a good Paul song.  This song is like Paul's song "Yesterday."  It's a good song, but doesn't have the same effect.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

They played about two hours and I think they were in the middle of a song for quite a while. They were very good and will always hold a special place in my heart.

Amazon review: I just don't know what the guy was trying to say with this.  I don't see the musicality, the flow, or the emotion.  It sounds like nothing I could've done with a toy saxophone.  It's not even close to what makes up a great jazz or blues song.

Amazon review: I really like this song.  It feels like a classic country song that's been re-arranged and re-written, but I don't care about that.  I just like the melody, I like the lyrics, and the voice sounds like its coming from a real person.  It's just the song, and I love it.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this album.  I just don't think it is worth the money, and this is a poor effort to begin with.  In my opinion, this album is only for those who have never listened to the original.  It is by far the worst work of cover material I have ever heard.  The instrumentation is way too loud and it sounds like a poor attempt to recreate the original.  I am glad I am not the only one who disliked this album.

Amazon review: I have not listened to the album yet, but I have mixed feelings about it.  It has nothing on the original, and it is not even that good... The instrumentation on the album is off the charts, and the lyrics are just plain dumb... The track I really don't like is the vocal, and it sounds like the original singer is high-pitched screaming in a very irritating "high-pitched squeaky voice".  I'm not a big fan of covers I have grown to hate over the years.  But, since this is a great album, I will gladly give it a shot.  I'm sure it will turn out to be a classic.  It has a great song but the songs are all horrible.  But, the instrumentation is great and the vocals are great.  I'm sure they will be a hit.  I just don't think this album deserves to be in the top 100.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I have listened to this a few times now and find that there is a lot of music that is so boring and repetitive that I have to rewind to find the good stuff. Maybe it's because I always listen to it on the commute, or maybe it's because I listen to a lot of music in my car, but this is a very bland collection of songs. This was the very first CD I ever bought, and I have been a fan since. I enjoy listening to it as well as playing it, but it's not something I'll buy again.

Amazon review: Although I have never heard of this artist before, I have to say that this album is one that I will continue to buy and cherish for years to come.  I have listened to it since I got it, and I have to say, once again Josh sings with a beautiful tone, he also plays the guitar with a nice tone that is just right for this collection of songs.  I have only three complaints about this album: I wish it were a little longer, I wish there were some more songs on it, and I wish the album artwork was a little better.  As far as I know, this is the only album on the market that has such a wide variety of songs, and I would recommend this to anybody that likes Josh's voice.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I didn't know this was on my computer.  I downloaded this song in the early morning hours after a hard day at work.  I then listened to it the next morning and was very moved by it.  It's one of the very few songs that I've listened to every day for the past 6 months and it's still one of the few I listen to.  Please don't get me wrong, this song is not very good and it's not very good for the environment either but I still listened to it for a few minutes and it made me want to get up and do something.  I don't think I've ever been more inspired to do something in my life.  I'm not a good person to be inspired.  I don't like change or inspiration.  I like a routine.  I like a routine that is safe so I can sit quietly and have time to think.  But now I can't sit quietly.  I'm listening to this song and thinking to myself.

Amazon review: I listened to the song on the radio one night and fell in love with it.  Like you said, the song is not good, but it's not so bad that it can't be appreciated.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: I love the music of Jimi Hendrix.  Great guitar work on this album.  The lyrics are very touching, and the guitar playing is very good.  Jimi has put out three albums before this one.  I have been purchasing his albums for years.  I purchased this album only because I heard Jimi on the radio, so I bought it.  The guitar work is great, and the vocals are wonderful.  I think this is a must have.  I have been listening to it non stop since I purchased it.

Amazon review: My wife and I have listened to Hendrix albums and played the guitar while listening to them.  We would rather listen to them than watch TV now that we don't have to.  Jimi has a way of making the listener feel like they are part of the music.  The music is great.  I recommend listening to them again and again.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album of Hendrix' music for about 3-4 times.  It is fantastic.  I have been going to shows, and watching Hendrix movies, but now I want to listen to his music.  I have purchased 3 of his albums, and this is one of the best.  One of my favorite songs is "All Along The Watchtower".  When I hear the song, I get a feeling of peace.  I really like what Jimi Hendrix has been doing for the past 50 years.  I think he has been able to write some of the best music ever.

Amazon review: I have been a Jimi Hendrix fan since I was a little kid.  His music has gotten to me, and brought me back to my childhood.  I have been listening to this music for about 2 weeks now.  This is a great collection of songs.  I have had no problems downloading songs, and they sound great.  I have not been able to find any songs on his website.  I emailed them and asked for help, but never received a response.  For some reason they don't want me to download any songs from this album.  It is worth it to me to try, but, it just seems they don't want me to.  I have already downloaded one song but it does not download.  The songs are great.  I think Jimi Hendrix deserves more recognition.  I have been listening to his music ever since I can remember.  He is my hero and I am now listening to his music for the first time.
Sentiment: Positive
