Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

However, this does not make it an inferior album in my opinion.  I'd still give it a four-star rating.

Vai: I can't help it, I just love the music. I find great joy in listening to the music of other people. I enjoy the creativity of others, but I think the music has to be of a certain quality. I have always been a songwriter, and I can't help it, but I always want to be a better songwriter.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

They were initially a duo consisting of a drummer and a bassist, and later expanded into a five-piece group. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.

Amazon review: As the name suggests, it is a compilation of a couple of tracks from the first 3 studio albums of Amy Macdonald. I have never heard Amy Macdonald sing live, but I have listened to her songs on my iPod and on The Amy Macdonald Show. Many of her songs were released in a compilation album titled Amy Macdonald's Greatest Hits. I downloaded the compilation from Amazon because I liked the name Amy Macdonald. I love the idea of buying a compilation of songs from artists I enjoy, and I thought I would give it a chance. I have listened to the tracks and they are a good representation of Amy Macdonald's style. I like the songs and I think that they are on par with her first 6 studio albums. However, I wish they would have included her most popular songs from the albums, like "Laugh In" and "Love is a Four Letter Word." She has released several albums since her first 6, and I think it is long overdue to include some of them in this compilation. I would have liked to hear some of the songs closer to her last studio albums. I also think that more of her songs should have been included in this compilation. I think that this would have brought additional depth to the compilation and would have made it a more enjoyable experience for me. I would recommend this compilation to anyone who is a fan of Amy Macdonald.

Amazon review: I love this song. It is fun to listen to. However, I think that a few lyrics are a bit farfetched. For example, the lyrics about the moon. I know that the moon is the planet that we are orbiting around, but I don't think that it can make me feel sad. The singer is quite good, and I would give it a thumbs up.

This is my first time selling on here, and i have to say that these reviews are great.

I know this is a little late, but i have to say that i am glad that you posted these reviews. I am new to Amazon, and i am sure that there are people that would love to buy a CD for nothing, and not have to worry about the CD getting scratched, or maybe even get a scratch on it that doesn't show up until you listen to the song.

So thank you for posting these reviews, and if anyone knows of any other sites that take great photos that would like a video of the album, please let me know.

Thank you.

PS: I live in Canada.

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Valerie : it has personality, class, great performing style. oh, it is beautiful.  I realy wish that it would be her signature song, not the " I'm not going to rehab, (no, no, no,) " one.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song it was on the radio.  I was in the car in the car and came back to the house and heard this song on the radio. I did not remember the lyrics but the song has a beautiful melody and rhythm and sounds like a really good song.  I do remember the lyrics.  It is the best song on this album.  You know, because it sounds like "I'm so in love" and "I want you so much."  I love this song and I think it is really underrated.

Amazon review:  This is a very good song.  It is very easy to sing along with.  I like the chorus and the part in the middle that starts with "I love you."  I like the part in the middle where it goes from "I love you" to "more than anything in this world."  This song is very good.
