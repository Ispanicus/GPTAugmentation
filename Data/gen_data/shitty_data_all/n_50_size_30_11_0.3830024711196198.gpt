Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I'm not sure what is going on with me sometimes.  I mean, I love this album, I would never pass up anything that I consider to be a "classic" rock album.  This album is on my top albums for the 80's and 90's.  It is a great example of what we are talking about when we talk about "Classic Rock".  Maybe people don't like it as much as I do, but it's worth the time of any listener to give it a listen.

That being said, if you like this CD, then I don't know what else I can say.  This CD has a nice feel to it.  It's got a real good groove to it.  It has a real good groove to it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...

Amazon review:  When I first saw the music for this show I thought I was in the wrong theatre.  I thought I was dead.  How could it have been this bad?  I am so glad I saw it.  If you want to know what I think then listen to the album before you judge.  The music is so beautiful and so well done.  I have not heard one bad thing from this production.  I have been on the edge of my seat since the opening night.  I was there on Saturday and it was amazing.  I had not heard a note of the music till the very last.  By the time I left I was on the floor crying.  This is a beautiful show.  It is just not for everyone.  But for those who enjoy a good musical it is worth the money.

Amazon review: The music is absolutely gorgeous.  Although you must hear the lyrics, it is much more than just the words.  It is the music.  So you will hear a piece of music that no one else will hear.  You will hear it in a different way.  And you will hear it in many different ways.  It is as if you will hear a different song each time you hear it.  A song that will be on repeat in your head forever and ever.  A song that will be a song for you.

Amazon review:  I was not surprised that this show was a hit.  I had heard it would be a hit.  And it was a huge hit.  But I was very disappointed with the performances.  I saw it with my mother.  I had not heard how bad the singing was until I walked out of the theatre and saw the audience laughing at the singing.  I am sorry to say.  But this is not the musical I had always envisioned.  The music is beautiful and the performances are bad.  The show was a comedy with music.  It is not a musical.  I am sorry to say.   Just the way it was presented didn't feel like a musical.   It felt like a show.  When I have more time I will listen to the rest of the albums and see if the shows differ from the albums.

Amazon review:  I love this show.  The music is amazing.  The show is amazing and the lyrics are very well written.  I cannot believe this show is still going.  It is just not holding up.  I was in the audience on opening night.  I was standing by the screen and I just felt like I was the last person there.  The show was amazing.  The acting was great.  The choreography was great.  I was sitting in the orchestra seats.  I was sitting in the middle of the orchestra.  I watched the show from my seat.  I did not see the show from the stage.  I did not hear the show from the audience.  The show was amazing.  I would give it to anyone.  I was so happy when I walked out of the theatre that I was crying.  I have not been to a show in years that I would call "The greatest show ever".  The show is amazing and I have lived with the cast for 15 years.  I am not going to get involved in the drama of the reviews.  I will just note that the show is great.  The performances are poor.  I would not give a show to anyone not worth it.  The show is amazing.  The lyrics are great.  The music is amazing.  I love this show.  I love this show.  It is amazing.  I love this show.  The performances are great.  It is amazing.  I wish I could find the lyrics.  The show is amazing.  I love this show.  I was not surprised that this show was a hit.  I was not surprised that it is still going.  I was very disappointed with the performances.  I saw it with my mom.  I had not heard how bad the singing was until I walked away from the theatre and saw the audience laughing at the singing.  I am so sorry to say.  But this is not the show I had always envisioned.  The music is beautiful and the performances are poor.  The show was a comedy with music.  It is not musical.  I am sorry to say.  Just the way it was presented did not feel like a musical.  It felt like a show.  When I have more time I am going to listen to the rest of the albums and see if the shows differ from this one.

Amazon review: This is an awesome album but if you are looking for a rap album to listen to on the go then this is not it.  I love Eminem but the lyrics are just repetitive and not all that interesting.  My only complaint with this album is that I didn't like the song "I'm Back" one bit.  I think it's a bit of a filler.  There needs to be more songs on this album to make it more interesting.  I would have given it a 4 star rating had I been able to.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  This was the only one of the albums I purchased that I could not get past the first listen.  This album, despite the best efforts of the producer, is just plain and simply dreadful.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I heard this album on the radio for the first time a few weeks ago, and I was really struck by its unique sound.  I immediately bought a couple of the songs, and I can't stop thinking about the melody of "Dancing in the Light" and how it's hauntingly beautiful.  It's one of the few songs I like from the entire CD, and for that, I thank the producers and musicians who made the CD possible.

Amazon review: I have listened to both the original  version and the new version of this album.  The original version is  fantastic.  The new version is  disappointing.  The original version is so beautiful and uplifting.  It always make me feel happy, and this version does not.  The lyrics and music are nice, but the entire album is just a little too much to listen to.  I'm glad that there are some new songs on this album.  I hope they will get more attention soon.

I have been going back to the radio station where I heard them the first time and listening to the new album.  I have not been able to stop listening to the new songs.

Amazon review: I started listening to Ray Benson in the mid-1990's.  I had no idea he was part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I did not know he had co-written the anthem for the World Series.  I have heard "Bobby Jean" many times, but I must say I thought it was the greatest song of all time.  I was wrong.  After hearing "Bobby Jean" I went and found Ray Benson and his band.  I have not stopped listening to the new version of "Bobby Jean" since I heard it.  I am not sure what I am going to do with my life.  I feel like I have found the band that is going to save me.  I cannot get enough of their music.  I have listened to the new version of "Bobby Jean" a lot.  I cannot stop.  I love it.  I am not sure what is going to happen now.  I am not sure what I will do.  I want to know and try all the new things that this band is doing.  Thank you so much Ray Benson for letting me listen to your music.  I love you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
