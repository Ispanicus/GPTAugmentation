Amazon review: i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable.

Amazon review: This is a very good album. The songs are very well produced and have good harmonies and vocals.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

###
Amazon review: A good, solid mix of rock, funk, and soul with a big dose of '80s soulful pop. "I Think You're Wonderful" is a great song, but it's not as powerful as many of the other tunes on the album. The production is solid but not flashy and the sound has a nice "warmth" to it. (more than the average mix of the day)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't recall where I first heard this song.  One of my best childhood memories is of singing it to my parents when they had to turn the radio down for some reason.  This is a great song, and a great tune.  The lyrics are simple yet complex.  The melody is good, the harmonies are tight, and the instrumentation is solid.  I didn't really like the production much, it sounded a little too "cheap" (I think it was the A-side) with the reverb.

Amazon review: There's an interesting story behind this song.  It's the first single I ever released, and I was living in a little apartment with my older brother.  He was my first real boyfriend, and I was his first real girlfriend.  I was fifteen years old and in love.  One day, my mother came home from work and she was in an emotional state.  I was in the living room with my brother and she asked me to come to the kitchen where she had an argument with my father.  I walked into the kitchen, and she grabbed me and kissed me, and then just as quickly let go and ran upstairs to the bathroom.  I don't remember the argument at all, but I do remember that she ran upstairs to the bathroom where my father was coming out of the bedroom where he had been making love to my mother.  I ran upstairs to tell my father what happened and that he had to come and help her.  He came down to the kitchen where I was standing and he got in the middle of the argument and that's when he kissed me and gave me a big hug.  From that moment on, we've been together for forty years and still love each other.

Amazon review by:  "I don't have any complaints about the sound quality or performance of the Beethoven 9th Symphony, but I do have a few issues with the "flowing" recording.  The first is that there seems to be a 'wave' effect that occurs throughout the piece, where the sound is slightly delayed, sometimes from several seconds to well over three minutes.  This effect only happens during the first two minutes and a half of the piece.  It doesn't seem to bother anyone who isn't deaf.  The second is that there seems to be a'salt and pepper' effect at the beginning of each of the first two movements, which I can't really explain, but it seems to bother some people.  The third is that during the third movement, the sound seems to fade off abruptly.  I think this is just a defect in the recording, which probably wouldn't bother anyone who isn't deaf.  I am not bothered by any of these problems, so please don't take them personally.  I hope that this review helps you decide if you want to buy this recording or not."

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

It could have been a great album, if the singer was a good singer.  It could have been a great album, if the band wasn't just a cover band.  I am not a fan of the cover bands, but I have to admit, the band has a good sound and lyrics (which I have to say are not bad either) but the drummer is a complete dud.  The vocals are ok, but it seems as if the singer is putting them in the wrong places.  The vocals are also, as I have mentioned, just not as good as they could have been.  I think this album could have been a great album, if the singer was a good singer, the band was a good band, and the drummer was a good drummer.  However, I did enjoy the album, and I thought it was a good album.

They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: Composer is included in the file information.  This is baroque so it's going to sound well, baroque.  Of course there are going to be some you aren't 100% thrilled with, but come on. it's $5 for all of them!

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this for a couple of weeks now.  I listen to it every morning when I turn on my radio.  I was in an accident, and I didn't have a lot of time to listen to music, so I started at the beginning.  I was drawn to the title track, and the last one, all alone, something to say.  I think I will be going to the live thing at the end of the year.  I hope I can play as much as I did before I went to the hospital.  I love the sound of Skyworld.  I was hoping to hear a little more of it.  This is a very good album.  I'm sure there will be more fans after I go to the live thing.  I think I may have to buy another one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the album, but I'm not crazy about the track names.  There's some things that don't sound like songs, like the opening track.  I guess it's a way of including the vocals in the name.  I think, though, that the rest of the album is great.  I think the first track is the best.  All Alone With Something To Say is a good name.  It has a story attached to it, but not much in the way of lyrics.  I think the last two tracks are okay.  I don't think they're great.  I like Skyworld, but I think I'll be going to the live show in the next year.  I really like the first track, I think this is a good album.  I would have given it five stars if the track names didn't bother me.  I think it's a good album but it's not what I expected.  It's not going to be what I expect of the live show.  It's a good album, though.

Amazon review: I have heard this album twice.  There are many different tracks on this CD.  I don't know if it is a good or bad album.

Amazon review: I found this album in a used record store.  I was not expecting to find a lot of new music for my collection.  I just wanted a new CD to replace my CDs that have been in the same box since I first got them.  I really like the title track.  I like the first track, "All Alone".  I think it's one of the better tracks on the album.  I like the second track, "Something to Say".  I have never heard a song with a title like this, but I think the lyrics go well with the music.  The third track, "Skyworld", is a "what if" type of song - a little different but still pretty good.  I think the last track on the album is "The End", which is my least favorite.  It is more of a "let's get together again" type of song.  I wish there was some kind of "cure" on the album.  It would be great to see the band play live again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was listening to this album last night.  I am not crazy about it, but it is good.  It is not bad, and I think it has a lot of potential.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a decent album.  It's good, but not great.  But it's not the worst thing he's done.  And he's still a good singer and a great performer.  The songs are mostly ballads, which is fine by me.  But the ballads are all pretty awful and don't have much depth.

And you know, there is David Lee Roth singing a ballad in the middle of "If The Devil You Know," and another song about death and dying.  I was expecting more with this album.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This is a GREAT cd, but I have to say I am not a fan of the album cover.  Its a hard choice to make, but I have to say, the cover is not very creative.  It has nothing to do with the music, but its ugly and kinda creepy.  The song selection is, on the other hand, very good.  I mean, I like the concept of the album; it is a musical tribute to the music that made him famous.  It is a great tribute.  I really like the songs, and enjoy the album a lot.  It is a great album.  However, I don't think you can put a finger on the cover.  It's just a boring colorless, boring looking album cover.  As a tribute, I must say its very good.  I don't really care for the album cover, but I must say I like the songs.  However, the album is too short.  They could have made this into a very long album.  I could have spent more time listening to the songs.  The songs are just not as good as the album, but I still like the album a lot.  To me, it is more of a tribute.  Its a tribute to the great songs that made him a superstar.  I can go with that.  But I don't like the album cover.  I think its just a poor choice.  I like the music, but I don't like the album cover.  I think its a poor choice.  I don't like the cd cover choice.  Its not a good choice.  I think the cd is very good.  I don't think the cd is a good choice.  This is a bad cd cover.  It is bad choice to put the CD cover on the cd.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This CD is a nice addition to my collection.  However, I would suggest that this should have been advertised as a CD with more songs and less "chatter" to make it more appealing.  It is a good collection of gospel songs.  I found a few that I had not heard much about before.  They are all good songs.  The backing vocals on "Worthless" and "Fulfilled" are really well done.  I would also like to note the quality of the musicians in this recording.  I am not sure how the CD was made, however, the quality of the musicians is first rate.  I would recommend this CD to anyone interested in gospel music.

The song is very sad, but I have been working on my own song for about a week now, and I feel good about it.  I have learned a great deal from this experience and have learned more about myself since I started working on my own song.  For some people, this project is a way to be happy.  I am glad I could share this with someone.  Please think about this, and consider signing up for the mailing list.  It's a wonderful way to get more music.

Amazon review: I'm not completely sure what I'm going to do with this.  I like that this is an independent release.  It means that the band is working on new material.  I've been making music for a long time, and I'm going to be able to go back and listen to it without the other bands and try to figure out things I'm not sure of.  It's a great way to learn about making music, and I wouldn't have thought of it.

I'm glad I did because not only was she happy with the purchase, but she was excited to hear that I liked it.  She wanted to hear more.  She told me that my family and I would get to listen when I was a teenager.  So now I'm a teenager and my mom's happy I got to hear this when I was a teenager.  I can't wait to be a teenager again and listen to this album.  I cannot believe how great this album sounds.  It's just a great experience.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: It's an album for the people who love worship and praise songs but also want a good mix of rock songs.  If you like worship songs and you want rock songs, then this is a good album for you.  It has songs like "I Need You" and "I'm Alive".  The album has a few rock songs as well.  This is a good album.  I don't know what is going to become of this album, but it is a good album.  I was amazed at how well this album turned out.  I like the songs "The Savior" and "I Need you", "I'm Alive", "Praise is what I do", and "I'm Alive".

It has songs like "Heavenly Father", "I Need You", "I'm Alive", "Praise is What I Do", "Praise is What You Do", and "Praise is What I Do".  It also has a few good rock songs like "Awesome", "I Need You", "I'm Alive", "I Want to believe", "I Want to Believe", and "Praise is What I Do".  I really like the songs "I Need You", "I'm Alive", "Praise is what I Do", and "I'm Alive".  I like the songs, "I Need you", "I'm Alive", "Praise is You", and "I'm Alive".

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
