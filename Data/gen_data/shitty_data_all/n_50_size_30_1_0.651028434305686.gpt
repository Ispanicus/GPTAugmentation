Amazon review: I love this album. Clint's music has always been unique and I really enjoy his country/western music. The only thing is that I wish he had stayed in the middle of the road and not moved to the top of the charts. It has always been hard to tell what he is doing and he tends to go on too long. I understand that is his style, but it does not translate well into the mainstream. I would rather listen to his first 3 records and the one he made with Dolly Parton. It is a little bit slower, but it is still very good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: A shame, because this is one of the best albums of the year.   It's a shame that not many people seem to care about Twiztid, but that's probably just because they don't realize the true talent of this group and that they're really quite good, especially for the time.  As a matter of fact, I think they're better for the time period they were in.  I can't believe I'm talking about this with a positive sentiment on here, but I really hate how Twiztid went from being a very good group and a very good artist to being nothing good, at all.  I'm a fan of Twiztid, and I liked this album quite a bit, but the sad thing is that they've been on top of the world for a long time and now they're just not.  They just have to learn to be a little more humble, and more humble, and more humble...

Amazon review: Well, I was at a show recently, and I heard about it on the radio, and I was like "man, that's a great band". I was looking into it, and I decided to try that record.  You know, I was hoping to find something new, I mean, I loved the original, but I could have done without half of it, but I like the "new" one better.  It's so sad to find out that Twiztid just wasn't on my radar this time around.  The first half of the album is fine, the second half is just a little too much, and I just couldn't get into it.  But now that I've listened to the new album, it sounded a lot better and the last third was actually pretty good.  I'd say that you should check it out, but I think you should only do it if you're already a Twiztid fan.  It's a shame that there were such good songs on the first album that you're disappointed to find out that the last third wasn't as good as the first two.  I think this album is a great way to start off the year, and if you're into Twiztid, you should check it out.  It's a good one, and it's a great way to end the year, too.

Amazon review: There's not much to say about this album.  I'm not really a fan of rap, but this is a great rap album, and it's not just the song selection.  The rap is a little too mainstream for me, but I'm not really complaining about that, because on the whole, it's a very enjoyable listen.  The rap is very good, and I couldn't believe that it was produced by RZA, but I digress.  I'm pretty sure I like the song selection, but I didn't quite like the album, so I'm not gonna give it a positive sentiment.  I love the song "Black Jesus" and the song "Hate Me Now" is pretty good, but I just couldn't get into it.  It's just not for me, and I'm kind of a non-fan of rap.  The song "Lemonade" is one of the few songs that is really good, even though the lyrics are pretty corny.  There are a few other good songs, like "A.D.I.D.A.S.", "I Miss You" and "I'll Be There", but at the end of the day, I just didn't like the album.  I'm not really a fan of rap, and I don't know what to say about it, but it's not bad, so I'll give it a negative sentiment.

It's interesting to see how Lin Manuel Miranda writes, and his lyrics, and his melodies.  The overall message is clear and simple, and the message is important because it's dealing with a lot of issues, and it's a very important album.  The first half is just a little bit better than the second half, and the third half is just as good as the first half, and it's very well done.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review:  My daughter has been wanting to sing since she was 10 months old.  We have always tried to encourage her to sing in church and other events, which has never been successful.  This group is a breath of fresh air, and I enjoyed listening to them sing.  I like the fact that they have a lot of different styles as well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I listened to this CD while traveling for work. The CD was great.  I will definitely be purchasing more music from this group.  I have been looking for a group to sing with for a while now and I found it.  For a group that sings in different styles, this group is a great addition to my music collection.

Amazon review:  This album was put together so that the New York City Opera Chorus, which performed it for the first time last night, could hear themselves singing the songs again.  The singing throughout the CD is excellent, and the musical content, which is mostly Italian, French, English, German, and Spanish, is impressive.  The singing of the choristers is excellent, and I enjoy the variety that the singers bring to the chorus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This CD is a great addition to my CD collection.  From the opening notes of the title track, there is an excellent level of sound quality, and the singing of the singers is top notch.  I was impressed by the depth of the voices of these singers, and I enjoyed listening to them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a great CD for the singer.  I especially enjoyed the songs in French.  I purchased this CD as soon as I received it.  I will definitely be purchasing more from this group in the future.  It was a great purchase.  I am looking forward to more music from this group.  They are a great addition to my CD collection.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

This CD is one of my favorites of his.  I love the energy in the songs.   I love the emotion in the songs.   The lyrics are beautiful.   The arrangements are beautiful.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the late great rapper, Dr. Dre.  I always respected his music when he was on top and I was a fan of his lyrical prowess.  This was a great album though and I loved the guest appearances.  The only thing I did not like about the album was the song with Erykah Badu and the song with Kool G Rap.  It just seems to me that the tracks that I enjoy the least usually end up on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am getting sick and tired of seeing and hearing the mainstream rap artist.  The mainstream rap artist is the one that has been over saturated the entire time that the music industry has been in the game.  Rap artists need to find a way to stand on their own in the music industry.  With that in mind I am glad I went to this show.  For the first time I enjoyed hearing hip-hop in a more natural environment.  The only thing I don't like is that I don't think there is enough hip-hop on the CD.  The music is nice but not enough.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album.  I love the fact that they are trying to bring hip-hop back.  They are just not doing it well.  I really like the CD.  The CD has a lot of good songs.  The only thing I don't like about the CD is that there is no female artist that they can turn their attention to.  The CD only has 4 female artists.  Some songs are great and some songs are average.  If you are like me you like to hear females in hip-hop.  The CD is a great start to a new era of hip-hop.  The CD has some good songs.  I like the CD.

Amazon review: I'm a big Kool G Rap fan.  He has brought hip-hop back to where it should be.  I love the fact that he can make a lot of songs and they have come out over the years.  I love the fact that he uses the word "bitch" in every song.  I love the fact that he is a former convict and I love the fact that he is a father.  I love the fact that he is a good artist and I love the fact that he is a good father.  He has gone down the wrong path.  He uses the word bitch in every song.  He is a bad artist.  He is a bad father.  I love the fact that he is a good convict and I love the fact that he is a good father.  Even though he is a bad father he is a good rapper.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if I have ever heard a better album than the one this guy is doing.  Kool G Rap is back and he is back with another great album.  I think the only thing that he can do better is put out a CD with a single voice that could make it.  I can't wait to see what he does next.  I love the fact that he is a former convict and I think his former prison time is great.  He is a good father and I think he is a good artist.  I don't think he is a good father and he is not a good artist.  He is a bad convict and he is a bad artist.  I don't like the fact that he uses the word bitch in every song.  I think he should use an alias to do his music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Title: The Voice
Publisher: Random House

The premise of The Voice is that a record company team is asked to select two artists to compete in a blind auditions for a recording contract. The artists are not told the identities of the other artists. At the end of the process, the public is told that the two artists are in fact the same person. Each of the artists then has a public performance of the song that he or she originally submitted. The song is then released by the artist and the song goes on to be used as the theme song for the next season of the show. It is the goal of each artist to have the song on the show used in the next season.

The Voice is an American television competition show that began airing on Fox in the United States on December 1, 2003. The show has been broadcast internationally in various countries. The show is hosted by two singers, Adam Levine (formerly of the band Maroon 5) and Blake Shelton (formerly of the band The Eagles). After Levine and Shelton receive the call to audition for the show, they are given 10 minutes to prepare for the audition. The show is broadcast live, with the first two acts sent off to perform in front of the judges, Mike Darnell, Adam Lambert, and Jennifer Hudson. Judges Mike Darnell and Adam Lambert serve as coaches for the artists, with Jennifer Hudson as the mentor.

The competition has been featured in the United States on the television show The X Factor, and in various countries on The Voice in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Mexico, among others.

The Voice is an unscripted reality talent show that took place in the United States and was broadcast on Fox. The show features two contestants from each of the twelve regions of the United States competing in a live, single elimination, auditions for a recording contract with a major record label. The winner of the competition is determined by a combination of public vote and viewer vote during the live show. The winner of the competition receives a recording contract and a recording contract song and will perform in front of a live studio audience. The winner will also be crowned the winner of the season of The Voice.

The X Factor is an American television competition show. It premiered on Fox in the United States on October 4, 2001, and was created by Simon Cowell and Nigel Lythgoe. The show features an audition-based competition between singers, known as contestants. The main concept of the show is to perform a song live on television. The winner of the competition receives a recording contract. The winner of the competition is determined by public vote and viewer vote during the live show.

Sing for the Moment is an American television competition show, originally hosted by Britney Spears. The show aired on Fox for its entire first season, and later aired on TNN in the United Kingdom, ABC Family in Australia, and Nickelodeon in Canada. The show featured a six person audition that aired live in front of a studio audience, where the aspiring artist performs a song. The winner of the competition is determined by viewer votes during the live show. The winner of the competition receives a recording contract.

I have never seen The Voice nor have I ever been a fan of The X Factor nor did I watch Sing for the Moment. I was intrigued by the idea of the singers from the

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Overall Impression:

Mr. Serkin is a fine pianist. I am a classical pianist, and have been for many years. But I am often frustrated by what I hear when I listen to Mr. Serkin and other pianists. I was very happy when I ordered this CD because it not only contained Schubert's Rondo, but also the other three piano quintets. I have always enjoyed classical music. When I am in the mood for classical music, I go to the church to hear Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart. With this collection I have found not only Schubert, but also other well known composers, such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin. I have always enjoyed classical music. Now I can enjoy classical music while commuting to work. I like to listen to classical music whenever I have the chance.

Overall Impression:

Mr. Serkin is a good pianist. I enjoy classical music. I have been a classical pianist for several years. Mr. Serkin is a good pianist. I feel that I would enjoy classical music even more if I had not been a classical pianist. I enjoy classical music, but I have always been a classical pianist. Classical music is very complicated. I have never been able to understand how and why one person can write a piece of classical music that is so beautiful and interesting. Mr. Serkin brings classical music to a level where all who have not been a classical pianist can enjoy it. Classical music is very difficult to understand. I have always enjoyed classical music. Now I can enjoy classical music without having to understand how it is that one composer creates so well-written music. I have enjoyed classical music. I have always enjoyed classical music

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
