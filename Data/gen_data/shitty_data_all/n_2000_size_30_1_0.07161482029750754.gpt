Amazon review: It would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of Jenni's father Geoff and an admired of her mother, Maria. So.  Those questions are answered. As for the CD and Jenni on her own, this is a well thought out, highly listenable and original album.  It has been playing on my equipment for several years now, and wears well. Enjoy.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like to download the free songs and albums to find artists that are different within their genre.  Sister Hazel is not one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like this album by this very talented singer/songwriter who makes music in the '90s.  It's got great, soulful instrumentals that I enjoy listening to.  I do have a few issues with it but I guess that's to be expected if you have the same problems as me.  The only thing I don't like is how the album is put together.  For one thing, the tracks are all mixed down from the studio to be played at a slower pace, and then sped up for the cover.  It's like they made the album to be played at '90s speed.  No thanks.  What I do like is that it's really well produced.  I don't know if I'd like the album as a whole, but I do like what I do know of it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's a pretty good album, and I don't have high expectations.  I know that by going to the trouble of buying it, I'm going to like it.  It's got a nice sound to it and the lyrics are pretty interesting.  It's not one of my favorite albums, but it's ok.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a pretty good album, and it sounds like the bands from the 80s, but it's not 80s.  I didn't like it, but it was a good album.

Amazon review: I am not a very big fan of the band from the 1980's.  This is a little different.  It's got a little bit of everything from the 80's, and also the 70's.  I liked it, but I was a little disappointed.  It was ok.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of the band from the 80's.  I like this album.  It's a different sound from the other ones, but it's still one of my favorites.  The lyrics are also interesting, and the instrumentals are great.  I didn't like this album as much as the others, but it's still a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not as good as I would have liked.  The instrumentals aren't as good as I could have hoped, and the vocals aren't as great as I would have hoped.

###
Amazon review: It's one of my favorite albums, but I feel like there's something missing.  I think there's something missing with the instruments.  Even though I have other albums that are great, I don't think I can have a favorite this album.  The vocals are ok, but the instrumentals are good.  I don't know if I'd buy a whole album for the instrumental tracks, but it's one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Negative, but in a good way
###
Amazon review:  I really like the album, but it's not quite as good as I would have liked.  The instrumentals are good, but some other parts are lacking.  I would have liked to have heard more about the band and the concept behind this album.

Amazon review: I really don't know what to say, except, this is a good album.  I like the instrumentals, and I like the vocals.  It's a good album.  It's just not one of my favorites.

Amazon rating:  This is the second album I've bought by 'The Bangles', the first being 'This Kiss Is for You'.  I listen to 'The Bangles' when I can, but I don't listen to all the albums or albums I own.  They are all good in their own way, so this album, although not one of my favorites, is still a good purchase.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: My favorite album by the 'Bangles' is 'Sister Hazel'.  It's a different sound than the other albums by this group, but it's still a good album.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have followed Lea since she first appeared on Glee. she has a voice that so powerful. and I am happy to see her career continues to climb.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard a live performance of the Imagine Dragon's and really enjoyed the music, so I ordered the album. The album unfortunately is a huge disappointment. The mastering of this album is terrible. A number of the songs on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect. When you hear the songs live, the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance. But on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Oh man, this is a very catchy tune.  The only thing I have to say is that I don't know what was up with the backing vocals.  At first I was confused by them, but then realized they were just guitar, bass and drums, but backing vocalist was missing.  I'm not sure if I'm missing something.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the only one of the Felt releases I haven't listened to yet.  This is my first and only issue with the album.  It's an awkward song, with the backing vocals just being a guitar and bass and drums.  The song is kind of a throwback I guess, but I like it.

Amazon review: Being a band nerd, I like listening to band music.  This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.  I was selected to play in the KKPsi/TBS National Intercollegiate Band in 1993, and we performed his "A Walk in Jurassic Park".

I think it's time white people (and all musicians for that matter) start bringing actual musicians (for the generation who may not know what that is, it's people with rhythm and who pick up these funny things called instruments)  back into the recording studio. This synthesized stuff is too tacky for words. It gives me elevator and Walmart sense-memory. I don't even think this is good enough for a musak award.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

Amazon review: I don't think there is anything here that I would say is a "perfect" album.  Some of the songs have great content and some of them are bland.  However, as a whole, I would say that this is a very listenable album.  I would say it is very enjoyable to listen to, even at times where the music is not to my liking.  The only drawback I can see is the lack of diversity in the songs.  Some of the songs are good, but most of them are just plain dull.  The only good thing I can say about this album is that the songs are not very repetitive.  I would have to say that this is a very good album that I feel is worthy of a recommendation.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

You may not have known it, but the band called The Black Keys was originally a cover band called The Dirtbombs.  This is their second album, and it is very different from their first one.  It is very dark, raw, and powerful.  In a way, I think this album is more of a companion piece to the Dirtbombs' first album, which was a lot more upbeat.  I don't know if the Dirtbombs' first album is still out there, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't, and if so, then this album could be their follow up.
The album starts out with a bang, as I have mentioned.  It's one of the best songs on the album, and it really sets the mood for the rest of the album.  As soon as you hear the first few notes of the song, you know this is going to be one of the best songs on the album.  It is very interesting and very unique.  The song is very powerful, and it really makes you think about life and death.  I'd put this album up against any album by The Dirtbombs, and I think it would probably win in a close contest.
After the first song, the band moves into a softer, more poppy sound.  The song "Don't Let Love Run Your Life" is one of my favorites on the album.  It is very positive, and it makes you think of all the different ways you can love, as well as all the different things that make you different.  I like when

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.

Amazon review:.  Some of you may wish to buy this Chicago album because, foolishly like me, you want to listen to the music and songs of the guys in 'Chicago', but you get to listen to the compositions of :  1- 'Dannay Orton',  2- 'Blair Daly',  3- 'Greg Barnbill',  4- 'Dennis Matkosky',  5- 'Chas Sandford',  6- 'Jay DeMarcus',  7- 'Brett James',  8- 'George Hawkins Jr.',  9- 'Marcus Hummon',  who are not in the band.  With only 1 song (out of 12) written entirely by a band member, apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producers think so.

I have never met anyone in the band before who was not a decent person or who had not done some good.  I was very impressed.  The Fox is a good band with a good cause.  Thank You.

I remember hearing the first song on the radio and thinking to myself "I've  heard this song before".  I thought to myself, "I've  heard this song before".  I went to the concert and  I was astonished at the amount of people there.  This made me even more excited to see them  perform.  The concert was amazing, the band played  great and the crowd  was very  enthusiastic and very  attentive.  The  music was very  good and I remember thinking to myself "I can't  believe that there are so many people here".  I  remember looking around me and thinking that this was  so interesting.  There were several  people that I thought to myself, "I can't  believe that these people are here.  I'll  be here  for a long time".  I had a great time and I would like to tell you that this is a great concert.  Thank you to  whoever put this concert together.  Thank you.

Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country.

Amazon review: This album just didn't do it for me. I got it when it came out, because I have all their CD's and love them to death. It's too girly and poppy for me, high-pitched. The lyrics are not all that clear, and don't mesh well together to mean one thing. Most of all, the melodies of the songs are hard to listen to. You know how some songs are just. difficult for the ear to enjoy? These songs are fine most of the time. but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody (or the singing) is difficult to listen to.

Amazon review: I love this album! I first saw her play with the TEMPLE of FRANK SINATRA in LA. She had performed a song I had never heard before, 'Love Is Here'. I had always wanted to hear this song and had always been waiting for a chance to see and/or hear her play the song. I was soo ecstatic when I saw her perform this song with Frank Sinatra in LA. I was hoping for a DVD of the concert when it came out, but I found out a little too late that it wasn't coming out. I had to purchase the CD and am now a huge fan of her. I love her music and I hope that the rest of her career will be as amazing as her debut album.

Amazon review: Given guitarist Emil Perry Thielhelm was still a member of the band (the only original holdover at this point), I guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves as The Blues Magoos.  That said, like the predecessor set (1969's "Never Going Back To Georgia"), anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced numbers was going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970's "Gulf Coast Bound" on their turntable.  Working with original Blues Magoos producer Bob Wyld, these six tracks featured most of the line up found on the first ABC album.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

Amazon review: It's a very fun song that encourages you to keep your head up and enjoy life. You'll turn out fine. :)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I understand this song is supposed to be all political and deep and whatnot, but her voice and the sound of this song altogether makes me want to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that I never have to listen to one second of this song ever again for as long as I live.  I'm very diverse in my music tastes but I HATE this song, I really think this is the worst song ever to be released in the history of time.

Amazon review: This is NOT a piece of music.  It is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument.  Unless you want to tune your musical instrument, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  All this is is a single tone, DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: How is this even called.  I'm at a loss. I thought this was an album of a band called The Raveonettes, but "In & Out of Control" is the name of a video game for the Wii. I can't even begin to understand what it is that this band thinks they are doing. I have no idea what the title means but at least they aren't making fun of themselves. Give them a break.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I could care less.  I am sure that the only reason this is on this compilation is because it is so darned short. I feel sorry for the poor, poor kids that have to listen to this crap.  It's like listening to some drunk kid yell at his mom for not fixing his hair while he is watching the game.  I mean, what the hell is this?  If this is the best they can do, I will gladly listen to whatever they put out next.  I love a good bad ass.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I know this band.  I have always been a fan of The Raveonettes.  I can't stand that they are so stupid and pretentious.  I am not a huge Phish fan, but I will admit that I am a huge fan of The Raveonettes.  It is sad that they are in a band that will probably not be heard for a long time, but I am glad that they are still relevant.  This is a very bad song by a bad band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I was not a huge fan of this album.  I always thought that the Raveonettes were just a cover band.  However, I recently added their album to my CD collection and was surprised at how good of an album it was.  This album is good, but it is not the best.  It is not as good as their earlier albums.  It is definitely not worth the full price of the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I purchased this song along with 4 other songs and all but this one completed the download.  I tried to cancel this song order, but could not.  Therefore I paid for this song that did not download.  No way to try a second time without paying for the song again and taking the chance it won't download again. Oh well.

Amazon review: Whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual. Not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying, she actually sounds like she's trying. Id hate to hear what she sounds like on an off day.  I think this music was meant for prisoners of war that are meant to go through psychological torture. Please, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM OR ANYTHING ELSE BY THIS ARTIST. I guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't get all the hate toward this song.  It's beautiful. It's the best thing I've ever heard. The only thing I have to say is, if you don't like it - then don't buy it.  Personally, I am looking forward to listening to this in the car or in the shower or at work, etc.  I can't hear what's wrong with it, so I'm hoping it gets its due in the end.  I'm not a big fan of the more pop-friendly songs, but I think this one is great. I would love a full album of this type of music.

Amazon review: I don�t know much about these guys, other than they are a Canadian band that has a female singer who has a very similar voice to the one on "Gravity" (I believe).  She's got a very similar voice to the one on "Gravity".  I would have known that if I had seen the album cover (which I didn't), because the album cover has a picture of her.  I will say that the album cover is a little misleading, but it's not a bad album.  It's good enough to be listened to, but not a great album.

Amazon review: This song is the first track on a CD that was released in 2002.  It was released in the UK as "Goodbye My Love".  It's about a man who is about to leave his wife and decides to make her breakfast for her.  At first, she is mad and can't believe he is leaving her breakfast for her.  He does it a second time, and then he does it a third time.  The problem is that the woman gets a little more mad each time, but she realizes that it is her duty to feed her man every morning.  This song is great.  The only problem I have with it is that it's one of those songs where you can tell at the end of the song that the singer is going to stop.  The singer says over the chorus, "I don't like this anymore... I don't like this anymore... I don't like this anymore..."  That's a good thing.  At the end of the song, the singer says, "I don't like this anymore... I don't like this..."  It's a good way to end a song.  I don't like the way this is done, but it's a good song.

Amazon review: This is a song I have heard on TV and on radio a lot, and I really want to buy it.  I have listened to it a few times and I like it.  I am not familiar with the artist, but I know the song is about how a person starts a relationship.  The song is about a young man and a young woman, and their relationship takes off right from the start.  The first time they meet, he is with his friends and she goes into the bathroom and he follows too.  They go to a party and she tries to kiss him and he says no.  The next time they meet, he goes to a party with his friends and she goes into the bathroom and he follows.  They go to a party and she tries to kiss him again and he says no.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: THIS IS HIS WORSE ALBUM EVERY. THE LYRICS SUCKS AND HIS BEATS SUCKS. HE CLAIM TO BE THE BEST BUT HE IS NOT. THE WORSE SONGS ARE THEEE FORTHS OF THE DISK. HE SHOULD HAVE TOOK TIME AND DUD THIS DISK RIGHT
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had the original CD for about a month when I was sick so I could not listen to it. So I was very excited to get this. I listened to the first few songs and they were okay. I even liked the song "Heaven is a Place on Earth" but I have to confess I did not like "What's the Use" as much as I did the previous songs. I really liked "If I Had You" and the lyrics are so beautiful to me. I really like songs that have a positive theme like this one. The overall quality isn't great but it is good. I think it will be hard to take it any other way. The music is good and the lyrics are wonderful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this type of music. Very sentimental yet a little more adult. I like that at the end of the song they start singing "and who knows what tomorrow will bring." I would love to hear this guy sing my songs. I think this is his worst recording. Not only do the lyrics suck, but the song sucks too. I am not going to buy another album by him because I don't think I will ever buy one again. The song titles are horrible, it sounds like a demo and I don't want to listen to another demo. This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this CD was a good one, but I did not like it as much as the previous CDs. I do think it was a lot of the best of the songs were repeated and that is not a good thing. The songs do not have a lot of variety, and most of the songs are the same. I like the first two songs on this CD much better than the rest of the CD, but I think the rest of the CD was a little boring for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good CD, except for the song "When I'm Gone" which I do not like. The only two good songs are the two that follow, "There's a Lull" and "What's the Use" which is very nice. I think his voice is good, and he does make some nice music. I have the standard CD, and I think I will listen to this one first. I wish he would do a lot more of these songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the worst CD I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. I believe the only good song on the CD is the song "Heaven is a Place on Earth" and the worst song is "What's the Use" which is repetitive to the point where it is annoying. I do not understand why the CD is called "Billy Squier" because I do not think that he is the Billy Squier that wrote any of the songs on the CD. He should be ashamed of himself for making a CD that is so terrible. If he has any shame he should make another CD, maybe in a different style. You know he can write good tunes and he can sing them but he doesn't do it well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I received the CD on a sale, so I have to admit I am a bit biased. I have to say, however, that I did like many of the songs on the CD. I thought "What's the Use" was very nice, that song just did not do it for me, but I enjoyed the other songs. I have to say I think the CD is very, very good. I actually thought it was better than the CD I had heard before. It is very good. I think he is a very talented man.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like this CD a lot. It is nice to hear some songs by a great artist. The only song that I do not like on this album is "There's a Lull". It is also a bit boring. "Heaven is a Place on Earth" is nice, very nice. The only song that I did not like was "What's the Use". I'm not a big fan of singing, so I didn't like this song that much. I can get into most of the songs, but this one is not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is great. I liked the songs "Heaven is a Place on Earth" and "There's a Lull". I would have liked to have heard more songs on this CD, but I am glad I did. I love Billy Squier and would like to hear more from him. I would recommend this CD to people who like nice country and western style songs. Billy Squier is a great artist.

Amazon review: Not that bad of a tribute CD, but as for myself, I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp. 'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.
