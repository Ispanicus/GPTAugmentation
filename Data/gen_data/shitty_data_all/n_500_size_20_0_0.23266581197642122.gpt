Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I've always had a big problem with Tech N9ne, there's just so much music that they release. I like Tech's songs, but I don't like them so much.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

I don't know what to say. It is the worst album of the past five years.  The music is mediocre at best, and the quality of music is poor.  The music is forgettable.  I am a fan of the last three albums, and this is a disappointing release.  It will not be on my "favorites" list.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

A:

In an attempt to be helpful, I've looked at the songs, and indeed, this is an interesting choice that's a little off. 
The first song, "When A Child Is Born" is a lovely duet between "little Bob" and "Tiny Tim" in which Tim's voice is used well. 
The second is a duet I don't know from the name (and I don't know that it's in the original), "Baby, Hold On", in which both the child and the father each make several contributions. The mother, on the other hand, is largely silent.
It also has a lovely refrain, "Oh, God, It's Christmas" from the same song, sung by the little boy, which seems to be a pretty simple "Oh, God, it's Christmas" melody. 
It's a bit of a shame that it has no accompanying music.
The third song is an instrumental, "Froggy Went A Walkin'", which also has a lovely chorus:

"Froggy went a walkin'
    Through the night,
The lights were shinin' on the trees,
    The wind was blowin' cold."

 
The fourth, "Baby, Let Me Call You Sweetheart" is more in the style of "Little Saint Nick" that's quite an old song, and it's a nice little Christmas song. 
The fifth, "It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year", is a nice little ballad, and a bit like "The Twelve Days of Christmas". 
The sixth is a bit like "Joy To The World", and I wouldn't have thought it was in the original, but I thought it was very nice. 
The seventh is a lovely little ditty, "O Tannenbaum", and I don't know from the name, but I like it. 
The eighth is a lovely little song, "Somewhere I'll Be Christmas", with a lovely melody, and a lovely chorus:

"Somewhere I'll be Christmas
    With the sun in the sky.
I'll be Christmas
    With the sun in the sky.

  "I'll be Christmas
    With the sun in the sky."

The ninth is a traditional Christmas carol, "O Little Town Of Bethlehem", and I like it. 
The tenth is a traditional carol, "Silent Night", and I don't know from the name, but it's nice. 
And the eleventh is a traditional Christmas carol, "Carol Of The Bells". 
The twelfth is a

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count).

###
Amazon review: I'm not sure whether or not this is the best album of the 90's, but it's definitely one of the most enjoyable albums. It is an amalgamation of every song on the album and some others thrown in to balance the vocals. In other words, this is a musical "junkie" who has taken everything he's heard and used it to create a masterpiece. If the other members of the band had joined him and he had been a bit more creative, this might have been a real classic. If they would have been replaced by a few different "junkies" and a few different "musicians," this might have been a real masterpiece.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of "Rikki Don't Lose That Number". I've never heard the new album, so I can't tell you anything about it except that it's great.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing.

Amazon review: Love this song. Start my day out with it.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: Love the song. Hate the download process through Amazon. I do not want your player Amazon. You made the normal download link to small, like fine print. took me too long to figure out. made me grouchy.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of his when he was still playing the venues that he had in my hometown of New York City, but I have never had the chance to meet him. My son, however, is obsessed with the song.  I don't think that Rod ever realized how much this song meant to him until he was at our wedding with his daughter wearing the same dress as he did.  My wife is the only person on earth who knows my son and he is the only person who knows me.  She has been his rock since he was too young to speak.  My son will not be there on our special day, but he will listen to the song for as long as he wishes, and when he hears the song from our wedding, there will be no doubt in his mind that he is listening to his hero singing to his daughter.  I wish I could tell him how much I loved the song.  I wish I could tell him how much it meant to me.  He will be there. He will be in the audience. He will be the one who will sing the words.  He will be the one who will be truly moved by the song.

Amazon review: I heard this song on a radio when I was a kid.  Somehow, I think I was the only person in my house who knew the words to this song.  Somehow, the words to this song were more powerful to me than the words to any other song.  I can't explain it.  I wish I could.  The words to this song have always been in my heart and soul.  I didn't know it then, but this song is the reason that I am the man that I am today.  I wish I could tell my kids the story about why I am the way I am, but I cannot.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest songs of all time, and it inspired many other artists.  It is a song that is not only about a relationship, but a love that transcends everything and anything.  It's about a love that will last forever.  It's about a love that lasts forever.  It's about a love that will last forever.  It doesn't matter how long you've been out of love, this song will always be there for you.  That's why I love this song so much, and that's why I believe that this song will always be there for me, and will always be there for every person who ever comes to know me.  This is the song that I will always carry with me as I go through life.  I will always remember this song, and I will always be singing this song, and you'll always hear me.  I will always be singing this song.  You'll always hear me.  When you hear this song, you will always know that I'm with you.  This is the song that I will always carry with me as my heart beats.  This is what makes me me.  This is the song that I will always sing with my heart.  Just as Rod Stewart did it, I will do it for you.  I will sing this song with my heart.  This is the song that it all started for me.  This is the song that taught me how much I want to be a part of your life.  When I was a kid, this song was the reason that I wanted to be a singer.  This song inspired me.  This song will always be an inspiration to me, and I will always be singing this song.

Amazon review: I grew up listening to Rod Stewart.  At that time, it was hard for me to believe that he would actually continue to sing after his career had ended.  When I was a kid, I thought that Rod would be a singer forever.  When I grew up, I was a man and I realized that Rod Stewart was not a singer forever.  Rod got up there and sang a song that was about love and the things that you cherish.  When Rod got up there and sang this song, I realized that the things I treasured were not to stay, but they could be changed, and that's what is so wonderful about it.  When Rod got up there and sang this song, it was the song of my youth and an inspiration to me.  It was a song that was made for me and that I treasured.  When Rod got up there and sang this song, it was a song that made me realize that I wanted to be someone that I was not.  When Rod got up there and sang this song, it was something that made me question everything.  It was a song that made me wonder about life, and about myself, and about myself,

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed.  I had purchased this album for a friend.  I have heard so many great reviews for this album and decided to purchase it.  I was hoping that this would be a quality effort.  I am really disappointed.  It is not.  The sound was good but the music is not.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a bad buy. The instrumentals are great and I have enjoyed listening to them.  I think this is a very good CD.  I do have a couple of problems.  First, I think the CD label was very difficult to read.  Second, when you listen to an album for first time, you may want to turn the CD player on the lowest volume to get the best sound, and not have it play too loudly.  This can make the music sound tinny and sometimes you will not hear the full sound.  This does not happen with other CD players.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes instrumental music.

Amazon review: In my opinion, this album contains some of the best saxophone solos in all of jazz.  I am not a jazz fan, but I have been listening to this CD for years and I still like it.
