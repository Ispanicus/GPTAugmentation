Amazon review: The best songs of the album were "I'll Be Back". "The Man I'd Really Like to See" "I Really Don't Want to Go" "I'll Be Back".  "The Man I'd Really Like to See" was a fantastic song and really shows the group at their best.  "I Really Don't Want To Go" was good as well.  "I'll Be Back" is also a good song and would be a good song on a debut album. "I'd Like To Be With You" is a good old one.  I'm glad I bought it. I will be happy to never hear their music again.

I like the album BRMC.  I am not a fan of The Four Tops.  I think they are boring.  I did like "I'll Be Back" and "I Really Don't Want to Go".  I think the album is very good.  I am glad I bought it.  I will be very happy to never hear their music again.  I hope they do not get a chance to do more albums.  I am not much of a fan of the sound of their music anyway.  I am glad I bought the BRMC album.  I will be happy to never hear their music again.  I hope you buy the album.  I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for listening and good luck to you.  Have a nice day.

Amazon review: Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders. A complete and utter waste of  money and time. This depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence, but will certainly line the pockets of Daniel Goleman.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

Amazon review:  I've listened to this CD three times, and I can't stop listening to it.  I think I've found the perfect album to take me away in a way that will give me a long-lasting, good-feeling feeling.  It's simply put, "Unforgettable," and I haven't even mentioned that it's incredible!  Johnny Cash has come a long way from country music, but he's still got some great songs.  "I Walk the Line," "Ring of Fire," "Big River," "The Man Comes Around," "Ring of Fire and Other Favorites."  These songs are perfect examples of the way he can sing and tell a story.  They're just great songs and amazing.  I feel like I'm always listening to him, and I really enjoy listening to him.  He's a great musician of a musician.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

I would recommend this to someone else.  There's just something about country music, but this is a sad state of affairs.  The music is good, but the sound is just not what I'm used to.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  I am not an expert on country music, but I am an expert on country music from the 1960s.  This is not the way I would like to hear country music.  It's just not the way I'm used to.  It's a shame.  I hope they find a way to get more popular albums like this out there.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Also, purchase the one that is "in the style of Glee" so that the purchase goes to a good cause.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: This is another song that should have been turned into a Broadway musical.  I'm not a fan of the song.  This is a song that is not meant for the stage.  It is the perfect song to be played in a bar, or at a party, but it's not the right song for the stage.  It's too emotional, it's too personal.  It's not a musical or an opera.  It's not a dramatic show piece.  It's just a song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is the best I've heard for a long time!  The video is just as good as the song.  I was a little nervous when I watched it, because I thought I would be singing very high and that the microphone would pick up my voice, but it was perfect!

Amazon review: While I'm not a huge fan of this song, I am a fan of the singer, and his voice is quite beautiful.  There are a couple of annoying sections in the song where the singer rambles and repeats himself.  This is the first time I've heard a song where the singer repeats himself with such frequency.  He's a great singer, and I'm glad he decided to record the song.

Amazon review: MC Flepp (Roman Flepp) from Liricas Analas raps in Romansh (Sursilvan?) and Graubnden Swiss-German. I am not a Romansh speaker. I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

Amazon review: A masterpiece. I am a diehard Lirica Analas fan. Not just that, but I am a diehard fan of MC Flepp and I have a great respect for his work. His music is really beautiful, very original and has such a deep bass that you feel like you are swimming in the music. His voice is so powerful and resonates so much with every note. The beats are perfect, he takes time and puts in the effort to make every beat really nice and makes it sound like it would be easy to make a beat with just a bass and a few pads. His lyrics are just amazing and you can feel the pain in his heart that he puts in to them. And by the way, what kind of name is MC Flepp anyway? It sounds like a weird name. The lyrics are great and he is a great artist.

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

Amazon review: I bought this last year with the intent of buying a CD by the singer,  Billie Holiday. I have been a fan of her music his records, his performances, and his personal life the last 40 years. I bought the CD I had been looking for. I was thinking of not buying the CD because I did not like the songs by Billie Holiday.  However, I listened to it again and realized that it is a very good recording of the song. I was happy that I could purchase a CD by someone else who was a friend to me. I think that this CD will be a gift to my daughter, an anniversary gift. She loves Billie Holiday music.

Amazon review: This is a good collection of Billie Holiday songs from a collection of people who know her personally. The original recordings are very nice. I like the fact that they were all in one CD. I especially like the version of "Strange Fruit." I have not heard the rest of the CD but other than that, I do not think it is bad. The vocals are good. The music is good. I think it is a nice collection of songs. I also like the cover art.

Amazon review: I would recommend the Billie Holiday collection to anyone who likes her music. I really enjoyed it. It is about the only kind of music that I like. She is an amazing singer and musician. She has been called a great singer and a great musician. I do not listen to much radio music. I do listen to the CD, but I do not listen to the radio. Although I know that many songs were on the radio before she sang them, I do not like listening to them. I do not care that they are not on the radio. I do not care that she sang them. I only like to hear the real thing. I do not think you have to have a car to listen to a CD player. I can listen to CDs while I am driving to work. I do not have a CD player that is built into my car. I just like listening to CDs. I can stop at the store to pick up a CD and I can listen to it in the car on the way home.

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.

I don't listen to country music that much so I have not heard any country songs from this album. It just seems like a bunch of boring, meaningless lyrics. I also heard this album on the radio and I heard it was good so I picked it up. Now my wife and I can't even listen to this album because we are so disgusted by it. I don't know what is worse.

Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment.

I have several of each on my piano, and I am going to take a stab at putting them on my CD player as soon as we can locate a stereo to put them on.  The music is beautiful, and the arrangements are unique and very unique.  I love the way the arrangements are put together.  I've never heard anything like this in my life.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.

Last week, we got to see the new 'Glee' musical on Broadway and I'm happy to report that not only did I love it, I also loved the show. I can't say that I didn't like the book, but I didn't dislike the show and I loved it. I didn't sleep well the night before and the next day I was too excited to sleep. I was glued to the television set for almost all of the evening. I am a huge football and basketball fan, so this show was new and interesting to me. The musical is about two high school glee club members who meet at a football game and decide to become a glee club. I have always been a fan of high school glee club, so this show was a new and interesting concept to me. It was amazing to see all of the amazing talent that was on display. The musical is fast paced, exciting and fun. The music is fantastic and the direction superb. The performances were excellent. It is about two high school glee club members who decide to become a glee club. They have to change their name to make it sound cool, change their stage act to make it seem cool, and change their sound to make it seem cool. I am a huge fan of high school high school glee club and have always been a fan of the show, so this show was new and interesting to me.

The show opens with the beginning of the school year at Greendale College and the beginning of the two glee club members' experiences. We meet the glee group members, their glee club moms, their glee club dads and their high school friends. I was surprised to see how many high school friends they had. They all seemed to be in their 20's or early 30's. I don't know if they are still in high school or not, but they were all very cute and very pretty. The show opens with the beginning of the school year at Greendale College and their experiences. I was surprised to see how many high school friends they had. The show opens with the beginning of the school year at Greendale and their experiences.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: When I first got this CD, I had no idea how much I would love it.  I had not heard the music that was on this CD before and I was surprised at how much I liked it.  I was not sure if I would like it or even give it to my spouse for her ipod, but I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway.  Now I have been listening to this CD on an ipod, and I love it.  I am not sure if I would purchase the CD album again, because the songs were played before each other (and sometimes the songs played on the same CD are somewhat different) and I have gotten used to them.  But for the price, I don't see why I would not buy this again.  I would recommend this to fans of the Big Day Out musicals.

Amazon review: With a very soothing voice I thought I would drift off immediately to sleep. You are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace. When her voice leaves you assumably asleep for 20 minutes you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that  sounds more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire. The sound of the wind is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

Amazon review: The book Think & Grow Rich is a must own. It is book to be read multiple times. That being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone. He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: This is a great CD! I bought it in 2000. I didn't think it was any good, though I guess it is because I didn't realize how good it was. I didn't listen to it much until 2003 when I re-did my CD player and then played it a lot.  I've also listened to a lot of it while driving and it sounds great on the stereo system.  It has some really great music in it.  I would have given it 5 stars except I also have a CD full of classic country songs of which I rarely listen to other than when I'm doing research.  I don't think these are any better.  I've just listened to them so many times that my ears have memorized the songs.  I know they weren't the best, but there are some good ones.

Amazon review: This is a really good collection of CD I bought back in the early 90s.  It took me a few listens to get into this CD and decide what I like and what I don't.  The songs aren't very good but they are really good.  I don't like the production of the music, but that's just me.  It's been a few years since I've listened to this CD, but I know I'll like it again when I hear it again.  I think it could make a great cd for the car, or for any place that doesn't have a stereo.  The only negative thing about this cd is that I was surprised that the CD wasn't in stereo.  I think it would have been great.  It would be a good addition for the CD collection.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the 50 Cent album for the last few years, mostly because of his rhymes and his ability to be able to rap while playing an instrument. I was very excited to hear this collection and I am glad that I did. Not only do these songs sound great, but the flow of the song makes them all sound like they are one continuous song. I found the most interesting track to be "Jumping Over", because it was the only song of the album that sounded like a rap song, but it was also the only song that I didn't enjoy at all. I found the other songs to be very enjoyable and I enjoyed listening to them, but I didn't really like most of the songs on this album. I would have liked to have gotten more songs from the album. I found this collection more enjoyable to listen to than the "Underground" collection that I bought earlier in the year.

Amazon review: It's been a while since i've really listened to Tegan and Sara, but when in heard "I Couldn't Be Your Friend" I immediately had to buy the album.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: I have to admit that I know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre, but in my opinion this is the best one since Britney Spears' cover of Madonna's cover of Marilyn Monroe covering "Happy Birthday" for JFK.
