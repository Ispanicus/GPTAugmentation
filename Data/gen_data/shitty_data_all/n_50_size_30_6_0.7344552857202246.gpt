Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

After about ten minutes, I decided to try deleting it from my hard drive. It didn't get deleted. I opened iTunes and went to the music folder and clicked "Remove from library", the song was still there. I decided to delete it from my hard drive. I went to the Music folder and clicked "Delete from hard drive", and it was still there. I decided to close iTunes. I went to the music folder and clicked "Cancel", the song was still there. It took me an hour of trying to delete the song from my hard drive. I finally decided to just let it go, because I didn't have the time to hunt it down, and found it to be a great song.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Good song. I was very surprised at how well this song did with me. I was kind of hesitant about this because I was under the impression that it was going to be a bad song.

It's just a song about a girl who is having a hard time in life and is having a hard time trying to get over him. It's just a really good song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

How does it take over the whole album? Is it a concept album?

This is a great album, I just wish that it was a little bit more coherent. I am not sure what it is trying to say, but I get the feeling that it is trying to be more of a concept album. I didn't like the first one, but the second one is great. I am really enjoying it so far.

There are a few songs that could be considered great on this album. "All Together Now" and "Just a Little Love" are two of my personal favourites.

What I am saying is that this is a very good album, but it is very, very uneven. I am surprised that I liked the first two albums so much, but now I am really getting into it. I just wish that they had more songs on here.

I think that when they do a concept album, or at least one with a good concept, it is just the first one that people buy that is the one that becomes something special.

I am really enjoying it so far.

There are a few songs on here that could be considered great, but many of them are just average. I have noticed from listening to this album that the lyrics are very repetitive. The songs that are great are the ones where the lyrics are original and interesting.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a very enjoyable song.  The narrator tells of the love of God that we have for our Savior Jesus.  The chorus is very strong.  The arrangement is quite nice and well written, although not very complex.  I would recommend checking out The New King James Version of the Bible.    The music and lyrics fit exactly with the story of the book.  The book is not a very long book, (about 300 pages) but it contains a lot of very important and important things that need to be remembered.   I recommend this CD to anyone that wants to hear great music and see God's love in action.   I give this 5 out of 5 stars.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

So you have a few songs to choose from in the "Real Slim Shady" album?  Well,  here's a great song that I think you'll like.  The song is called "Slim Shady (Live)" and it was recorded at the  legendary  "Vulgar  Propaganda" festival in Santa Barbara, California.

If you like Eminem, you'll like this song.  The song's got a very unique and interesting sound.  The sax player brings a very unique  part to the song, so if you're in the mood for that then you'll like this.

If you like Eminem, you'll like this song.

The album has been released as a double CD by the publisher, but has only been available as one CD. However, it is now available on Amazon (and other online retailers) as a single CD.

The album was released on February 18, 2009, and immediately received favourable reviews from many sources, including Classical and Jazz critic, Peter Marsh, who concluded with "Dallas Holm continues to be an artist whose music is very hard to resist."

This album also received positive reviews from music critics. The "MusicWeb" said, "Dallas Holm's latest album 'Fantasy' is a true classic and the album is certainly worth the $19.99 price tag."

The album also received favourable reviews from "Guitar Player" magazine, who said, "Dallas Holm's latest album is a true classic in the classical world and one of the best albums of the year. It's worth every penny, and I think my friends and family will agree."

The album also received favourable reviews from "Guitarist" magazine, who said, "Holm's 'Fantasy' is one of 2009's most memorable albums."

The album was also well received by Classical Music Magazine, who said "In a few short months, Holm has become the world's most important classical musician. His album features some of the world's best musicians, including the Austrian violinist Josef Gingold, the New Zealand pianist Peter van der Merwe, and the English organist John Ogdon. He's also one of the best instrumentalists I've ever known, and this album is a real work of art."

AllMusic reviewer, Matt Collar, said "Holm has done it again. He doesn't just write music that sounds good on a single instrument, he writes music that sounds good on three or four instruments, and this album, 'Fantasy', is no exception."

The album received favourable reviews from many other music critics, including "The NME" who wrote "Dallas Holm, the British composer of 'The Last of England,' 'The Man Who Fell to Earth,' and 'The Man Who Can't
