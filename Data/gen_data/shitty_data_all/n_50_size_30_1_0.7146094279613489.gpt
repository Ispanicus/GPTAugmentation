Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

It has everything that is great about this genre.  This is just a really great release of music for all genres.  I do have to say that the lyrics to "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden" are really really bad and just not believable at all.  The song itself is a great song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I didn't expect to like the songs on this CD as much as I did; I thought it was kind of weak, but when I listened to it, I realized how much I like the music.  I've never heard anything like it before.  Robert Johnson is one of the best singers the blues has ever had.  He sings about people's hopes and dreams, and how they feel when they go through life.  I think I'll add some of his albums to my CD collection, and check out more from Robert Johnson.  I can already tell I'll be listening to his CDs for a long time.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Okay, I like this CD. I like the fact that it was recorded on an old recorder and then mixed with a cassette recorder, but the song is not as good as the demo that I first heard.  I think that this has the potential to be a hit, but the instrumentals are a little too much for the singer.  I really liked the song "You Can Never Say Goodbye."  Now I want to hear the rest of the songs on the CD.  I can't wait for the next CD.  It's good. I'm glad that I put this album on the Christmas gift list. It's one of the few CDs that I have bought for myself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like this album as much as I did before.  The first songs are cute, but as the album progresses the songs get a little cheesy and are not really my cup of tea...but I will probably listen to this once more.  I really liked the song "Here's to Life."  I think this is the CD I will be going back and listening to.  I just wish I had bought the CD when it was first listed on Amazon.  I would have been happy.  It's good.  I'm glad I bought it.  It's one of the few CDs that I bought for myself.

Amazon review of the CD: I just got the CD and I like it as much as the demo I had before. I like the fact that it was recorded on an old recorder and mixed with a cassette recorder. Now that I have the CD, I am really curious about the songs on this CD. I really like "You Can Never Say Goodbye" and "Here's to Life." I don't like the fact that this CD is not a full length album. It's more of a demo. It's an hour and forty-five minutes. I do not think this is the CD for me right now...but I will probably check this CD out again later.  The CD has great instrumentals like the song "You Can Never Say Goodbye."  I do not like the song "Here's to Life."  I feel like the instrumentals are not as good as the demo I had before when I first heard the song.  I would recommend this CD to people who enjoy music and have a great appreciation for music in general...but I am not sure if it is the CD for me right now.  The CD is good. I really liked the song "You Can Never Say Goodbye."  I think this is the CD I will be going back and playing around with. I just wish I had bought the CD when it was first listed on the Amazon Marketplace. I would have been happy. It's good. I'm glad I bought it. It's one of the few CDs that I bought for myself.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

But I was not alone.
In the mirror,
I saw only my reflection.
I am a man.

There was blood on my hands.
But blood on my hands.

There was blood on my hands.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: The first thing I noticed about this CD was that it was written by a woman.  The second thing was that it was written by two woman.  The third thing is that the music is very, very repetitive.  The fourth thing is the fact that the lyrics are often incoherent.  The other thing was that it seemed like the songs came from an entirely different woman's point of view.  The best way to describe it is to imagine that the songs were written by two women meeting for the first time and being forced to sit down together and listen to each other's point of view.  The songs make a good argument for the existence of God.  The worst part is that the songs will never be played by any man because the women can't stand to listen to any man sing them.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

###
Amazon review: I'm not surprised that some people don't like this CD.  This CD is just that -- a CD.  There is nothing special about it.  The songs are not special or memorable to me.  I've listened to the song "S.O.S."  The only time I've heard the song was when I was in high school.  The rest of the songs are just not in the same genre as "S.O.S."  I'd like to hear some of the more popular rap songs on this CD, like "R. Kelly's Bigger and Deeper" or "Sexy Lady."  I haven't heard either of those songs in forever.  What I like about this CD is that I can listen to it over and over and over again.  The whole album is just a bunch of generic songs.  I am going to get this album and give it to my friend as a present.

Amazon review: I don't care that this CD is a remix of the original.  The original is much better.  I think that this album is a good cd.  The only cd I've gotten for the money is  Pink Floyd,  but even then, I prefer the original Pink Floyd CD.  I got this cd because I had bought the CD of Pink Floyd's  The Wall, and I thought I'd pick up the  Pink Floyd.  I like the songs from  Pink Floyd.  I'll have to find the original Pink Floyd CD.  All the songs are great.  I'm not sure what made me go with the remix.  The cd of  Pink Floyd is very good.  I have listened to it over and over and over again.  It is very entertaining.  The only thing that I don't like about this cd is that the songs are very repetitive.  I think the song "S.O.S." is good because it is not just another song and it isn't very repetitive.  The CD was worth the money because it's not just another CD and it's a good cd.  The cd is all in all, a good cd.  The cd is all in all, a good CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

About The Author

I'm a teacher and musician. I enjoy both as much as you do! Music is my passion, but I'm also a teacher, and I believe that music should be used for more than just music. It can be a learning tool, an exercise, and a way to express yourself. I started this blog to show people how to use the internet to find new music. I hope you enjoy it.
The following is a list of my favorite songs. To learn more about them, click the links to the songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: I've listened to this since I first discovered her.  She is really good.  But I don't like her new stuff. I'm glad I bought the first one so I could be exposed to her music.  That's the key to her success.  I bought it just to get into her music.  I don't like it. It doesn't make me want to buy her other stuff.  I think she's just looking for attention.  I don't want to sound negative but to be honest. I'm not a fan.  I hope I'm wrong.

Amazon review: I have been a fan since I first heard her.  I think Meghan is a very gifted songwriter.  She is trying to get more people to listen to her music which is good.  It's just that I will never buy her music.  I feel like she's trying to get herself more recognition so she can sell more songs.  I feel her music is just for herself and not for anyone else.  I've tried to help her on her new album as I was excited about it.  I've sent her a couple of emails with some suggestions but I haven't heard back from her.  I just don't like her new stuff so I'm going to stop writing her stuff.  In one of her songs she says she just wants people to know her music.  That's it.  I don't want to sound negative but it's just that I don't like it. I hope she decides to listen to her fans since she's doing such a great job.

This is my first post. I'm new here.
I've been a fan of Meghan Trainor for a while.  I've listened to her since my first exposure to her.  I've been listening to her music since my first exposure to her.  I can't imagine living my life without my CD player.

We were at a party at my house when Meghan walked in. She walked towards our group of friends and talked to all of them. I was watching her closely. She was nice and friendly but she acted like she didn't care. I told her I liked her and she smiled and said she liked me too. We walked back to our friends and she talked to them and left.

Since that moment I've been a huge fan.  I've been listening to her since the first release of "Your Body is a Wonderland".  I liked the first release on her website.  Then I decided to buy the first disc in her "Wildest Dreams" series.  I loved the first release.  I was very happy for the new CD.  I was excited to find out what the CD was about.  I really wasn't looking forward to it.  I was really disappointed that the CD is not really a song collection.  It's a set of songs that were created from the first song that she wrote.  It's not a collection.  I really liked the first CD and I really loved the second one.  It's like a compilation of songs that she wrote before she started recording her first album.  I liked the songs on the second CD, but I hated the songs on the third CD.  I was very disappointed that she decided to do a collection of songs that were not really songs.  I was so excited to see what she would do with the third disc.  I was hoping that she would create a new song.  I'm not a fan of compilation albums.  I like more albums.  I like to know what the songs are about before I buy them.  I was thinking that she would have an amazing album and then I'd find out that she just did songs that were very different from the songs on "Your Body Is a Wonderland".  I was hoping that she would do something new
