Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: First of all, this is a very good song, but the production is subpar. When it hits the chorus it just sounds like a very, very tired song. The song is also pretty boring. But the lyrics are very good. I like the song because the chorus goes on without a break for a good while, and the music is awesome. But the production is just a little off, and i agree with the other reviewer. It sounds more like a demo than a finished song.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

I wanted the English version so very much.

Amazon review: I love this album. I've had many of the albums from this band, but this is my favorite.  I've been a fan of this band since the beginning of their career.

I've always felt that this band was on the cusp of huge things and it's very evident through their music and lyrics that they were going to be great.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Bethel fan, and have been ever since I first heard T.D. Jakes on the radio.  I have loved this band ever since.  As their name suggests, they are very passionate about God and church music, and have a very unique sound and style.  The way they sing and play their music is amazing.  I love them a lot.  They are my favorite worship band, and I highly recommend them.

Amazon review: I recently purchased this album on Amazon.  I thought it was excellent.  I've been listening to Bethel and just found them through my friend who has an account with them.  As soon as I heard "When I am baptized, I will be a new creature," I knew they were on to something good.  The album is very good.  The lyrics are very well thought out and the music is very powerful.  I just purchased their new album (I know, I'm late) and am enjoying it very much.  Although I'm still not quite finished, I am enjoying listening to it.

I'm a little late on this one, but it's for my daughter. I really love it!

I think this is the most well rounded album, with all the good and bad. I would rate this at a 9 - 10, but I agree with many of the other reviews, this is not "the best" of the bunch. I would rate it a 7.5.

I just purchased this for my daughter- I love it! I have her other CD's and a few I bought her, but this one is her favorite. This one is more upbeat with the good and not so good in the album. I have many different types of songs, but this one is one of my favorites!

I just read about this album and loved the song "I Love You" and I was so bummed that it wasn't included. I would buy this CD for my son's birthday. He was not a fan of the first two, but has loved this one.
I love this CD!

This is the first CD that I bought for my daughter- I liked it a lot! She plays it over and over and has told me that it makes her feel happy and she really likes it. We have other CDs, but I really like this one.

I've really been enjoying the music that I have gotten from the CD's that my daughter has been giving me this year. I thought that I would like this one, but it was not what I expected.

I love this CD, it's good for kids and adults. If you can believe it, my daughter likes it, too!

I just bought this CD for my daughter. She likes it. I'm not sure why, but I think it has something to do with the lyrics. It's good for kids and adults, it's just that the lyrics are a little hard to understand sometimes.

I love the songs on this CD. It is just a great CD for us. One of my favorite songs is "No One to Love" by Anne Murray. It is about a woman who is trying to be strong for her son. They are very similar to each other. I don't know if the author was trying to show that a parent should be there for their child (I think she was), but I know that I've been strong for my son.

This is a really good CD, the first one that I got for my daughter. She likes it, too! I don't know why it is so good, but I like it.

I love this CD. I have two children who are very different. I got this CD for my oldest daughter, and I love it. The only thing, she really doesn't like is that the music is always too fast. But other than that, it's a great choice.

I have a daughter that is not very good with music, but we love her and all her favorite songs. I bought this CD to help her learn to love music and it has helped a lot. She really likes it, it is different but still a good choice for a little one.

I love this CD, it is very good for kids and adults. I have a son who is autistic and he has been singing this song every morning since he was born. He is now 20 months old and it really helps him get through the day.

I would rate this an 8.5. I have it in my car and I have been singing it all the time. It helps me sleep and it makes me feel happy. I would rate it a 7.5 for singing it to my son. I would rate it higher for how it makes me feel.

I have a 2 1/2 year old son with autism. He does not like music. I bought this CD expecting it

Amazon review: This was originally a video on Youtube but it just got taken down now and I guess they don't want people to know about this band because it's not a porn video but rather a "video" that people can upload onto the internet.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold.

Amazon review: I'm totally bummed by this.  I ordered a couple of songs for my dad for Christmas and he got a CD of all new music instead of a music cd as he had requested - he is a big country music fan and this was the first thing he purchased from amazon.  My dad had been a loyal member of the amazon family for a long time and I would have gladly paid full price for these songs if I had known about this.  Now I have to buy him a music cd and we'll have to wait until spring when he can return it to amazon for a refund - and I will have to get him a new CD to boot.  I was not happy at all and I would have rather ordered all new songs for Christmas from amazon and my dad's request was to receive a music cd instead of a music cd that was new.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What a disappointment!  Why do we have to go through this again and again?  Why can't they just release a nice straight-up piano album and leave the soft jazz and pop crap at the door?  This is like a new album by Creed, except with a different name.  It's a terrible album, with a lot of great stuff interspersed with a lot of terrible stuff.  I'm not a big fan of Creed, but I am a big fan of albums that put together a great set of songs, make me smile, and leave me feeling satisfied.  I'm not sure why Creed doesn't release albums that sound like this, but at least they give us a reason to buy their albums.  I won't buy this album, and I'm not sure why anyone would want to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very nice and mellow jazz CD, but I won't recommend this to anyone who doesn't like jazz.  Even though it's "jazz" it has some really bad jazz songs, so it's not a good album for those of us who like jazz.  The only good songs on this album are the ones where the musicians play together, and they play well, but for the most part are very "jazz" and don't make me want to listen to music anymore.  This album is a waste of time.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not bad, but I was hoping for something a little more exciting than this, like maybe a little more progressive or some other kind of music.  It would be good for me to hear some new music that I didn't know about, and I've heard some great music in the past few months, but I can't remember what it was, and I didn't know where to find it.  So this new album is new to me, so I'm listening to it a little more than usual.  I don't know why they just put "new" on the cover, it's not new to me, or to the CD.  I'll be getting other albums from them in a couple of weeks, so I'll think about this one now.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a waste of time.  It's a good album, but it's an album to listen to at least a few times before moving on to the next album.  There are some good songs on this album (particularly the last song), but for the most part it's a bunch of filler.  I'm not impressed, and I don't know why this album is worth my time.  It's just a waste of my time.  I'd rather listen to music from bands that are really good, like U2 or Creed.  I'll buy the next Creed album if it's good music, but I'm not going to waste my time on this album.

It's like listening to a bunch of songs that I've never heard and I can't figure out how to make sense of it.  The lyrics were so bad that I couldn't even remember the words.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: Wow, what a great album! This is one of my favorites, and I've been listening to it for a few days now. The song "Wake Me Up When September Ends" is the best so far.

It's very relaxing so it's a great album to play while doing chores or doing household stuff.

Amazon review: I just listened to this album for the first time after a long hiatus. When I first heard it, I was in awe. I felt I had heard it all before, but I was wrong.

Amazon review: This album is such a good listen.  I got it recently and loved it.  It's a little more introspective than the others in the series but I don't think it has that much of a difference.

Amazon review: I've got to be honest here: I don't think I would have enjoyed this album as much as you guys did.  I'm not really a fan of Korn's music, but I did like the first three albums, and this one is a step down for me.  I feel like I didn't like the vocals, the music is fine, but I'm not really a fan of anything that comes from Korn.  The songs are great, but they just don't have that something special, and I think I would have preferred an album that had more variety.  I know I sound like a complete idiot here, but I am very happy to have discovered this album, and I'm glad you guys have listened to it.

Amazon review: I was really excited to have gotten this album as I have been waiting years to hear it.

Amazon review:   I really like this album.  I like the new music, the songs on this album are good.  The first three albums are really good, but this time it's a step down.  I'm still not sure how I feel about the vocals, but I'm going to give it a chance.  The songs are not as good as the others, so I don't know if I will like them or not.  I will give this album a listen and I will let you know how I feel once I am done with it.

Amazon review: I have never been as disappointed in an album this year as I have been with this one.  The material is not bad, it's just not a good album.  I just don't feel like I have to put up with it, and I don't like it.  I didn't like it because of the same reason that I don't like the other albums.  I don't like the vocals and I don't feel that the music is that good.  I just don't feel like I am listening to any of their best material.  I was impressed with the first three albums, and this album is the fourth bad one.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I love the name of this track, "You Were Always There", because my husband and I have shared the same last name (and therefore have the same first and middle names).  This is a great track from a great group.  For those of you who don't know, The Monkees is a group that featured a group of teens and teenagers who took on a group of adults, and did it better.  This is a great track.

Amazon review: This is not an album you would normally expect to find at a chain like Wal-Mart.  It is a "progressive rock" album with a variety of styles and themes, some of them Christian.  I was not a fan of the first album by this band (My Favorite Things), but I was still surprised to find this one.  The album is quite long, and I think I can listen to it while working, or in bed.  It is also very entertaining.  The music is very good and has a great rock and roll feel to it.

Amazon review: I received this album as a gift from my sister for my Birthday.  Since I had never heard of either band, I didn't know what to expect.  I was not disappointed.  I'm glad I decided to have it as my birthday gift to myself.  I love it!  I feel like it is a good representation of the band's music.  I enjoy it and can listen to it for hours.

Amazon review: This is an album that if you are looking for something different, or are looking for something that has a different feel to it than what you are used to, then this is the album for you.  The first CD is just like your average hard rock album, and the second CD is different and unique.  I would recommend this album to anyone, but if you are looking for a different type of music, this is probably not it.

Amazon review: This is a CD that I actually purchased because I had been hearing so much about it on the radio.  I listened to the album and was immediately hooked!

Amazon review: This is a great album to listen to when feeling blue, or in the middle of a bad breakup.  It is very calming, and I find that it is very healing.

Amazon review: I do not like to judge, but I know that I have been spoiled by all the other albums that are available in the iTunes Store.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I hate to be a stickler for the word "Country" but I guess it's not wrong to say that this album is country. It is full of country twang and jangling guitar lines, but the lyrics are not country. They are not even really rap lyrics at all. It just sounds like country music to me. If anyone wants to argue that the lyrics are not country, I will point you to this review I wrote a few months ago.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

This album is full of songs like "Don't Give Up," "So Young," "Somewhere Out There," and "No More."  I'm not a huge fan of the title track, but I think it's worth a listen.  The rest of the songs are all great and worth checking out.  My only complaint is that the song "Sink or Swim" is a little short.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I like this song. I really like the lyrics and the beat. I like that it's easy to sing along to. I like that it's not in the same genre as most songs, and that it's different enough to make it interesting.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don'st know why Apple is the only company that is selling these. I'm not the biggest Apple fan, but I really like the "i" in "Apple". I don't know if I'll buy the iPhone 5, but I will definitely buy this. If I could get one for my birthday, I'd definitely buy this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't listen to this album without singing it.  This song is a classic. I would actually get this album just because it was released. I'd buy it not only for the songs, and I would buy this album just because it's Beatles, period.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best Beatles songs  ever. It's fun to listen to and sing along to. I love how you can tell each song has a different sound and a different feel. It's a very good song. I don't know why the Beatles aren't selling more singles and albums. This is one of my favorites. I wish they had more songs like this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the Beatles. This is one of my favorite Beatles songs of all time. I love it because it's a fun song. In an era when I don't really know what to do with my time, I have always found the Beatles to be the most creative. As such, this song is one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song was pretty bad in the original version. But now it is one of my favorite songs. I'm a huge fan of the Beatles and I love this song.  It's just a great song. I was surprised when I heard it for the first time and I am happy that I did. It's a good song. I don't know why the Beatles don't sell more singles and albums. I hope they do, because this song is a great song.

Amazon review: I love THIS song. I don't know why Apple is the only company that is selling these. I'm so mad that Apple is the only company that is selling these.  I don't know what to do with my time, so I just listen to these songs on my iPod.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've had this song on my iPod for about a year now and I still love it.  The rhythm is really good and the harmonies are awesome.  The only thing that I've noticed is when you play it on the radio, the song comes in full speed and then cuts out.  I don't know why it's like that. The song is great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very disappointed in this album. This is the second Beatles album I have bought (the first being Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).  I thought the first album was great and I was wrong, but that's what happens when you buy multiple Beatles albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If yo listen to the lyrics, terrible!  nice, pop melody though which is probably why it's so popular.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is probably the best album of the year, and I think it is probably the best album of the year.  If you are a fan of 'pop' you will probably love this.  If you like a more electronic sound, you will probably like this.  I am a fan of both.  Although the lyrics are a little more cryptic, they are still very good.  I highly recommend this for people who are fans of a more 'pop' sound.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked this album.  It is a great mix of rock, rap, and folk.  I don't know which one is my favorite but they all work together.  I would suggest this to anyone who likes a really different sound.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for about three months and there are moments that leave an impression on me.  When you are listening to a CD and there is a sound that is different than just the music but it is in the sound of the music that is different than just the music.  I am listening to this CD now on my iPod, and I find that this CD has left me with a number of memories.

Amazon review: This is a CD that has been a while in the making.  I have been trying to get a hold of an album by a band that I have heard of a long time, and this CD has been one of those albums that has been on my "want" list.  I was really surprised when I found out that it was not an album by a band that I had heard of before.  I was even more surprised when I found out that the band, Caravan Palace, is a one man band.  I have gotten to listen to this CD on the road and I have never been more impressed.  You will have to listen to it to see how it is done.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album was a well written and produced album.  It made me think in a different way, and I found myself looking for something else.  I have heard that this is a "good" album, but this is one of those albums that left me wondering if I could have done it better, but I couldn't.  Great album overall!
