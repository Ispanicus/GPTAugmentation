Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Deftones for a long time.  I was looking for another band that had good music, and this was the band that I found.  All I can say is, I love this band.  I love the way the vocals sound.  I love the way the instrumentals sound.  The lyrics,  you have to listen to them for yourself, but the ones I've heard so far are awesome and they really have a unique sound.  This CD  is great.  I am having trouble getting into it, because I am a huge fan of the Deftones and I was looking for another band that I like,  but this doesnt sound that great.  I was looking for a band like  Soundgarden,  because I have heard them all and I have loved all of their songs, but this  is  not it for me.  I am glad I got this CD and I think I just found my favorite band.  I can't wait to hear what the future has in store for them.  This CD is good and it is a good song to play in the car.  I think this is a good band,  but I think this is a  little  too  good.  I would buy it again if I could, but if you really want to like this  band  you can't.  I'm sorry.  This is not what a band like  Deftones are supposed to sound like.  It is just not it.  I don't think I  would recommend this CD  to anybody.  It is not good.  I hope to be able to find another band that  I like.  I hope that this  band  does  well.  I hope to find another band  that I like.  I don't know who I am going to listen to next.  This is not  what I am looking for.  I'm sorry.  I  am a big Deftones fan,  and I am glad that I found this band.  I hope they have another CD,  because they are one of the many bands that I have loved.  I am  hoping that this band continues to have  good music.

Amazon review: This album does not have the same impact on me any longer.  It was a nice way to pass the time while driving.  The songs are not great,  but the songs are good.  They have a unique sound, and the vocals are decent.  I like the bass part in "All of this Is My Fault" a lot.   I don't know what it is.  The drums are a little too light.  There is also a little too much guitar in the last song "The End" and it just makes the song sound bad.  It sounds like a punk rock song.  I think they need to cut down the guitars a little more.  I wish they would release another album.  I hope they will continue to have a good  time.  I am going to buy another CD.  This album is great,  but not as good as their first album.  I'm going to buy their second album even though I don't think it is as good as their first album.

Amazon review: I bought this CD  to see if they were really a great band.  I did not expect to like this CD as much as I do.  I really like their first album,  but I don't think that this album is as good as their first album.  The lyrics are really good,  but the singing is not as good as their first album.  I don't think I can say much more about this CD.  I do not know if I can give it a 4.5 or not.  I am not even sure if I can give it a 3.  It is not that bad.  I'm giving it a 4.5.  I like the song  "All of this is my fault" a lot.  It is a good song.  I don't really know what it is.  I like the music.  I do not know how they are going to sound like next.  I do not know if this is a good band or not.  I do not know if this is a good album or not.  I hope they will have another CD.  I hope that the band will continue to have a good time.  I would buy their second CD,  because it is a good album.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: The most "distant" music I've ever heard.  The voice of the narrator is the only thing that makes me stay awake at night. The music itself is beautiful and well done, but the voice of the narrator is truly amazing.  I've been listening to this album a lot (it took me a few months to get through all of it), and I've been thinking about getting another copy.  I'm not sure I'll ever go through the whole album, but it's not bad.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: It was an interesting surprise to see John Legend (who I had heard of) sing this in concert.  I have no idea how well the crowd responded to the song and/or the audience.  When he sings "Mama, I've gone away," there are a lot of people who join in the chorus.  But, when he sings "Daddy, I've come back.", there is silence.  The crowd is silent.  And the audience is silent.  That is, until he starts singing "I've got a feeling that I'm gonna need you."  He starts singing that.  There is a big smile on his face.  He is looking directly into the eyes of all of the people.  After the song, he says "Thank you very much."  He was very well received by the audience.  I will definitely look for the next one.  It was a good concert to see.

Kitty Loves Jones is a New York City based musician, songwriter and producer. She's the Co-founder and Artistic Director of the NYC-based rock band The Lonesome Friends. She co-wrote and produced the song "The Way" with the band.

She was born in Brooklyn, NY and raised in Pennsylvania. She currently lives in Queens, NY.

It's been said that there is no other songwriter or  artist that is as prolific and versatile as Michael Stipe. His lyrics are darkly humorous and full of profound messages, and his melodies are haunting and melodically captivating. "The Way" is a song that I was really excited to hear him sing. In this song, he sings over an electronic drum beat. The lyrics are very relatable and the melody is haunting and beautiful. I have to say that this song really is one of my favorites of his. I think the song is perfect for any type of mood or environment.

I really like this song and I think that it would be a great addition to any playlist.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Not my favorite, but I have liked so many songs by this band.  However, I do like the first and last songs.  I like the song, but the rap is way too out of line for me.

Amazon review: I have mixed feelings about this album, it sounds too perfect to me.  The songs from that era are perfect, but the songs from this era are average, but not terrible.

Amazon review: I like the song and the message.  But I'm going to have to say that the song has nothing to do with the message.  The song is not about being a good parent.  I have never heard of anyone wanting to have a child until they are no longer on this planet.  Then the song starts.  I have my doubts that the message is that they should have been a parent long before they died.  Either way, the song is not for me.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
