Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I have a very strong dislike for the new cd as I think it is a watered down version of the original.  I have a very strong dislike for the new cd as I think it (or any other cd) should be in the same price range as the original.  And if you look at the price of the cd you will see it is a lot cheaper than the original.  I would rather buy the original cd in the US than this one  in the UK.  They both sound the same to me.  So I will not be buying this cd.

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for my father to listen when he was listening to jazz and country and some blues.  Its pretty good but I do not get the feeling that this is his kind of listening.  I don't think its a jazz cd.  I think its more like a blues cd.  Its kinda like listening to one of those blues cd that you would listen to with your girlfriends.  Its not real.  I have a hard time getting into it.  I don't have a problem with the music (I listen to some of the songs all the time) but I don't like the fact that this is an older recording (and it is) and it sounds like someone that knows what they are talking about.  I think this is a good cd for someone who likes to listen to older recordings but like me I would listen to this CD all the time on CD player in the car.  I would love to hear the original cd but I have been told its not as good as this one.  I am not a big jazz fan but I do like blues and country.  This may change my opinion on the cd but for now I think it's a good cd.

Amazon review: I agree with you that the only thing that bothered me is the song "I Don't Care."  I don't think I've ever heard that song before, or any other song, that is so completely and utterly devoid of emotion.  The only thing I can think of is having a hard time listening to something and then just sitting and watching the stars for a while, and then leaving the room to go outside and feel the cool night breeze.  I can't really get into it.  It is not a song I would want to hear over and over again.  I have listened to it a few times and even tried to sing the chorus of it in the shower, with the water running.  I have done this in the past, and the only thing that I can think of is that I really don't like the sound of it.  It sounded to me like someone that was having a hard time singing it and was trying to sound as bad as possible.  I really don't think this song is good.  I can't see myself going back to it.  It is just the one song out of the whole CD that I do not like.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  Why does the world need another country cd?  The only good thing about this cd is the sound quality.  I have a lot of cd's that were poorly recorded and I have not been able to get the sound quality that I wanted.  They sound like they were recorded from a tape recorder.  I am not sure if the cd is the sound quality, or the cd is just not good.  I have not been able to find a better cd in the price range.  I am sorry that I had to listen to this cd.

Amazon review: The CD definitely sounds better than the cd that came with my car stereo.  The CD is almost twice as big - it is almost as long - as the cd that came with my car stereo.  I do not understand why the producer would put all the songs on one CD.  I really don't like most of the songs on this CD.  Every time I hear one of those songs I think it's a little too country.  I have listened to many country cd's in the past and I would never say that any of them are not country.  I think that it is not a country cd.  The only song that I absolutely have to like is "I Don't Care."  I don't think this is a country song.  I think that it is a song that a country singer would not sing.  The song is not country enough.  I don't understand how you can sing it and not be country.  I have listened to it a few times and I don't think that I really like it.  I think that it is nice to have a country cd every now and then, but I think it is better to have a cd that has a

Amazon review: I'm glad I bought this.  I was able to find it at a good price.  It's a nice collection of songs.  I think it would be good to have the songs in order, and that would be, I think, the only way to enjoy the album. I mean, I'm not really a fan of "Criminal Minded" or "Ain't No Fun Tonight" or "Punk'd" because they are just, they are just filler songs that do nothing to the album as a whole.  I just feel that having the songs arranged in the order that they appear in the album would be a good idea.  But I just don't get the hype.  I mean, 50 Cent has been in the business about 15 years.  So I can't tell if he is good or bad.  Does he have a new album coming out any time soon?  I hope so.  I would love to hear it.  I mean I'm a fan, but I just can't tell if he is a good or bad artist.  I just don't get the hype.  I like his style, but he seems like a two-bit talent.  I don't know if he's a rapper, singer, or some sort of a rapper/singer/songwriter.  I mean, I can't tell the difference.  I just like his style, and I think it's good.  But I just don't get the hype about 50 Cent. I mean, he is a two-bit talent.  I just like the music, but I just don't like the hype.  I mean, it's a good album, but I just don't get the hype.

I know it is a great album, but I just can't get past the fact that they are using new songs for the album, and I think it is kind of lame. The band has done so much good, and for them to make a new album just to use some old songs and not use them at all is just too much. If this was still a band that made music that was different and unique and the most original of them all, then it would not have gotten this much praise. What would they have done for a second record? This is just too many good songs on this one and I think I will just wait for the second and third albums.

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

Amazon review: I have a song that is stuck in my head. I don't know why. It's a song that is stuck in my head. I've listened to it so many times that I don't know why it is still stuck in my head. I have tried writing it down but it's just too hard to remember. I have tried listening to it over and over again. I guess I just need to go through the song again. Just to force myself to remember the lyrics and the melody.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Judy Rodriguez - Lyrics by Judy Rodman

There once was a little girl named Judy Rodman
I used to meet her at the mall
She would buy me my favorite candy
It was a secret that she loved to steal
She would tell me that she had a secret
But I was not to know it
She used to buy me my favorite candy
It was a secret that she loved to...

Judy Rodriguez - Lyrics by Judy Rodman

...all over the place - all over the place- all over the place
- all over the place - all over the place- all over the place
(all over the place - all over the place- all over the place)
- all over the place - all over the place- all over...

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I have not been a fan of the band since their days in New Jersey, but they have grown in popularity and are now one of my favorite bands. They have a very unique sound and they all have a unique style. I am really happy they are playing at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

I purchased this album on recommendation from my husband, as he is a fan. He has been an avid fan since the band formed in the late 80's and has been an early supporter in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. My husband has always said that he loves the music and that he has listened to the band for 15 years! His passion for the band has been a big help to me, as I have always struggled to find the perfect music for my son. I'm so glad I have the opportunity to promote this band to others out there.

I'm a fan of the music for many years now but never bothered to buy anything by any of the current or new artists mentioned on the back cover. I was thrilled to be able to purchase this album from the band itself! They have a very unique sound and I'm very glad I can share it with others!

The quality of sound is very good, and I was excited to find out that the song "All I Want In Life Is You" was performed on the album!!!

This album is such a great, classic album. It has some great songs but it is not for everyone. It is for those that really love the music. You can't help but feel that the music really touches you on a very deep level. The music is really uplifting and you will find yourself humming it after you listen to it.

This album was a great purchase for me. I am a fan of the band and this album is a great addition to my collection! I highly recommend it!

This album is really good. I have bought this album on recommendation from my friend, who is a diehard fan. He recommended the band because of their unique sound. He is a great fan and he is happy to have helped me find this album.

The album was a great purchase for me. I was excited to find out about the song "All I Want In Life Is You" on the album. It is a great song and I am happy to have added this song to my collection.

I have listened to this album and I feel that this is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I have been a fan of the band and I have been a long time fan of Demby, but I would not say that I am a diehard fan. I have listened to this album and I have listened to the songs a few times and I have really liked the songs and the music and I really enjoy the music. I am a fan of music and I have tried listening to a lot of different music but I have not really liked the music that I have listened to.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This one is from a group called the Mellow Tone Crew, and the song is called "The Song of the Year". I really like this song. It is a really cool song, and the lyrics are really good, too. The lyrics are "You're on the wrong track, but I don't want to be on the wrong track. I don't want to be on the wrong track. I don't feel this way."

Amazon review: These songs are from a band called the Bad Brains, and they are called "Sticks & Stones" and "You're a Punk". I like both of these songs. Well, I like both of these songs, but I think that "Sticks & Stones" is a better song. The lyrics to this song are "I thought it was my destiny, but I'm not sure if I was meant to be, I don't know if I was meant to be. I'm not sure if I was meant to be, I don't get it. I don't know if I was meant to be, I don't know if I was, I don't know if I was."

Amazon review: This is a fun song. I really like the lyrics. I like the way that he sings it. He sounds like his voice is about to burst. I like the song, and I like the artist, and I would recommend it. I don't know why he sings "I don't know if I was meant to be" like that, but it works.

Amazon review: This is a song from a band called the Flaming Lips. They are a band that is known for their unique sound, and I thought that they had a good song here. The song "Gravity" is an excellent song. It is a very good song. The lyrics to this song are "I am floating in the air, I don't know if I'm falling or flying, I don't know what I'm thinking, I don't know if I'm thinking, I don't know if I'm sleeping, I don't know if I'm dreaming. I don't know if I'm dreaming, I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I hate this album so much.  The voices are so over-saturated, they are almost unrecognizable except for the fact that they are all male, which I don't mind, but there is no consistency. I have listened to this twice. The first time I was able to figure out the pieces and the second time I could not.  The music itself is not that bad, but the voices are all so badly pitched and pitched out that it is a pain to listen to.  The only thing that sounds remotely like the sound of a violin is the bass part in the introduction.  The voices have a real high pitch and are all so different, they are really hard to distinguish.  If I had the money to buy this album again, I would go with the CD version.

Amazon review: I bought this because I liked the cover.  It was a good song.  I have since learned that the title is misleading.  This is not a'song' but a collection of songs.  The voice and instruments are in a different language.  Some of the songs are very short and others are the same as the originals.  I can hear the differences, but can't make out the words.  The music is not my thing, but I like the sound of it.  I wish I could afford the expensive CD version so I could listen to it again.

Amazon review: Toni Braxton's voice is beautiful on this song.  It's not a screaming song, but it's very emotional.  I've heard this song before, but I'm so glad I found it again.  I'll be buying the rest of the albums, and I'll be seeking the next one.  It's very beautiful, and the lyrics are very fitting for the song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewers. This album is a bit short.  It starts with a good song but then quickly runs out of songs.  I'm not sure if this was a conscious decision or not, but I feel like it might be a little too short.  I'm not sure what is wrong with it.  It starts with a great song, but then it's not as good as the rest.  It's a bit too short.  I'm just not sure why this is the case.  This is a great album and it's worth the money.  I've been listening to this album for a few years, but I really fell in love with this album.  This is a good album for people who love music and love Toni Braxton.  This is a good album to have at your house.  I listened to this album for a good hour.  I was not bored.  I'm very happy with this album.  I recommend it.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: A really fine song, and I'm glad it's not just a collection of songs. It's got a great melody, but the lyrics are all wrong. It should be about the love of a guy and girl for each other. We don't see too many songs like this.

It should have a love song, about the love of a man and a woman for the person to love. We don't see too many songs like this. It should be a love song, about the love of a man for a woman, but it is not, it is about a guy and a girl for each other.

Amazon buy review: A really good song, but you should change the lyrics to be a love song, about the love of a man for the person to love, because a love song is about the love of a man and a woman for each other, and this song is not about the love of a man and a woman for each other.
