Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.  Most of the songs on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous.  I've listened to this about a dozen times, thinking it would "grow on me", but I just don't enjoy it.

I think the lyrics are stupid and the music is dated.  I would like to hear a song with better lyrics.  I have listened to this several times and each time I thought there was a mistake in the lyrics.  Maybe it is a song from the old days with an alternate singer.

Amazon review: First of all, I have listened to this album about a month ago or so.  This is an album with my favorite songs.  My favorite of the album, "Don't Be Cruel", is a timeless song.  The song "Love Is Here To Stay" is also a well written song.  However, the rest of the songs are not so great.  "I Can't Let Go" is a great song, but the rest of the songs are average.  I really don't understand why they chose to change singers.  I would rather hear a song by Jon Anderson.

Amazon review: I was looking for a Jon Anderson album while on vacation.  I had never heard this album before so I decided to purchase it.  I have listened to this cd once and I would like to hear Jon Anderson sing the songs that he did on the other Jon Anderson albums.  They could have left in the original singers but I think they made a mistake by changing singers.  I will not buy another album by Jon Anderson because he has changed singers too many times.

Amazon review: I bought a cd with Jon Anderson singing "Gonna Fly Now" as it is on the CD.  I was looking for this song when I purchased the CD.

It seems like they just sang the songs and the singers did not know what they were singing about.

Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: The album's title is misleading.  This is not a greatest hits compilation.  I would have preferred a compilation album of songs from the first two albums.  But it's a good album nonetheless.  They have the same drummer, the same drummer that played on their first two albums.  And they just added a great singer, but I don't hear the influence of the other members.  The music was good, the singing was good, the production is good.  The album could have used a little more guitar, but the piano is the best thing about it.  It has that 60's feel to it.  I would have preferred a compilation of songs from the first two albums, but it's a good album nonetheless.

Amazon review: You know what?  The original album was better than this one.  This album is just a re-recording of the original album.  The only difference is that they added a great singer and a decent drummer.  My favorite from the album was the last song.  I know it's not the best song on the album, but I still like it.  It's a great rendition of The End of the World.  It's the best song on the album.  If you like music from the 60's, you should have this one.

The keyboards and bass are better.  The guitars are better.  The original is a great album.  The re-recording is great.  The vocals are better.  The instruments are better.

But I don't think anyone is interested in an old album.  I don't think anyone is interested in buying an old album.  If you want to buy an old album, buy an original.

Amazon review: This review is for the vinyl LP version.  Definitely not disappointed with this pressing, first off it is heavy,it feels even heavier than 180 grams. The mastering also seems pretty good, drums are tight and highs are bright, the saxophone especially shines. The stereophonics are just as good and the sound stage feels quite broad even with my closed back headphones. My favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one LP, they weren't.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: I bought this album because there was a good review of the album on Amazon. I got this album because I love bands like All That Remains. The song selection of this album is great.

It was a little disappointing because the songs were very slow and the vocals didn't seem as good as they did on the first album, but that is what makes a great album, songs that don't sound like they were made in the 1980's.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Bob Dylan should know better - he no longer has a voice.  Moral of the story - don't get old and think you can still sing.  This also applies to Harry Nilson, Paul McCartney, etc.

Amazon review: The first thing you need to know about Bob Dylan is that he can sing.  That's the first thing, and that is the first thing that you need to know about him.  Now, the second thing is that he has the ability to write melodies, but he's only capable of writing a few good melodies.  The one he wrote for this tune is one of the best I've ever heard.  The lyrics are a real mess, but the melody he wrote is so good that I'm actually sorry I've heard it.  It's really sweet.  There's a lot of filler and filler, but the message he's trying to get across is one that is pretty simple.  I've never seen a song so focused on the lyrics before that was so lacking in the melody of the song.  There's a lot of filler in here too and it's all too easy to get lost in the lyrics and forget the melody.  The only reason this song is here is because Bob Dylan did it first.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Not what I was looking for- I wanted a reading of the sanskrit, the word for word definitions and the translation. The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.

Amazon review: An interesting introduction to the music and music theory of the 17th century from the perspective of a musician.  I personally found this to be a very enjoyable read.  It is very well written and I enjoyed the history of music as it is presented in this book.  This book was not just about the music of the 17th century, but it also had some interesting anecdotes about the lives of many of the composers, composers friends, and composers of other genres.  The only negative thing I can say about this book is that it is a little too long overall.  This book only covers a small period of time and I would have preferred if it had had a lot more of the music as it was not as interesting as it could have been.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to the entire disc, along with a few other albums.  This is the first album I have heard of William Bolcom, founder of the Bolcom Family.  I am a big fan of the music, and have been looking for a new work by him.  When I first heard this album, I was impressed with the sound and the amount of information included.  I have been able to get a lot out of the music and enjoy it greatly.  The music is not as complex as one might expect from a family like the Bolcoms, but it is well arranged and the music is well arranged and is not a bunch of random notes and notes.  I think this album is worth checking out.  It doesn't have a lot of "real" music, but it has some great music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great compilation of all of the Bolcom Family tracks from the 1970s and 1980s.  The sound quality of this album is better than most compilation albums I have listened to, but the CD is a little short and the songs seem to be a little longer than they are on the album.  I have been a huge fan of the family for many years, and the music has been a great source of inspiration for me.  I am looking forward to checking out the rest of their albums.  I don't really know what to expect from this album, except to give it a five star rating, but I have been listening to their music for years and have never been disappointed with their music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't seen this one yet but it sounds good.  I have heard of this family and some of their music, but it is nice to have a copy of their entire collection.  The CD is a little short and I don't know if the album will be released in a different version, but I like the fact that I can listen to it online and it won't be a little short.  I haven't been able to find the group on the net, but there does seem to be a lot of music on the net, so if you know of a site that has the Bolcom Family, let me know, I would like to have it.  Good job on finding the album!

Amazon review: This CD is excellent from beginning to end.  I listened to this CD for two days straight.  I have been a fan of the Bolcom family for years, and this CD is a great introduction to their music.  The songs on this CD are short and easy to listen to.  The sound quality is great and I can understand the words perfectly.  The band is not very good, and the sound is not very good, but that is what I expected from a family like the Bolcoms.  I am sure this CD will sell very well.

Amazon review: I was very excited for this album to come out. I have been a fan of Rivers and the =w= since childhood. I'm only on my first day of listening, but am in shock at the quality. Big hype over this album and all it is is random, jammy songs put into an album. Plus I've heard half of these songs in the past with the same quality or better. Not too impressed. But I will always purchase Weezer related albums for support, but after the green album, make believe, and now this.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle".

Amazon review: This song was written by Todd Rundgren.  Hall and Oats are good but Todd the best,I think he produced them along with Patti Smith ( Here comes the night ) and lots of other artists.  Most of their big hits were written by Todd.

Amazon review: It's an okay song, but the whole reason I downloaded it, was I was looking for a Kelli Glover song. Maybe she's in the background, but not worth the $.99. Sorry folks. I wish Kelli would put up a website and let us download some songs of hers. She can sing.

Amazon review: I have a friend who's a big fan of Rammstein, and we've talked about this song a few times. So, when I saw the song was being done by Todd Rundgren, I knew I had to give it a try. Boy, did it take me a few listens, but I'm glad I did. You've got to love Todd Rundgren. His lyrics are so clever and fun. I think he should be on "The View" and on Oprah!!!

Amazon review from a listener: This song was a gift for me this past Christmas and I still listen to it every night.  There is a beautiful message in the lyrics.  I have been a Christian for over 20 years, but the song has given me hope.  This will be played every weekend when my grandmother visits and I am sure she will sing along.  I will be downloading the entire album soon from Amazon.  It says you have to pay for it, but I encourage you to do it.  It's worth it and you will not be disappointed.  I recommend buying it because it will give you the tools to tell all your friends and family that you are a Christian - it really helps them with their problems and helps you to be a better person.  Thank you for sharing the song Belinda, a gift from God!  I wish I had heard it years ago.

Amazon.com review: This is a compilation CD of some of the Christian Christmas songs that we have chosen for this Christmas season.  I have been listening to the songs all day long today and they have given me lots of comfort and joy.  I am a Christian and I like Christian music but I just haven't heard enough of these songs.  I listen to them every day and just love them all.  I like all the different styles.  I like this CD because it has different styles and different artists on it.  I think the songs are very catchy and different.  I would like to say that I have listened to this CD over 50 times and I like all the different styles.  I love listening to it and I am really glad I bought it.  I would say if you would listen to this type of music you would like it, but if you don't like it then don't bother.  I would say this is a great album, but this is one of the albums I would just like to hear and I would like to hear it in a different style.  I like the songs on this CD and I would like to hear it in a slower style.  I really liked all of the songs on this CD, but I found myself listening to them all the time.  I am glad I bought it.  I would like to recommend this CD to others and I hope you will listen to it and enjoy it.  I would really like to recommend this CD to others.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

Amazon review:  

I've had the most amazing experience with this product. I was diagnosed with psoriasis, and tried all the psoriasis treatments, but nothing worked. I was frustrated. I felt really bad for not being able to find a cure for my psoriasis.

I was recommended to try this product, and I was really surprised to see how much of a difference it has made.

I have tried other psoriasis treatments before, and they didn't work at all. They would make things worse. I also tried other anti-psoriasis products, and none of them worked either. But, this product has made a difference!

I had to order the product through eBay. It was shipped for free, and it was very well packaged. The shipping was quick, and it arrived in 2 days. I received it so quickly that I was able to get a hair cut before it arrived, and my hair was healthy again.

I have tried other products before, and I was disappointed with them. No matter how well they worked for me, I couldn't figure out why they didn't work. But, I have to say, I haven't been disappointed with this product. I am not giving this a 5/5 score, but it's a 5/5. I am very happy with it.

I am recommending it to any people that are suffering from psoriasis, or at risk of it. It really does work, and it really has helped to change my life. I highly recommend it to people who are suffering from psoriasis, and for those at risk of it.

I will be ordering more of this product. And I will keep writing reviews.

I am recommending this to all the people who are suffering from psoriasis, and for those at risk.

I really like how easy it is to get the cream and the patches. I think I will be ordering more of this because it is cheap and it works. I have psoriasis and its not fun.

I just wanted to let you know that I am a huge fan of Love Knots and their music. I have been listening to their music over and over again. I love their music and love their messages. I am not a fan of the way they present their music, but their music is very inspiring. Their songs are written by someone who is very creative and has a great voice. I am happy for Love Knots and wish them the best.

I am so happy to find this information. I have been looking for the most effective way to control psoriasis. I have tried many different psoriasis treatments, but none of them have worked. I have been looking for a product that can truly help me control my psoriasis. I have tried so many different psoriasis products and none of them worked.

Amazon review: I used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out. It was really good, but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then.  I got this, because I had a $1 Amazon Mp3 credit awarded for a purchased CD. After skimming through a few other artists, I remembered this song and picked it up.  The acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original, which is a noticeably good thing and I would recommend this track.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this album since the first time I heard it on the radio, about 5 years ago.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it's not much better than the first time I heard it (I'd say it's probably the worst album of this year).  I've written about this album on my blog, and I'll probably be writing a few more reviews about this album here in the near future.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for about a year now.  I like most of the songs.  All of them except for the last song.  I like the songs, except the last one.  I think that the last song would have been a good candidate for a song for the soundtrack to the movie "Frozen".  The lyrics are so stupid and the lyrics are so ridiculous.  The vocals are very similar to The Chainsmokers, and the music is nothing to write home about.

Amazon review: This album is great for what it is.  It's a good solid album for those who don't like the sound of Britney Spears.  It doesn't have any real songs, but it does have some decent tunes.

Amazon review: I bought this album for a friend that really liked it, but didn't like the singing.  It's really good, but I did have to say something.  I agree with the person who wrote that it's great to listen to because it's very different from anything else in the world of pop music and different from anything else that I've heard.  The only thing that I didn't like was the singing of the lead singer.  It's very "soprano" and a lot of the time I would have liked to have heard her sing more like a soprano or alto.  As I've wrote before, I think that the voice itself is something that should be avoided in pop music.  I also think that if you are going to make pop music, you should just make pop music, and not worry about adding a voice that will be hated by a lot of people.  This album will appeal to some people and not appeal to others, but it's really good.  I've listened to it about 3 times and I'm still liking it.

Amazon review: I bought this album to listen to while I'm driving.  I didn't know what to expect because I didn't know what kind of music I'd be listening to.  I wasn't expecting a great album, but I was hoping for something different.  I didn't really like any of the songs on this album.  Some of them were OK, some of them were ok, and some of them were just boring.  The singing was good, but the voices in general were so bland and the arrangements were so blah that I didn't care about the music.  I just kind of sat there and listened to the songs.  The album itself is good, but the songs that I didn't care for are just not good.  I didn't like any of the songs that I did like.  I don't agree with the person who said it was good to listen to because it's different to anything else in the world of pop music.  That doesn't mean it's bad, but it's not the best pop album ever.  I do think that the voice itself is something that should be avoided in pop music, but as I've written before, I don't think that the pop music that we do today is any good at all.  I like this album a little bit more than I expected (I've listened to this album about 4 times), but I still don't think that the album is that great.  I still like it, but it's not a great album.  I think that it's a good album if you like pop music.  I liked a lot of pop music when I was younger, and I like pop music when I'm older.  I don't think that pop music should be completely avoided, but I think that it shouldn't be the first thing to be listened to.

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.

Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

This has been my first exposure to them and I thought they were great.  I'm glad I finally got to hear them live because I'm glad I finally got to experience The Band live...and then I'm glad I got to hear them again.  The next time I'm in the city, especially in the summer, I'm going to get tickets for one of their shows.  I'd love to see them live.  I'm glad I got to experience this band and they were great.  I'm glad I finally got to hear them after they had just released this album.  I'm glad I finally got to experience The Band live and got to see them perform again.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like the classics with a twist, this is the album for you.  Very well produced and very good sounding.  I bought this for a friend who had never heard any of these songs before.  He had a fun time listening to them and was pleased with how well it played.  I'm sure he will want a CD of all of Dylan's music.  This is worth every penny, especially since his name has become synonymous with the art of recording.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I loved the first three albums and this was the fourth I bought.  I was so in love with Dylan that when I bought this the first time I just had to buy the next one by Dylan.  This is so good and I recommend this album to everyone.  I've since bought all of his other albums and am looking forward to his new one coming out soon.  I'm not a big fan of the music he has put out in the last few decades but I do like this album and hope he records more music.  I have a feeling he will continue to be a great musician and not just a great entertainer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  It was a nice album.  The Dylan sound is very different from the Sinatra sound and if you're a Dylan fan you'll have a good time with this album.  I bought this album for my sister who loved it.  It was a good album.  I don't have any other Dylan albums but this one and I hope to find some more.  It's a good album.  I don't know if it will ever be released on cd so I don't have any other Dylan albums.  It's a nice album.

Amazon review:  I believe that Dylan did not give much of a chance to his fans, I purchased this for my sister to listen to with her husband.  The album was very good and I think Dylan was very good at the time as well.  I purchased 4 Dylan albums and this is the only one that I love.  It is a good album, but not really good.  It is not bad but I don't believe it is any good.  It has a few good songs here and there but it is very forgetfull.  I don't know why it was put out in the first place.  It just seems very rushed.  I think the people who put this out should have listened to the songs before they put the album out.  I don't think it is any good but I don't regret buying it.  But I don't have any of the other Dylan albums.  If you are a Dylan fan, go buy the other 4 and save a few bucks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I bought this album expecting to like it.  I think it is a very good album and I recommend it.  If you like Dylan, then buy all his albums and listen to them.  They are very good.  I have heard all of them and this is the only one that I love.  It is not really good but I don't think it is bad and I don't regret buying it.  So far it is the best Dylan album I have ever listened too.  It is a very good album with great songs.  The songs are very good.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Dylan.

Amazon review:  I think this is the best Dylan album that I have ever heard.  It's very good.  I only have one Dylan album and I have to listen to it over and over again.  This is the best one.  I don't know why Dylan put out so many albums and I don't know why he put out so many albums for so long.  I don't know what it is about Dylan but he always put out good music.  This is the best one I have ever heard.  I love Dylan and I believe he will always be a great musician and singer.  I've heard most of his albums and this is by far the best one I have ever heard.  I love it.  It's a very good album and I don't know why Dylan put out so many albums.  If you are a Dylan fan and have any questions leave them in the comment section.
