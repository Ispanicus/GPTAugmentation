Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

They have talent, they have a good sound, they are well produced and they have great lyrics.  I have to say that they are one of the top bands of all time.  They are also doing it for the right reasons.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I like the fact that they play two guitars at the same time on the intro.  The solos are also a tad more challenging, and I enjoy the way that the vocals are layered.  I don't like the drum tracks at all.  I think that the main reason there is no bass on the album is because the bass player (Lars) is the leader of the band, so it would be unfair to him to play a bass track without him.  The only thing I don't like is that the first song is a total departure from the rest of the album.  I can't believe the way that he changes the key of "It's Alright"  I guess that is what makes the song different, but it's still annoying.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I found this album to be very good, and the way that the songs are mixed together is awesome, it is a good mix of different styles.  I really enjoyed the way that they mixed the songs together.  I would have to say that the solos are the best part of the album, they really did a good job of mixing in solos that were not present in the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  It's worth it.  The solos are very nice, very different than the rest of the album, and the guitars are very nice and really sound like they are playing together.  The most difficult part is the drums, because they are very loud and you don't get to hear any of the drums.  The vocals are very good, and overall, I'd say this album is worth the $15 price.  I personally do not recommend the solo album, it's not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A classic.  Great songs.  Interesting arrangements.  The guitars are good.  The drums are OK.  The solos are good.  The vocals are good.  This is a good album to listen to, but it's not a great one.  I think the worst thing about it is the songs that are not in the album.  The lyrics are alright, but none of them stand out.  It's still a pretty good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the best album by a band I've ever heard, and by far the best one on the CD.  The sound is awesome, the solos are great, the vocals are nice, and there are a few songs here and there that are a little difficult to follow, but that's just me.  The only thing I don't like about this album is the fact that there is no bass part in the end.  It's a little bit of a let down when you hear a big band (I mean a 60-piece big band) with no bass, and no drummer.  It just seems like it would make more sense to have a bass player and a drummer.  The other thing that I don't like is the fact that there is no single version of "It's Alright"  The first version was on the album released to the public, and the second version is on the download.  The first version is a little bit out of place, and I think the second version is better.  I think the second version is better because it has the guitar solo and the song on the album.  In fact, this is probably the best solo album I've heard, but that's just my opinion.  I think this album is worth the $15 price, and if you have it, you should buy it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's not the best album.  But It's one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Really good sound.  Great songs.  Very interesting arrangements.  The vocals are very nice.  Really good rhythm.  Really cool album.  I would recommend it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album after hearing about the band from my best friend.  I have listened to it several times and it's always been a favorite.  The arrangement of the songs and the sound of the guitars are both awesome.  I think it's a great album.  I'm glad I bought it, it's worth every penny.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Really enjoying this mix.  I like this better then the original mix. I don't agree with the initial reviewer though, that the vocals are annoying in this mix.

Amazon review: This is not much of a mix, just a collection of many songs.  I have to say that some of the songs are really good, but most of them are just okay.

I guess I just don't like the way this guy plays music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It sounds like I am not the only one who thought this was a great mix.  It has some decent bass and drums, but the vocals are too annoying.  I just don't want to listen to a remix that has the vocals in it.  It is like listening to a song that has been mixed with the vocals in it, that is why I think it sounds like a bad remix.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of this guy.  I've gotten him on several occasions and he's always very nice. I've heard him when he's playing at his club and have always enjoyed it.

Amazon review: I liked this mix, and the song choices were good.  It's not a mix, but it is a good mix.  I don't think that it is a good remix.  The first song was not the best, but the other songs were good.  Maybe I don't have a taste for this kind of music, but the first song isn't a bad song.  The second song was okay, but then he goes into a little more of a dubstep/dubstep song "Heat Beats vol 1" that has a lot of good beats and some really good beats.  I think this is a good remix though.  The vocals are a little out of place.  They just seem to go in and out of track.  The bass and drums are good.  The first song has some good beats that work well with the bass and drums.  I think the bass and drums are a good mix.  The vocals really just blend in.  The only reason I gave this a three star rating is because of the vocals.  I don't know why they are there, but it is annoying.  They just seem to go in and out of the tracks.  I think that this is a good remix though.  The drums are good, and I like the bass and bassline.  The vocals on this are annoying, and seem to get in and out.  I really don't like this remix.

I think he should just use a more normal voice, and if he doesn't want to use his voice, then he could just change the vocals to normal.  I don't think that this is a good remix.  The vocals really blend in and out.  I don't think that this is a good remix at all.  The only reason I gave this a three star rating is because the vocals.  I don't like the vocals.  They

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have watched the video that started this review and it is absolutely fascinating, but the quality of the recording is terrible, especially compared to the quality of the video.  The sound is okay, but the quality of the audio is very poor.  I'm not sure what they were thinking but if you want to listen to this song you will need a very good quality headphones (I have Bose) that are really sensitive to sound.  I am pretty sure this is a mistake on the recording.  I hope the band will soon release a better quality version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a pretty interesting song.  I really like it.  It's not as good as the audio quality is, but I'm happy with the performance.  I have not heard any of the other members of the band and I've been listening to the recording for the past 40 minutes.  I do think this is a good song and hopefully the band will release a better quality recording.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the music.  I have found the band to be very interesting and I hope they will release a better quality recording soon.

Amazon review: I listened to "Tango" about a week ago and it really is one of my favorites!  I am impressed at the high quality the recording is getting.  I am also impressed at how well the band has improved since last year.  I think this song would be a hit if released as a single.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this band.  I have been listening to the music for a good 2 or 3 days now.  It's really great!  I wish the band would just release a better quality recording of this song.

Amazon review: I have listened to the song a couple of times and just have mixed feelings about the song.  The song is well produced and has the potential to be a hit.  I'm not quite sure if I'll buy the album (it's $8.99) or not, but I'm glad that I did.  This is my second time listening to the album and I'm even more impressed with it.  I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of the recording.  The music is very well produced and sounds great, but the quality of the recording is very poor, so in my opinion, they have not improved much since last year.  I don't know how they have not learned from last year.  I don't know that this song is a hit because it seems to be a hit based on the number of plays the band received, but I do think that the band is going to release a better quality recording of this song.  I would like to hear it, but I also don't think it needs to be a hit.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It is very well produced and sounds great.  I'm wondering if they are going to release a better quality recording, but we'll just have to wait and see.  I'm sorry to say that I am disappointed in the quality of the recording and would like to hear a better quality version.
