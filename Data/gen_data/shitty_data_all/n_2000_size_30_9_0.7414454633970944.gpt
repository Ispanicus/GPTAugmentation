Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to this album multiple times and there are still a few things which I don't like. I've never been able to figure out why the vocals are so bad. I've heard rumors that Rob is a bit of a "douchebag", but this is just ridiculous. The album is good if you like Malo and want to hear some of their earlier stuff (I know I do) but I think they've lost sight of the music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is probably the best album ever made by Malo. They are brilliant musicians and they have the ability to put together one of the best albums. Every song is absolutely superb.

Amazon review: This is one of the most amazing albums I have ever heard. I have been a fan of Malo since the first time I heard "Malo" and I loved "B.O.W." [which I also highly recommend], "Dos" and "Charmaine" [which I also highly recommend] so I was excited for this album. I was a little skeptical, but I loved every song and every one of the albums is great. I love all the songs, but the vocals in "Malo" are one of the worst I have ever heard. They are very annoying and in the end they hurt the album. But I love the rest of the album, love the songs, and love Rob's vocals. The only problem is that Rob has been recording for too long and he is now getting a little repetitive and the vocals are getting too much. I am just hoping this will get better because now I am starting to think that it is going to be a "special" album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Rob and his band are very talented musicians and this album is a great recording. I really like the album and I would recommend it to anyone who likes music. I would also recommend listening to MALO's first album "Malo" again, since this album is based on the first album.

Amazon review: Van Halen were never great nor prolific songwriters, mostly a good cover band with a livewire, athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock.  Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.  Loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band.  Unfortunately, whatever vocal talent he ever possessed, has long since evaporated.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review: I heard a lot of good things about this album so I bought it only to become disappointed. Many of the songs seem forced and repetitive if other hits they've had. I have it an honest listen several Times before actually returning it-for me, it was that bad. About the only good thing I can say is that Blink 182 has an awesome drummer.

Amazon review: I know many people are going to say this album is boring.  I think that's a really good thing.  I listen to a lot of rock and roll and country music.  But this is a rock album.  There's no ballads. In fact, there are no songs with a chorus.  If you want a slow song with a chorus, listen to a country album.  This album is a good way to listen to a rock album without the lyrics getting in your way.

A:

It's really difficult to recommend a book like this. While I can't guarantee that it will be better than any other book, it's certainly hard to find a book that will be anything other than a good read.
I have some notes about the book, but I don't have a lot to say about it.
The main problem I have with this book is that it's an awful book. It's one of those books that's well-written and enjoyable, but also has a lot of flaws. These flaws are quite obvious to anyone who has read the book before, but they're also quite obvious to anyone who hasn't.
If you're looking for a great book to read, one that's not only enjoyable, but also extremely well-written, look no further than this.

A:

I don't know if this is the right answer, but here goes: While it's not exactly my thing, it's certainly an interesting and thought-provoking read.
"Love" is a concept album by the band, and I think it's a good one.  It's almost too bad it's by one of the most popular bands of all time.  It's definitely worth the read.  It's got a lot of great songs, and some great lyrics.  It's quite short, too, which is great.

Amazon review: I was going to buy this album, but then I saw that the CD was only available on Amazon. I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to find it at Wal-Mart or Amazon, but it did. I was able to find it at Amazon, I ordered it, and I am very glad I did. I am not quite sure how to rate it, I liked the lyrics, but that's about it. But I was able to get it and it will be added to my collection.

I have bought similar albums before, and this one is by far the best one, but it does have a few issues that I would like to see addressed, such as the fact that the CD has the wrong music on it. The band is very good, but too much of the album is missing. The best part is, I can still listen to this album without

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: Those that have followed Grace and The Nocs, this is a disappointment.  Grace is much to talented a songwriter for this.  This is an artist like Picaso doing a paint by numbers.  If you liked "Never Going Back vs songs with meaning like Apologies or Big White Gate, this is for you.  Gone are songs with meaning, soul, truth, blues, replaced by techno.  I mss the guitar riffs between Scott and Benny. I miss a piano solo like Stars.  I miss a rocker like "ah Mary" or "Stop the Bus".

Amazon review: There are a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation, this album is just as good or better. WHAT?!  If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.  If a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldn't be bluegrass.  When U2 decided to go electronica on their Pop album it sucked.  That's what this is.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to the band through the song "It Doesn't Have To Be This Way" from their self-titled album.  I was hooked.  Then I discovered them in the late '90s when I was a senior at New York University.  They had already released a couple of albums prior to this one (including their self-titled debut), but what made them stand out from other bands in their genre was the way they blended their heavy metal with their pop sensibilities.  This album was basically a compilation of songs from their first three albums with a handful of covers thrown in.  I found this album when I was looking through my music collection and I was surprised to find it was not in a jewel case.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a mix of styles.  It is very pop-oriented but there is a lot of metal.  You will not find any songs that will make you move, you will not find any songs that will make you cry, but you will not find any songs that will make you sing along.  This album is a classic, not a classic that will stand the test of time.  Although you will find songs that you can only imagine hearing in the future, you are unlikely to hear them today.

Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this.

Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

I have a couple of different opinions on this album.  Personally, I think this album is the best that Fratelli has ever put out.  The album is so consistent that it doesn't get boring after a while.  While it is quite different from Fratelli's other albums, it doesn't seem that it would be a stretch to say this album is an extension of Fratelli's other albums.  For example, the album is the first album that Fratelli put out that is completely about him being black.  Other than the fact that this album is a bit darker and a little more dramatic, he doesn't seem to have changed much in his life or his career to have taken this step.  On a similar note, he doesn't seem to have had much of a change in his life to make him take this step.  He seems to have always been a very private person, and this album shows him in a different light.
I also think that this album is a great representation of Fratelli's personality.  There are a couple of tracks that I think show a bit more of his softer side.  The album is also a good representation of his love of music and his love of people.
I think this album would make a great movie.  It would be a bit of a mess, but it would still be a great movie.  The soundtrack would be great on its own, and the movie would be a great movie.  The main storyline would be about Fratelli's love of music.  The other storyline would be about how he is trying to change the world.
The movie would star George Clooney, who would play Fratelli and would be playing the role of Fratelli's love interest, but he would have a different role in the movie.  On the other hand, the main character would be played by John Goodman.   This is because I think that Goodman would be the perfect choice to play the role of a young black man struggling to find his place in a world that has changed so much.
I also want to give a shout out to the song "Love, Will You Miss Me".  It is a great song, and I wish I could have heard it in the movie.
The album would also be great to buy in a box with other Fratelli albums so that you could put it on your shelf for years.
I also want to give a shout out to the song "We Belong" by the Temptations.  This song is a great song that would be a great addition to the movie.
I also want to give a shout out to the song "When She Looked at Me" by the Temptations.  This song is a great song, and I wish I could have heard it in a movie.
The album would also be a great addition to a Fratelli box set for any Fratelli fan that wanted to have a different album in a box set.
I would also give a shout out to the song "I Can't Go Home" by the Temptations.  This song is a great song and would be a great addition to the movie.
The album would also be a great addition to a Fratellite box set for any Fratelli fan that wanted to have a different LP in a box set.
The album would also be a great addition to a Fratello box set for any Fratelli fan.
I also want to give a shout out to the song "You and I" by the Temptations.  This song is a great song.
The album would also be a great addition to a Fratella box set for any Fratelli fan.

You can only have so many albums, and I have to admit that I don't really like albums.  They are just CDs that you can give to your friends to listen to.  I prefer MP3s or audio books, and I don't think that albums are that much better than what you can get out of a CD.  The only thing that I really like about them is that they are just about the same price as the CD.
The album is good, and it is definitely worth the money that you are paying for it.

I was a little skeptical when I first heard this album, but I loved it soo much that I bought it immediately.  I think that it is the best album that Jim has put out since his first album.  It is

Amazon review: I bought this CD about 2 weeks ago and I've listened to it over and over since.  I agree with a lot of the things the reviewer said in his review.  A lot of his criticisms are just due to the fact that the CD is "digital."  I agree with him when he said that he didn't like the fact that the song ends and then begins again.  I would have preferred that it would have just ended!  But other than that, I loved it.  I listened to it all day, and I could not stop listening to it.  I'm not sure if it is really my favorite.

As I listened to the CD, I realized that I really really liked the song.  I really liked the fact that it was about living.  It was interesting to listen to and think about what I needed to do to be happy.  It was also interesting to listen to and think about what I needed to do to be free.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you need any help with the math, think of it like this: the people who like this album are basically in the right ballpark to like this album.  If you are not in the right ballpark you should stop listening.  This album does not have a single track that I can recommend to anyone.

Amazon review: I listened to the album a very long time ago when it was called, The Best of Shinedown.  I was pleasantly surprised with the final product.  I had previously heard songs from their previous albums, but this collection of songs is, on the whole, much more satisfying and enjoyable than the others.  I was disappointed that the album did not include "Bury A Friend" a song I had grown to love, but I was not disappointed that the album was not a greatest hits compilation.  When listening to Shinedown in the past, I have always felt that it was a real improvement over their previous music.  Now, I wish they could go back and re-release one or two of the songs that made me think so highly of their previous work.  I have not heard any of their new material since the release of this album and I am really not sure what to make of it.  I hope that the band is going to release another album in the near future as I think that would be the best way to ensure that they continue to grow and evolve as a band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first heard this album I was kind of expecting something from a cheesy rap/music crossover band.  I had no idea that this would be a truly hard rock album.  The production is pretty standard, but the music is very good.  I would call it "Good" in that it doesn't sound like anything else around.  The vocals are a little thin at times, but they are still very good.  Most of the lyrics are pretty cheesy and the music is a little hard to hear until you really want to hear it.  This is not a really bad album, but it is a little much for my taste.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is about a year old now, but I have not heard it before.  I was surprised at how good this album is.  It is a great album, and the songs are very good.

Amazon review: I have listened to a lot of Shinedown albums and I must admit that I have not heard this one before.  It is very good and I think everyone should check it out.  Overall, this is a really good album.  I have never heard Shinedown sound so good.  It is just really refreshing to hear the band sound so good.  The album is very catchy as well.  I would say that maybe the best song is "I Don't Think So" and the worst song is "Justify Yourself" by the way.  They should have had more songs like that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really disappointed to find out that the band had stopped performing music.  I was so disappointed, I was thinking of writing a Shinedown fan song about them.  I hope they will start performing again soon.  I think that this album has some really great tracks that the band should have released.  I really hope that they will release another album very soon.  The album is very good and I would recommend it.  The lyrics are repetitive but the band makes it fun to listen to and the songs are very catchy.  The production is great.  I think this album is very good, but I'm not going to buy it because the band does not have anything else to offer.

Amazon review: The music is so awesome. I love the orchestra. I love the lyrics and the way they are put together. I love the music.

The star of Bethlehem represents the birth of Jesus. The star is also the star of hope. Hope is needed because there is so much darkness in the world. Hope is needed for all of us. Everyone needs hope. Hope is needed for my family. Hope for my parents. Hope for my children, my husband, my children, my husband. Hope for my friends, my family, my husband. Hope for my animals, my friends, my family. I like this song because I think it is a song about hope. I like how the Bible says that when Jesus came to earth, he did come down to earth to save us.

If you have not bought the original OneRepublic album (Dreaming Out Loud) that has this song on it, you are missing out. I understand Timbaland helped OneRepublic get started, but there is no reason for taking credit for someone else's song.  I feel that Timbaland's contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out. I much prefer the original mix to this version.

I've been listening to AZ since he was in his garage band days.  I saw a show when he was with his new band in the mid 90's and I got a great view of him in between set changes.  He was a young guy, but boy was he an old soul.  His album OneRepublic is excellent.  I would listen to this a lot.  I would put this in my top 10 albums of all time.

Amazon review: Oh for the love of the Lord Jesus, I can't believe I'm about to write this.  I'm not the biggest fan of OneRepublic, they are a "dime a dozen" band to me, but I had to listen to this album.  The song "I'm a Loser" by OneRepublic is by far the best song I've ever heard.  If you need proof, go to the MySpace page of the band, go to their songs, and listen to the song "I'm a Loser" by OneRepublic.  It's my favorite song of all time.  I love how the band delivers the song.  I love how they sound, and that's what I want to hear from my bands.  The best thing about the song is the arrangement by the band.  The song "I'm a Loser" by OneRepublic was written to sound like one of those "hit songs" you hear on the radio.
