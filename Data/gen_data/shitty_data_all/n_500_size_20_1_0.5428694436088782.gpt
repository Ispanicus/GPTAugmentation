Amazon review : There are a couple of things that make this album great.  First is the simplicity of the songs.  They are all very very simple.  They are not overly complicated.  They are not intricate.  They are just simple and very memorable.  The second thing I really like is that Al's singing is so good.  The way she sings is very unique.  It is very different from the way most singers sing.  Her voice is very different.  It has a very unique and different sound.  The last thing I like about this album is that Al's voice is so very good.  I really enjoy his singing.  I just really love his singing.  There is not much else I can say about this album.  Its a very good album.  I don't expect this to be another one of Al's best albums.  But there is nothing negative about this album.  It is a very good album.  I highly recommend this album.  I think its excellent.

It looks like a old photo album.  I mean it looks like a photo album that someone took at a thrift shop.  The only thing it has going for it is the quality of the photos inside.  But that's not a good reason to buy a cheap album.  I have listened to this album several times and I just can't stand it.  I just can't stand the album.  Its not very good.  I am not sure if this is an album Al should have made.  I don't know if Al should have made a great album like this or a bad album like this.  I just don't know.  I am not sure I like this album.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have to say that this is an amazing product. With Fibromyalgia, the body is basically a constant battle for survival. Once your body is exposed to stress, your body will take a fight or flight response. This response is very similar to the human body's reaction to fight or flight in a physical battle. In the fight or flight response, the body will secrete chemicals that act like a "stress hormone" called cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands. These stress hormones are not only produced in the adrenal glands but also throughout the body to maintain and regulate homeostasis.
The problem is, if your body is constantly exposed to stress in any way, even in a small way, your body begins to produce stress hormones because of the fear or stress that is being generated. Stress hormones increase cortisol production. Cortisol, as you may know, acts like a "fight or flight" hormone. Cortisol increases heart rate and blood pressure, and causes your lungs to fill with fluid. Cortisol also causes your body to secrete chemicals called pro-inflammatory compounds, which are called cytokines. Cytokines are a group of chemicals that inhibit the production of other compounds that are needed in order to help the body repair itself and fight infection.
When the body is exposed to stress continually, it will start producing more and more of these chemicals. They will also cause the brain and the nervous system to react in a "fight or flight" type of reaction. The main problem with this is that this type of stress reaction will not stop. Stress hormones will just build up and eventually become a major problem. This is what we are talking about when we talk about stress and anxiety. Stress hormones will not go away. So we know that it is important to help our bodies manage stress.
As you can see, we can manage stress and anxiety using different tools and techniques. The only problem is that fibromyalgia will not be dealt with by a single tool or technique. We need to do an all natural approach, which is why a combination of the following approaches is used in the program:
1. Nutritional approach (using herbs and foods that help the body process and eliminate the stress hormones)
2. Lifestyle approach (using tools that make you feel better in order to help the body manage stress)
3. Mind and body approach (using tools that help our brains and bodies to manage stress)
4. Cognitive approach (using tools that help our brains to manage stress)
5. Emotional approach (using tools that help us to manage our emotions)
When you look at the whole picture, when you look at the entire picture, which includes all the tools, this is what happens:
1. The body produces more stress hormones.
2. The chemical response by the body is a fight or flight response that will cause your heart rate to increase, your blood pressure to rise, your lungs to fill with fluid, and your body will secrete chemicals that will cause your body to secrete chemicals called

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I was surprised by the quality of this CD. It sounded great when played through my D-15's. However, after listening to it on my Yamaha CX-3, I was very disappointed with the sound quality. To put it bluntly, this disc sounded like a cassette tape.

Amazon review: I have to say that I'm really disappointed with this CD. The problem is that I'm expecting something from another country.

Amazon review: I am an American living in Australia. I wanted to get a copy of this album. I liked the American version and thought it sounded great. However, I can't believe I've spent more than $3.00 to have a copy of this CD that sounds like a tape. I know this is a problem with the Australian mastering, but it seems that the CD is just a tape. The vocals are clear and crisp, but the instruments don't sound like they do in the original album. The guitars in particular are very high pitched and do not sound like they are playing the guitar in my car. I've checked with other people who have heard this album and they have heard many complaints like this. I'm going to keep searching for another copy of this album to get the original sound.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album on several different CD players and when I listen to it on my CD player then the sound is great! But when I listen to it on my Sony Discovox CD player, the sound is not as good as my CD player. The sound on my CD player is great, but the sound on my Sony is not. I will give this album another try, but it is not worth the money for me. I think the CD was a little overpriced for what it really is.

Amazon review: I was so excited when I found this CD. I absolutely love this album. I have listened to it on many different CD players and the sound quality is just amazing. However, that is until I purchased the CD and realized that the sound quality is only for a CD player. I purchased the CD expecting it to sound better on a CD player. Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't even close to what is on the CD. I'm very disappointed with this album. I wish I would've purchased the album in a different format.

Amazon review: I was really surprised by how this CD sounded. For the first time in my life, I had the pleasure of listening to a band from another country. This band sounded like an American band but not. They sound like a band from an alternative country. The vocals are very strong and the songs are very catchy. I am not a big fan of pop music but I love this CD. I am really surprised by the CD's sound quality. This is my second CD that I have purchased from Amazon and I will be purchasing more once I have a few more on hand.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I was a little disappointed this is just a story book, but it was pretty good.  I think the story would be much more interesting if the voices of the characters came from the show rather than the book.  One of the characters was named Susan Boyle in the book and she also makes an appearance on the show.  The book isn't a picture book so it's hard to read but I thought it was a good read.  I also thought the book would be better if I could change the voices.

Amazon review: Susan Boyle is so nice to listen to that I felt like crying.  When I was a kid I loved her so much I was always singing the song "I Dreamed a Dream".

It was very boring, but I liked it.  It has a good story line.  I would recommend the book to anyone who would like to know more about Susan Boyle.

Amazon review: Susan Boyle seems to be a wonderful and happy person.  I think people should listen to her.

It is so hard to understand why people are so cruel to her.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of M.J.'s music.  I know he has a lot of fans, and I'm one of them.  However, his last cd I have is a bit dated.  I'm not sure how exactly to describe it.  It's a "feel good" cd.  The music is very groovy, but there is nothing in it that I like.  I thought he was just going through the motions with this release, but I guess not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this song is just another example of what a boring artist is.  The song is very repetitive....too much buildup and the music is too loud.  I would give this a minus...
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best version of the song I've heard.  The version on the cd is a bit too loud and the lyrics are also a bit off.  I like the song and want to hear the full song.  The cd version is a very good version of the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the music and the lyrics, but I don't know that it's worth the money!  The song is a bit too much.  The music is nice, but you can hear the lyrics in the background.  I'm a little disappointed and will probably pass on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As I listened to this song, it reminded me of a song I heard from my teenage years.  It's about a girl I used to know who lived in our town.  I like the song with the lyrics.  I don't know what this song is, but it sounds like a good one.  I'm a fan of M.J.'s and would definitely recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this cd several times in the past.  I am not impressed.  It's a good song, but there is nothing special about it.  The cd is great, but the song is a let down.  I have listened to them all.

Amazon review: I am getting a lot of negative feedback for this cd.  If you like techno, it probably won't be for you.  If you are a fan of techno, it probably won't be for you.  The music is fine.  The lyrics are alright.  I would not recommend this song to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the cd and have listened to it a few times.  It is a very good song.  The lyrics are good.  The music is good.  The only time I was really bored was when the song came to an end.  The song is a good one.

Amazon review: This is the worst song MJ has released yet.  I bought this cd numerous times in the past and have listened to it a few times.  The cd is good.  The music is good.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing I liked about this album is that it's got some sort of a cool and fresh sound. The only thing I didn't like about it was the lack of any sense of danger, which I found to be the most essential part of The Killers sound.

Amazon review: The Killers new album is OK but not what I was expecting. I was expecting something with a bit more energy and a little more edge. The vocal lines were a bit much for my taste though. I did like the songs that were on the album though, I just wish they were a little more memorable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The Killarney record was a huge disappointment. We all expect this record to be a great one. We all want new and unique music.  For the most part, this record was the same sort of sound as the last Killers record.  The vocals were really bad and the songs were all the same.  What's the use of another song with the same title to fill out the album?  The song selections were very bland and not memorable.  The only good song was "We're Not Gonna Take It".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was the first one I ever bought. I was so excited. I bought this album and went to listen to it and found out it was terrible. I didn't like it and threw it away.

I listened to it the same amount of times I listened to Killers album.  I still don't like it.  I find it not to be a very good record.  The songs are okay.  They are average at best.

Amazon review: Love the work wish the CD had more Tracks!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: I bought this CD so I would hear the song that started it all. I must say I am disappointed. I am not a blues fan and this song is not one they play here in my area. I'm looking forward to the next one though.

Amazon review: I'm a huge rock fan and I've been buying albums for the last 4 months. I've been waiting to hear this one for a while. I'm happy to report that I've been disappointed! It's terrible! It's one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I'm not a huge blues fan either, so I'm disappointed that I've wasted money on this one. I'm not a huge punk fan either, so I'm disappointed that I've wasted money on this album. I could go on and on, but I won't. I'll try to remember to stay away from this one.

Amazon review: I bought a few different CDs for my son. I was very pleased with the performances at least. The lyrics, however, were not as good as I would have liked. I know that there is no way that the artist could have possibly written the lyrics to this song. I can't help but wonder if the person who wrote the lyrics is going to be upset at the way they were performed. I will have to give this one a negative review because the performance was not up to par.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought some of the albums and I really like them. I bought this one so I would buy all of them. I'm sorry I didn't enjoy this album. It was not even enjoyable. It was nothing! The worst album I've ever heard. I won't be buying any more CD's from Amazon.

Amazon review: I picked this CD up on a whim. I was really excited to see what it'd be like. I was pretty disappointed. This guy is just a joke. He's a joke! This guy is a joke! He has no talent. He doesn't sing! He doesn't rock! He's just a joke! No talent! I'm done buying his albums. I'm done buying his CDs. I'm done buying anything from this guy.

Amazon review: I'm so happy I bought this album. I'm glad that I went to the store when I did because I found out the CD was not a great value for the money. I was disappointed. I didn't buy it for its music. I bought it for the cover. The cover was nice. I thought it was a nice album cover. The music was terrible. There was no way the artist could have written the lyrics to this. This is a horrible album. I'm sorry I bought it. I'm sorry I bought it. I was so disappointed that I didn't buy this album for the music. I bought it for the cover.

Amazon review: I love this album. I didn't mind the songs or the way the lyrics were written or sung, but the artwork was not something I'd buy on my own.

Amazon review: This album, along with most of the best albums from the 90's was a pain in the neck to buy. I've loved most of the albums released in the last 10 years but I'm not sure I'd buy another from this band. The music is wonderful and the lyrics are great but the artwork is cheesy. I'm not sure I'd buy another from them. I'm glad I bought the CD for the cover. The CD sounded great. The music was great. The lyrics were very good. The artwork wasn't anything special. I gave this album 3 stars for the CD and 2 stars
