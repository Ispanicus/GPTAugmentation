Amazon review: "The song is so catchy and fun that it will have you singing along, and even if you don't like it, I have to agree with you.  This is a great song, the song was written by a great lyricist and musician, and as a songwriter, I can't imagine anyone better.  This song is a classic.  I know it's been around since a long time ago, but I just had to get it on here.  It's catchy and fun.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have never seen this before and it is a fun band to listen to. My favorite songs are "The Man Who Fell to Earth," "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me," "The Last Song," "The Song's the Same," and "I'll Be There for You." And then there are the non-lyrical songs, "My Father's Eyes," "I've Been Down This Road Before," and the "I'm a Little Teapot" song from "The Man Who Fell to Earth." What makes this CD special is that it also has songs from the "Music From Big Pink," "The Lion King," "The Little Mermaid," and "Aladdin," which are some of my favorite Disney songs, but I do like the songs from "The Jungle Book," and "Hercules," which I have listened to a few times. I have also heard this CD a few times and it is fun. I think people who enjoy Jewel, I would recommend this CD to them. I have only listened to this CD twice, but I don't think I will be buying again. This is a fun release.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not only is Lin Manuel Miranda the greatest lyricist since Shakespeare, but he is also a master conductor. This collection of songs from his work on the Broadway hit Hamilton is an essential introduction to the musicals of the current era. Lin Manuel Miranda is a true showman and his work in Hamilton is a testament to his ability to interpret the music of George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Stephen Sondheim, and Richard Rodgers.  
This CD is a must for every Hamilton fan.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway career has been nothing short of impressive. He has scored numerous hit songs with the likes of Hamilton, Wicked, and On the Twentieth Century. Now Lin Manuel Miranda has released his very first Broadway album: Lin Manuel Miranda: Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway Album (Amazon). This album features the hits from Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway musicals: Hamilton, Rent, and Hamilton: An American Musical. Lin Manuel Miranda: Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway Album features such hits as "A Night on the Town", "This is How We Roll", "All of Me", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "All of Me", "A Part of Me", "Take a Bow", "I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby", "The Next Big Thing", "The Next Big Thing (Reprise)", "Somewhere Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea", "You're Never Fully Dressed", "I Can't Make You Love Me", "Rent", "I've Gotta Feeling", "No One Ever Dies in the Sunshine", and "Tonight Will Be Different". Lin Manuel Miranda: Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway Album also features the Broadway show-stopper "On the Town" which is also included on Lin Manuel Miranda's Lin Manuel Miranda's Greatest Hits: A Musical Tourist's Guide to Broadway, released in 2011. Finally, Lin Manuel Miranda: Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway Album features the hit single "This Is How We Roll" which has been featured in the films Step Up: All In, Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3: All In, and Step Up 4: The Streets. Lin Manuel Miranda: Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway Album is the first Broadway album released by Lin Manuel Miranda.

Amazon review: The music from Hamilton is amazing. The lyrics are great and are the best thing about this show. The only thing I don't like is that at the end of the album is a song called "Lovely Day". It is a song about Hamilton's love of Hamilton and Hamilton's love of love. Lin Manuel Miranda isn't that kind of singer. He is a beautiful and talented singer. As a man of great skill and talent he should be doing more, not less. He is a great singer and that is what makes Hamilton great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Lin Manuel is great at what he does. He's a great lyricist. He's an excellent songwriter. I was really impressed with his writing on the Hamilton, Rent, and Hamilton: An American Musical albums. I think this is one of his strongest recordings yet.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is definitely the best album of Lin Manuel's Broadway career. The songs on this album are so good and so varied that you don't have to be a Hamilton fan to enjoy them. Most of his albums have been a bit too predictable as far as the style is concerned, but this album is a lot more unpredictable. It's a little bit different from the other Lin Manuel Miranda albums. The songs that he has done that were more expected are the more memorable.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Lin Manuel's songs are so good! I didn't know that he could write songs. He really is on another level. I really can't imagine how he did Hamilton until I heard it. The songs are so amazing that you have to listen to the songs. I've seen the show, but never heard the music. I would have to go see it to really appreciate the songs. I really recommend this album to all Lin Manuel Miranda fans.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Lin Manuel and Lin Manuel Miranda are two of the greatest singers out there. The songs are so well written and so easy to sing along with. I bought this album in hopes that Lin Manuel would write something that was not just a re-recording of a Hamilton song, but would actually show some originality

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing it for the first time, I immediately bought it.  The first song that I heard was "My Favorite Things". I was amazed at the way her voice sang through the entire song.  It was a very emotional song, and it made me cry.  Then I went on to the second CD, "The First Time I Saw Your Face".  When I listened to the songs I thought they sounded very different.  I then went on to the third CD, "So Glad I Found You Again".  They were very different songs. I like the way she sings the songs, and the emotions that come out of them.  The songs are very beautiful.

Amazon review:  I have been searching for a new CD to listen to.  I have found a CD that I want to listen to.  The songs on this CD are so beautiful that they will make you feel good.  They are all written by a female that has come to the realization that she is not her father.  So she has tried to live her life how her father would have wanted her to live it, but she has found that her life is completely different.  She has tried to fit in with the rest of the world, but she can't.  This is an album that will make you feel good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to a female who has come to the realization that she is not her father.

Amazon review: This is an inspiring collection of very beautiful, very heartfelt and very moving songs.  I am so happy that I found this CD.  I have listened to it over and over again and I never tire of it.  The music has a very special and intimate quality to it that makes listening to it very special.  The music is different from the other CDs that I have listened to.  It is not too loud, it is not too soft, it is not too fast, and it is not too slow.  It is just the right amount, and it is really lovely. If you listen to this CD, you will not only be touched by the beauty of the songs, but you will also be touched by the emotional quality that is placed into the songs by their author.  I would like to ask the author of the songs to come and visit us in our little town.  She would love it!

I have been enjoying the songs, but I have to say that I am also enjoying the orchestration of the songs and the wonderful melody of the lyrics.  Some of the songs will make you cry, some of the songs will make you smile, some of the songs will make you dance, and some of the songs will make you want to sing.  I think that Lin Manuel Miranda is the most talented musician on this planet, and

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: This is a very good album. I just purchased it for my son from Amazon and I'm very much looking forward to listening to it.

Amazon review: I bought the 1st CD of this opera several years ago and I still love it. I thought I had lost it. I found it on a "deal" for $16.99 at Costco.

Amazon review: I bought it on sale and paid $15.95 for it and it was a great album, but I feel it could have been a whole lot better and would have been better if it had been a little more expensive. It has some good tracks (some of which I really like) but it is a little weak on the rest.

Amazon review: I have had a lot of problems with my Amazon purchases. I have had four in the last two weeks. The first one was a CD that I bought for $15.00. It was a beautiful and amazing CD. The second one was a CD I bought for $15.00 that the seller gave to me with the rest of his CDs. When I got the CD in the mail I was quite happy. When I opened the package I was not happy. The CD was a dirty, stained, and torn mess. After a little research I found that it was the seller's CD that had been used twice and was not new. The third purchase was a CD I bought for my husband. He has had a lot of problems with his Amazon

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: A good start to a great album  This is a classic western with an acoustic guitarist and two excellent vocals.  The songs have a great musicality and flow and are very interesting.  Some may even find this album difficult to listen to because of the strong vocals and some of the instrumentation.  This album is worth a listen if you enjoy the classic western genre.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After hearing this album for the first time, I thought it was a really good album.  The only problem is that it's all very similar and it's difficult to tell which songs are which.  I love the way that they are going to start a new album on a positive note and then end it with a negative one.  In fact, the only thing that I don't like about the album is that they don't seem to be able to find the good way to end the album.  I loved the songs and the musicianship, but I would have preferred to hear a little more variety in the album.  So if you like the way that they are going to start this album positively and then end it negatively, then you have a good album on your hands.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to a few different versions of this album and each one is good.  The songs are all different and a little bit different, but they are all good.

Amazon review: I am not going to give you a five star rating because I think they are boring, but I will give them 4 because they are so good.  But, I think they need to change something.  I think they need to get their sound more like the other pop groups that are on the radio and TV, and stop changing so much.  I don't know what their problem is, but I think they need to stop trying to be different.  I think they need to stick to one thing and stick with it.  It is so boring.  I don't know what they should do.

Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: One of the greatest bands ever - and they never did anything more than play a few one-hit songs.  I was a fan for a few years but I'm a fan of the new stuff and this band is fantastic.  I think they are better than the original band.  No one else has given them a run for their money yet.  I'm so disappointed in them.  I mean, they could have been huge if they had their act together.  They are a band of the past that are now a band of the future.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for this album for a long time. I was excited to get the album and then Twiztid comes out with what is supposed to be a "new" sound.  I have listened to a lot of Twiztid and this album is not the best.  The vocals are terrible and the lyrics are lame.  I love the group and I love the rest of the album.  The only thing I can say is that I am more excited to go to a Twiztid concert and listen to the real Twiztid.

Amazon review: There are some good songs on this album but it is really just the typical hard core rap.  But you have to respect the lyrical content.  There were some songs that made me cry.  My first listen to this album was with the radio on at night.  I was listening to the radio and I heard the song "Sugar Daddy", I was so excited, I thought it was the new songs by Twiztid.  Then I heard a song called "It's Like that" and I was so mad.  Then I heard a song called "I'm From Atlanta" and I was so mad.  This song was my favorite, I loved the chorus of that song.  I have to say I will probably not buy this album again.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

MUSIC:

I bought this CD as a gift for my mother-in-law who loves to sing.

I like the song but the CD was not a complete release.

I like the singer, but the music sounds like someone else that I have heard before.

I like the songs but I do not like that I can not get an answer as to who sings what. I was told that the artist has moved to another country and that I have not heard this artist in over 20 years.

Amazon review: This Is The Newest Single From David Lee Roth/Eddie Money/Nashville. Its the first single from the newly released album "The Last Don't Know What To Do"
This Is The Newest Single From David Lee Roth/Eddie Money

It all started when I saw "Love Is Here To Stay" on the radio. I just couldn't wait to buy a CD so I could hear it. The song was so much better than the actual artist that I just could not stand to listen to the artist that is out there. 

So I bought the CD. I listened to it. I went to the show and was disappointed. But I did not buy another CD.

The song was good, but I did not want to listen to the artist. I was even more disappointed when The Artist is no longer with us. I just want to hear the artist that is out there.

But, I am sure that I will get another CD. If not, I will give the money back. I will go to a show and buy the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I have been listening to these guys for years now and I have to say, I am very impressed. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Every member of the band has a unique sound and personality.  I am a fan of the late, great, Clint Eastwood.  He always pushed the idea that westerns should not be about guns and gunslinger antics, but more about the people and the everyday hardships that they faced.  In my opinion, Hall and Oat's music is very much in that tradition.  I like Clint, but I must admit that I am more of a Clint Eastwood fan than a Hall and Oat fan.  However, this album has a lot of great music on it and I am a big fan of the song "Gunfighter."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD's name is "Suspended" and I am on the second pressing, so I have heard the songs a few times.  I will say that this CD does have some catchy tunes but I just have a hard time relating to them.  The songs are actually quite simple.  I guess if you want a danceable song you have to dance to it.  I wish I had more patience.  This CD is not going to be my favorite of the year.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD has some really good songs and the vocals are great.  This CD is a great addition to my library of CD's.  While I am not completely sold on this CD, I think it is worth the money for the CD's and I will be looking into buying more of Cyney Davis' CDs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is a great addition to my CD collection.  I really liked the songs on this CD and will purchase more of her CDs.  I think this CD does not deserve a five star rating because the style is different and there are several songs that are very repetitive, but the vocals are really good.  I think she should have a more varied sound because the songs are repetitive.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't believe this music is my parents' favorite, but I guess I should get over that.  This CD is not for me.  I just can't get into the songs.  I do like the harmonies but I am not really into this style of singing.  I am not a good singer, so I can't sing in the higher registers.  The vocals are decent but I would rather just listen to good quality music.

Amazon review: I have only heard the songs in this CD once and I really like them.  I am not a fan of this style of singing, which to me is not the same thing as bad singing.  I do like the album and the songs, but I am just not a fan of this style of singing. I think the album and the songs are good and I know the next CD has more songs, but I am not buying this CD.  I don't understand why people would pay $10 for a CD that they can't even hear.  I don't know why people go to see this artist.  It just seems like such a waste of money, especially when the money could be used for something else.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

But here's the summary:

This is a great song that was used in a movie.  The song is called "Tuxedo Junction".  I don't have a copy, or I don't think I have one, but I know it goes something like this:

I was sitting in my room at the time, and there on my stereo, was a single song that I thought was the most beautiful song I had ever heard.  It was this song, and the lyrics were the most beautiful thing

Amazon review: The first song on Amazon and in my opinion, a gem.  I have been able to find it in a secondhand store, so it must exist some place.  The song is a "hit" in my mind, as I have had friends play this song in a band.  I have tried to find it on a CD player, but it was not possible.  I even tried to find it on YouTube and I couldn't.  Then I got a song, but it was not a "hit" in my mind.  There are some "hits" out there on YouTube, but they don't carry the song that I have found.  I don't know what it is about this song that makes it so "hit" in my mind.  I can find songs that I have heard all my life on YouTube, and I know what they sound like.  But this song is different, and I have no idea why.  The lyrics on this song are wonderful.  I have been searching for something like this all my life.  No one is ever going to find it.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the Hall & Oats.  This has been a part of my life for over 30 years.  I bought it in the 1980's after a friend told me that it was a Hall & Oats song.  I had always wanted the song to be a Hall & Oats song.  I was looking for it because I was looking for a song that was from the "classic" era.  I was looking for it because I felt that it was a Hall & Oats song.  I had a cd player, but I do not know how I came across the song.  I bought the cd in a used store in San Diego, California.  The song was not available on Amazon, so I bought it on Amazon.  I was not disappointed.  This song is my all time favorite Hall & Oats song.  I like to listen to it on a slow, easy pace.  It is a slow song, but it is so enjoyable.  It is simple, but it is also catchy.  I just love songs like this.  I always have a song on my iPod that I listen to all the time.  I have a lot of songs that I play on an iPod, but I never listen to the lyrics.  When I listen to this song on an iPod, I just listen to the music.  I don't listen to the words.
