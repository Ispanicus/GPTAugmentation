Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: The Music of the Grateful Dead from their official website:
"This is the official soundtrack of the Grateful Dead.
All the songs on this album were recorded in February of 1995 and are intended to document the last shows played by the Grateful Dead during their final tour in support of their album, 'Touch of Grey.'"
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There's a reason they're called the Grateful Dead. It's not just because of the music, it's also the name of a band, the Dead, that's so huge and influential that it's impossible not to notice their influence on every band and every genre of music. Most of them are the same band, but the influence is strong and undeniable. There's no way to explain these guys without mentioning their influence, and that's exactly why you're gonna want to grab a copy of this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The Grateful Dead are one of the most influential bands of all time. They were an American band that reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s and 1980s. They were a rock and roll band that played in a variety of styles and was one of the first to use live instrumentation in their live shows. Their first album, 'armac', was released in 1971 under name of the Acoustic Band. It was recorded in the spring of 1971 in a small studio in a small town in New York. The Dead's second album, 'Eyes of the World', was released in 1972, and it was recorded in a small studio in a small town in New York. The Dead was then known as the Grateful Dead and their influence is apparent in the music that was created and the bands that followed them.

Amazon review: The stars say it all, don't know what else I could put other than I love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

###
Amazon review: I've never been so bored.  This was a nice little movie to watch, but I was totally bored.  The sound was too loud and the quality of the video wasn't up to par.  I was not disappointed by the video, mind you.  The sound was much worse.  I had a hard time keeping the subtitles in, and the audio seemed to have a really hard time keeping up with the video.  This is the first time I've had to use a USB cable to watch a movie on my computer, and I did not like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this movie to be an almost perfect example of how people can actually watch other people's movies.  I would encourage people to watch it...but I think it's better to let it sink into your mind like a great film.  I found it to be very disappointing.  There was no story.  It was just mindless, meaningless, and dull.  It's just a horrible movie.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had a lot of fun watching this movie and it did seem like an interesting exercise for my brain.  The whole thing was a little confusing.

Amazon review: This is a very entertaining movie and it has a lot of good things to say about the world we live in.  That's the only thing I can say on the negative side.

Amazon review: This is an upbeat song that is one of my favourite ones and a song I like to listen to when I am really down and not feeling very good. The song is about a girl who is going through a hard time in her life and has a strong need to have a good time. The chorus is very interesting, the chorus is very much like a rock version of the original "I Can't Help Myself" and the song is really fun and energetic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A song that I am sure everyone knows about. The story is told in a very short and interesting way, with a very simple chord structure.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: You Can't Always Get What You Want - this album is just ok. I know the band is from the UK, but I doubt they've ever been to the USA.  It sounds like they are just trying to copy the American sound, and I don't think it is working. The music is a little too loud and there are too many re-recorded songs. Not a good effort by any means, but they have a nice sound, and the songs are well worked out and interesting.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: It's still a great album, but most definitely not worth the money anymore.  I've been there and done that.  But, I could listen to this album all day and be happy with it, because it's not the same album.  (I don't mind the "I'm Sorry" section, because it was a song that reminded me of my friend.)  But, the rest of the album just makes me want to scream at my computer screen and do something stupid.  I give this album only 1/4 out of 10 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing better than "I'm Sorry" is "All by Myself."  But, again, that just doesn't make the album.  That song is just a boring, inoffensive, and uninspired cover of an obscure song.  I could not be bothered to listen to this album all the way through.  I'm more of a Johnny Cash guy than a Garfunkel guy, so the whole "All by Myself" thing just irritates me.

Amazon review: I don't know if I have to say what I think.  This album is boring.  It's just a collection of songs you can't possibly stand to listen to, and they're all covered with different people's voices, and it takes you out of the song that you're listening to, and you start telling yourself that this is just a bunch of crappy music.  I give this album only 1/4 out of 10 stars, and I'm sorry, because I was really excited about this album.  I wish I could give you more.  I give this album only 1/4 out of 10 stars and I'm sorry.

I give this album only 1/4 out of 10 stars because it was just average.

Amazon review: Here's a great album that is not as good as the other ones.  It's not as good for being one of the greatest albums of all time.  I don't care about how it's written.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

I agree with many of the other reviews on this (I have bought, and enjoyed, the earlier albums) but this song is the one thing that I can't quite put my finger on - it is a little annoying, but then it is just as annoying when I listen to it without the chorus. Just a minor annoyance, but I can't help feeling that there is something off about this song and therefore I am not as happy as the rest of you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This has been a year of surprises. And I am still not happy. I don't know what it is about this song that makes me hate it. I like the song a lot. I've listened to it at least 100 times. But it's just not for me. It's okay, I guess. I like it. It's a little rough around the edges, but the vocals are still okay. The chorus is okay, too. It's the verses that I don't like. I can't describe it, but it doesn't sound like a happy song. But it is, in a way. And that is what makes it annoying me. I don't like happy songs. And I don't like song that doesn't sound happy. That's not me. I'm not a happy person, even though I know that I should be. I'm not going to complain about this song. I have already complained about it a couple of times. But I don't have to. I should just let it go. But I can't. It is still bothering me.

Amazon review: I love this song. I love this song, it's just the chorus that bugs me. I don't care for the chorus. It sounds like she's singing about a man who has cheated on her. I can't stand it. I don't love this song. It's the song so far that I have been most disappointed in because it's the one song that I have been waiting for from her. I have been waiting for a song that says "I am sorry I love you" and this is not it.

Amazon review: I love the first few songs on this CD. I have listened to the CD over and over. But this song is just not for me. I don't care for this song, it's the song that I have been waiting since the very first time she did an acoustic version of this song. The one song that I have been waiting for from her for a long time. I wish that she would have released this song a few years ago, but I guess I was just in a bad mood, because I waited for it. And, I am still waiting.

Amazon review: This album is great.  I don't know what happened.  I put the CD in, turned it on, and it wasn't playing.  I played it in all of my CD players.  Nothing.  I did the same thing with other CDs.  I then asked in the Amazon Customer Service form what was wrong with the disc (I have an Audible.com account).  I got a response saying that there was no problem with the CD.  My Amazon account was then deactivated.  I called again.  This time I got someone who said that Amazon was investigating the problem and it would be coming soon.  I was told the CD was defective.  Again I called and got another response that the problem was fixed.  I was told I should give the music a spin.  I did and it played fine.  I was then told that the problem was fixed, and the music would be playing again.  I was told that the defective music would be returned to me.  I asked again for a replacement CD, and was told that I could not have one because the defective one was no longer available.

You can tell that you are listening to a different person.  I really like the song "I'm in Love."  I don't know why they put the word "love" in the song title.  I don't understand the song but it is very nice.  I can't wait to listen to the new CD.

My only problem with this CD is that the lyrics to some of the songs are not very good.  Some of them are too wordy, some of them are not very good, and some of them are just plain wrong.  It is just all over the place and it is not very good.  I mean, some of the songs on this CD are good, but they just are not very good.  I know that it's just the kind of stuff that I normally wouldn't like, I mean, I like Christian music, but this is just not for me.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album twice and still have the same feelings as the first time. The music is the same and the vocals are the same but there have been some changes that are not good.  I really hope that Pink is not going to release another "Anarchy In The UK" type album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album for Pink Floyd fans who like good music.  Its songs are good but the album is not good.  The lyrics are the same as the other Floyd albums but they are not good at all.  I was expecting a much different album but the music was the same.  I am not a Floyd fan and I did not like this album.  The lyrics were not good.  I hope Pink Floyd will release a new album and a new album is released in the future.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since the very beginning.  I have seen them on tour all over the world and have seen them in concert on many occasions.  I have seen them live 3 times.  I have seen every single show and I have seen them on each tour.  I like them and I like their music.  I am a fan of them and I will always be a fan of them.  This album is very disappointing.  I have listened to this album once and I will never listen to it again.  I was very disappointed.  I was expecting something different.  I am not a Floyd fan and I am not a fan of much of the music that Pink Floyd has created.  I just wish they would release a new album.

Amazon review: This is a good album but it is not an album that I will listen to again.  I have been enjoying the music of Pink Floyd for a long time and I really want to like this new album.  I really liked "The Wall" and I really liked "The Dark Side of the Moon" and I also liked "The Wall" and "Shine On You Crazy Diamond".  I really liked these albums and I want to like this album.  I am not a fan of the music that Pink Floyd has created but I really liked this album.  For me this album is just the same songs but I hear some new instruments and a few new songs that are not on the album.  This is not a good album.  I think I will not buy it again.

Amazon review: This album isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I liked the first half of this album but I didn't like the second half.  In the middle of the album it sounded like they were going to break up.  I listened to this album 3 times and I still don't believe that Pink Floyd have been broken up.  I think I could listen to this album all day.  I like the music that Pink Floyd has created.  I like the music but I don't like the album.  I will not purchase it.
