Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: This is a great album. It's more of a modern day hip hop album than I expected. There are a few different styles, but most of them are very good.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I have a lot more to say about this album, I'm afraid, but I'll be damned if I can get all that out of one review.  So, I'll just say in general that I am very pleased with the sound quality of the CD, and the presentation of the music.  I also appreciate the booklet that came with the CD, and the liner notes by Jeff Mangum.  The song selection was very good, and the album was very well put together, from the cover to the liner notes.  The songs were all very good, and the sound quality of the CD was excellent.  The album has some of my favorite material on it, and also some of my least favorite.  I don't have it, I didn't order it, I didn't buy it, I didn't want it, I didn't know it existed.  I just wanted to say that I am very pleased with it, and I also don't want to take my review away from the album as a whole.  I do have one complaint, I think, and that is that at times, on the second CD, you can hear a little bit of distortion.  I have no idea what was done to it, but I just think it's a little noisy.  I don't know if it was the disc, or just the cd player.  But, I do appreciate all the work that has gone into this album, and I will probably order the other two CDs.

Amazon review: I love the film and I love Kevin Spacey, but I have to say that he should have never been cast in this role.  I have seen this movie three times, and every time I see it I think to myself that I wish he could have stayed in his character.  Why was he even cast?  I think that the acting by John Travolta was just not up to par.  I have to take issue with the song selection, they all seemed to me to be filler, and didn't even make the cut.  I'd say that the weakest song on the album, and one that I don't see the appeal of, is "You Must Be Crazy" by Hashtag.  I have to say though, that the album is very well produced, and has a nice overall sound and feel to it.  I think that it's just not as good as the movie it's based on.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While I have often lamented the lack of quality in the "official" soundtrack to the film, this album is a great improvement.  And while I have not been able to hear the other "soundtracks" that are available, they should be coming soon.

Amazon review:  The DVD looks great.  The audio is also very nice.  The film is enjoyable and the score is great.  I just wish that the soundtrack was a little bit longer.  I would have liked to hear more of the songs.  I will purchase the DVD when it's available for sale.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Lenny Kravitz

Friday, January 15, 2014

I'm writing this review on a laptop. I had been waiting patiently for months for my order to arrive.

I was very unhappy with some things I ordered from Amazon. I'm not going to elaborate as I don't want to upset too many people.

I received the Lenny Kravitz album yesterday. In fact, it arrived at the exact same time that I ordered it. I'm so disappointed I ordered it from iTunes.

It was only after reading all of the negative reviews that I realized that this is probably the most poorly written album that I've ever ordered online.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I think this is where I started to really become a fan of Kelly Clarkson and her music - I started listening to her on and off because she was in "the Kelly Clarkson" category.  I guess I got to know her before I really started liking her as an artist, but I think this is where my initial impression of her started to change.  Her voice has grown on me and I'm really enjoying her singing - but this album is not her best work.  It is a good listen, but not her best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Just in case it's not apparent enough, this is Kelly Clarkson.  I do know who this is, in case anyone is wondering!  She's not a "star", but she is a talented musician and entertainer, which is more than most people in popular music can say.  It's a good album regardless, but I think there's more to Kelly Clarkson than that.  I'll admit that I was really looking forward to this album, but for me the biggest problem with it is that I don't particularly like Kelly Clarkson.  I like the rest of her music, but this really is a waste of my time.  I don't think she knows what kind of artist she is.  I don't think she's a great singer and I don't think she's a great performer, but I really like her ability to entertain people with her "song" writing.  She has this ability to make people laugh out loud with her material.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this album.  I really love Kelly Clarkson.  I love her voice and her singing ability.  I love how she sings her own material.  I love how she makes you feel better after listening to a song because she's done it.  She can make you laugh, she can make you cry.  She's a great singer that should have more songs.  I think this is where I started to really get into Kelly Clarkson.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A pretty decent album by a pretty decent singer/songwriter.  She's very talented.  I'm not a huge fan of her singing style, but I do think she's talented.  I like the songs that she does sing.  I like the music that she does sing in this album.  I think she's a good singer, and I think she's a good song writer.  That's all I can really think of.  I think I liked the songs she sang in "It's All About Me".

Amazon review: This is the Kelly Clarkson album of my life!  I have been a fan of her for as long as I can remember.  I have been listening to her music non-stop since I was in primary school.  My favourite album of hers is "Breakaway" (I think it's the second album on the list).  She was nominated for the Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Heartbeat Song" but lost to Mariah Carey.  I don't know why, but "Heartbeat Song" means more to me than Mariah Carey and her "Vision of Love".  I really liked "Breakaway", but it's not really on the list of my favourite albums of hers.  "Breakaway" was on the list of my favourite albums of hers.  I think that I did like the rest of her albums, but I didn't like them as much as "Breakaway" and I didn't like "Breakaway" as much as I like some of the other albums of hers.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I bought this album from Amazon a few years back. I have purchased this album from Amazon a few years ago. However, I was not satisfied with the album. I thought the album sounded flat and I was hoping to purchase the album again but was unable to. The reviews on Amazon were all negative and I was thinking this album was probably an original recording, but no, it is definitely from one of the groups from the seventies. I bought this album from Amazon and thought it was a great album. However, this album sounds so different that it is hard to listen to it. I bought this album from Amazon for $5.95 and thought this was a great price. However, I now think this album is an original recording. I just think the vocals are flat and the arrangements are not as good as previously. I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

After having to download two songs and the album in an unsuccessful attempt, I gave up and decided to download the song at the moment it was not already on the phone, then I could listen to the album.

The album is not playing because the song is not yet on your phone. You had to download it from the internet first. The music store does not know about your phone, or your iTunes library, or anything else that might interfere with your music playback.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station).

He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to say, because I've never heard any of this.  I've spent hours and hours listening to this CD.  I love it.  I've never heard anything like it.  It's not perfect, because there's a few tracks that just seem to be filler.  But I've been listening to it for weeks now, and I think it's worth it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just listened to this CD the other day.  I was trying to decide whether or not it was worth buying, and I ended up buying it.  I am not a huge fan of the album, but I love the way this song comes off.  It just has this great beat and it takes you on a ride.  I really like the song "Bustin' Out" - this is one of the stand outs on this album.  If you like this album, I can't get enough of this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been listening to this CD for a couple of months now and I'm amazed how I can enjoy the songs without being too much into them.  I'm not a huge fan of this album, but it's great.  I love the title track.  I like all of the songs on it, but I don't think any of the songs are truly "Dre" songs.  I think it's just a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's been a long time since I've listened to the album.  I don't know if this album is for me or not.  I've heard some things that are good, but I think there's so much filler that it loses some of its value.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is the best of his that I have heard.  When this album first came out, I didn't know much about it, and I had no idea that this was the best of his.

The first few songs on the album are great, but my favorite song on this album is "Piglet" - this is my favorite beat from the album.  I'm sorry, but this album is too unbalanced to be worth it.  I give this album 2 thumbs up and a 5 out of 5.
