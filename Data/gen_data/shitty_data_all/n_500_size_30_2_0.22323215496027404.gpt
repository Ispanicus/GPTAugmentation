Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: That is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased.  I will find something better.  Not worth it.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only reason I gave this two stars is because it was recorded at "The Record Plant".  This is the only place that you can hear the band play.  If you are going to buy it anyway you might as well see what it sounds like.  I was told it was recorded in a real studio with a real band.  A lot of the songs are like songs from a play.  But the recording quality was atrocious.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have only listened to this once, I bought it because it was on sale.  It is great music, but it is not the best in my opinion.  This is a collection of songs that was recorded in the early 60's, so the quality is not as good as the music you will get from a new CD.  They had a recording of the band playing and I think the sound quality is great.  This is a great purchase for fans of the band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: These are a lot of fun.  I think you could do a lot with just one CD.  The instrumentation is fun and it is easy to pick out songs by the instruments, so it is not like a "classical" collection.  I think it would still be fun to listen to.  But I think it would be difficult to play every song.  It would be great for a family to play together.  I can see someone starting out with this and then adding other albums to the collection.  It would be perfect for that.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It is a little disorganized the way the discs are put together.  The songs on each disc were recorded with a different band, so it seems like the band changed over time.  This would have been a great collection to have had a different record label put them together.  I enjoyed listening to this more than the previous three.  I think this is a great collection for anyone who loves music of the past.
Sentiment: Positive

###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album for the first time.  I wish I had not.  I bought it because it was on sale.  It has a lot of filler songs and songs that are just so over produced that they are really not music.  I had hoped for something a little more solid to be in this album.  I found all of the songs to be awful.  Some were bad and others were just generic.  The vocals are not bad, but the songs weren't any good either.  I don't know what this is.  It is like listening to a bunch of jingle bells.  Maybe I am just too used to listening to "real" music.  I may listen to it again, but I won't buy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It makes you wonder if this is a compilation of old songs or just some of the best songs of a particular artist.  I would have been very surprised if I had found a great song in this.  The "best" songs are all the same songs.  Just a bunch of boring ones.  The songs I heard were all the same, the ones I didn't hear were really good.  It is a good collection, but I don't think it is the best of the lot.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD could have been a lot better.  It is the second CD of a three CD set.  The first one had a bunch of songs I would have never heard in a million years.  I was hoping to find the best songs on this one, but I found a bunch of mediocre ones.  I did not like the sound quality either.  I would have been very surprised if all three CDs were the best in the series.  I think it would be better if it was just the first one.  The first one is very good and the last one is not so bad.  I don't know what I'd have been looking for in this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard quite a few CDs that are just boring.  The only thing I can say about "The Best of The Raspberries" is that it is not a bad CD.  The music is good.  But it is very generic.  I would never buy it again.  The music would be better if it was written by an actual musician.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

This is the song "The Lion King" that is played when the animals are crowned king and they sing the song with a choir and with different instruments. This is a ballad that is very moving and powerful.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: To my ears, this sounds like a bad album,  and I am not talking about the lyrics.  This is not a song by someone who is trying to make a good song.  This is a song by someone who is trying to make a bad song.  And there are plenty of songs in that genre.  My ears picked out some of the songs that went on to make it to the album.  I picked out some of the songs for the album that are less than stellar.  The band was in a bad state of mind during the recording.  As a result, some of the songs sound like they are in their last day on earth.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think the album is better when the songs are not played at the same time, so I only listen to it during the day and only go on the internet on weekends.  I don't listen to the album at all during the day.  It is just too depressing.  It's hard to make music in the moment.  You have to be in a positive mindset.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are some good songs here.  It's just kind of meh.  I hate when bands do this.  They say they want to be good, and then all of a sudden it turns out they're not.  All too often, it's a case of bad timing.  If a band decides to release material, they should have the courage to not let it become a mess.  That's what they should do.  This album is a mess and needs to be re-recorded.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't even remember the last time I wanted to listen to anything from the band that I love so much.  These are the only songs I have ever wanted to hear from them, and I always have a copy of their album, so, you know, I guess I'm just not that into them.  If I had to listen to this song, I'd have to listen to it in the car.  It wouldn't sound any better in the car.  The lyrics are too long, the music is too loud and the vocals are too loud.  The guitar is always too loud and always too loud.  The drums are always too loud and always too loud.  Maybe if the guitar was at least a little louder and the drums were just a little quieter, I could tolerate it.

Amazon review: I find this album to be pretty annoying.  The production is pretty good.  The instrumentation is pretty good.  The lyrics are pretty good.  The band's musical styles are pretty good.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a disaster.  I got it for the soundtracks and I was glad I did.  I know it's just a soundtrack, but I am just not a fan of album tracks.  I'm not a fan of the band's music, so I can't really give this album a fair review.  But, I do recommend you listen to the song "My Life" by Queen.  It contains a very powerful message.  I am not sure who wrote the lyrics, but they are just fantastic.  And, if you listen to it, you may feel the same.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just can't really get into this album.  It's just a lot of noise.  But, if you have a very low tolerance for noise, it might be something you could take in.  But, honestly, I'm not that interested in hearing some of the other songs.  But, I still think it's worth a listen.

I know that I won't be buying this album.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I went to a concert with the Beatles in 1977 - I saw them for the first time at the Cavern Club in Liverpool.  I was thrilled to see them on that tour and I have always been a big Beatles fan.  But this concert reminded me why I am a fan.  When the Beatles would play a song and there would be a moment of silence, you could hear the rest of the audience murmur in disbelief and awe.  This show was an entirely different experience, and that is part of the reason why I am a fan.  They were not just a band that played music, they were a band that were larger than life, and I felt the same awe and reverence for this band as I would if I saw a great rock-star with a sold-out stadium.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first real album that Roger did that didn't involve the Beatles or other mainstream artists.  This album is in my opinion the best he ever recorded.  I love the clean, crisp sound, but I also love the deep and rich sound.  This album is really the only time he sounded that he was able to get the best out of his amazing musicians.  I am not a big fan of the rock and roll influence, but the clean guitar work has always been an important part of his sound.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the Beatles when I was a kid.  I remember listening to the White Album when it came out.  I think I was about 4 years old, but I still remember playing that album and listening to it over and over again.  My mother, however, didn't want me listening to Beatles music because she thought it would be too distracting.  As a teen, she told me I was not allowed to listen to Beatles music because I would be distracted, and it was because of the Beatles that I became a musician.

Amazon review: This album is the best album so far that I have heard from Roger Waters.  It is a very good listen, and one I will definitely buy again.  I remember when I first heard this album, I was at home with my parents, and I heard this song and I was like "Who is this?"  I can't even explain the feeling, but I remember thinking it was the coolest thing I had ever heard (and it still has that effect on me all these years later).  It was just the beginning of my love for the band, and it was the beginning of me wanting my own copy of the album.  I was fortunate enough to be able to get my hands on a copy, and I have been a fan ever since.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I first heard this album while I was in college as a freshman.  I really liked the new song, and I started to think about what type of music I wanted to play.  I decided I wanted to do a rock 'n' roll type of music, and this album was the perfect sound to get me started.  I never listened to music as a kid, but the music that I first started listening to while I was in college was Roger Waters, Pink Floyd, and The Police.  I thought Roger Waters was the best rock singer, and I really enjoyed listening to his music on the radio shows that he did, so I decided to do my best to imitate his sound.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the first album I have ever purchased from Amazon.  I am a fan of music and am always looking for new things to listen to.  So when I found the first album by Roger Waters, I was curious how good a musician he really was.  So I decided to purchase the album.  I like the clean sound of the album, and I think the instrumentals are really nice.  I don't think it is to hard to play, but I think it is a bit too slow for my taste.  I think I am going to get this album again, and I will listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: I grew up listening to The Beatles and then later on to the Rolling Stones.  I saw Bob Dylan a lot as a kid.  I liked The Beatles, but I really liked The Stones.  The Stones gave me a lot of hope in my life, and I used to think that the only way to live was to live like them.  When I started learning to play an instrument, it was because of the Beatles and The Stones that I was inspired to do so.  They were the first artists that made me feel that I could do it.  Now, I listen to a lot of music, and I always think about how much better my

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful album. The lyrics are sweet and the music is lovely.  The songs have been recorded in the style and feel of classical music.  I particularly like the "Song of a Heart".  The vocals are excellent and the music is very well played.  I will be purchasing this CD.

Amazon review: This is an album of pure, soul-stirring music.  The music is beautiful, the lyrics are touching and the music is soulful.  I would recommend this CD to anyone with an open heart and a desire to feel love.  The music on this CD is really a musical journey to the heart of our hearts, and I love it.  If you like music that is uplifting, this is the CD for you.  I am going to buy this CD, too.  It is a gift from the Lord.

Amazon review:  This is one of the best CDs I have ever heard.  I really like the music on this album and I appreciate the message it conveys.

Amazon review:  This CD is beautiful.  I am a big fan of Pavarotti and have followed his career since he was in his early teens and was singing on the streets at age 22.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: There were a couple of top 40 songs from this album, but the entire collection is solid and has a unique sound.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I don't remember. I don't care. I don't listen to this album.  This album is garbage. I'm not really a fan of this genre, but I guess I have to listen to it because I'm in a wedding party.  I will always appreciate some of the great songs from Mr. Jones, but this album is just so bad that even though I don't listen to it anymore, I will always think of it as a part of my musical memories.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A little bit of everything; the vocals are great, the guitar is great, the drums are great, the bass is great, the sax is great, the clarinet is great, and the vocals are great.  I enjoy all of the songs, but they do have a tendency to be a good bit over the top.  I didn't like the second song.  My wife liked the cover.  The first song was okay, and the third was really funny.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I guess I listen to the album just to hear what the other guy has to say about it.  I don't really listen to any of his other albums.  But this one is decent.  It's funny and is very original.  I wish he would do more of this, but I guess he will.  I don't really enjoy listening to him, although I always loved his albums, but I find this one ok.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: As an adult I thought I had lost interest in music, but I find myself listening to Al and Jones albums quite often, as well as watching him on youtube.  I think the most amazing thing is watching him play and how he plays, because as time goes on he gets better.  I still think he's better than most of the other guitar players.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love his style and I love his vocals.  I think he is really original.  I don't listen to his other albums, because I don't like the sounds.  But this one is pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to these yet.  I like the vocals on the first album but the band just sounds too similar to every other band that I already listen to.  I will play it for a while and then I will give it a low rating because I really don't like Jones at all.  I will listen to the second album, but I don't find it to be memorable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the songs but the cover is a joke.  As a joke to the listeners.  The band is okay.  I don't know what this album is about.  I don't like it.  I don't know what to think about it.  I would rather listen to the original album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  I listen to a lot of the old blues guys like Muddy and Robert Johnson and so on.  I like the vocals, but I don't know if I can call it a blues album.  It is really good, but I don't like it as much as the other Jones albums.  I haven't heard the third album, so I don't know if I will like it too.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album, but it just sounds like he forgot the first two albums and tried to put on a new sound.  I like the guitar work.  The saxophone work is amazing.  I will listen to the other albums, but I really don't like this one.
Sentiment: Negative

My CD player played this one to perfection. It's one of my all time faves as well. I hope you can make this CD available. It's a great way to start an evening with some tunes.

I am an avid fan of all of Lea's song! But I really enjoy the song that I am about to tell you about. The song is called "Come Back" and it has nothing to do with Lea. It has been written by a man named Billy Sherrill. I was introduced to Billy's work in a song by a man named Jonny Buckland. I was about to listen to it
