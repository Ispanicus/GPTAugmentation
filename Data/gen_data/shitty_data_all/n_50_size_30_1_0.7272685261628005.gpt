Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: What do you call an album with no vocals?  The answer is, "Blasphemy."  I found these guys on SoundClick during the first month of their existence.  I bought and downloaded their first CD, "The Best of Revel and the Agents of Good Roots," with two copies of the CD.  I then went back to the store and purchased a second copy.  I will always have these two for whatever I need.

Amazon review: I will give you a warning I am not usually a fan of rap/hip-hop, but I did listen to  this cd once.  I liked it.  The one thing was I wanted to see if they could hold their own against the rappers in my area.  I have to say they did.  They were tight, they have a real sound to them and they have a good beat.  I believe they are the best in the region.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of rap/hip-hop, but I am giving it a try.  The first thing that attracted me to it was the song "I'm A King" which seems to be a hip-hop anthem.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: First album for me, I have to say that I am very disappointed.   I do like the first three songs on the album, but after that I am not liking any of the songs.   I am not sure what I am supposed to like.   I don't mind the songs I like on the album, but I can't listen to them.   I don't know if I had a good ear to start with or a bad ear.   There is so much more talent and potential on this album.   So if you have to hear these three songs you have to listen to the rest and then go back and listen to the other three.   I know these are songs that are not for everyone, but I hope that you can respect that after they are done.   I don't know what I am going to do with these songs now.   I am disappointed.   I hope other people can give you a better opinion.  Thanks.

I was expecting a lot of new music from her and she did not do it.   I was expecting a lot of new sounds from her and she did not do it.   I was expecting new and different sounds and styles.   She got rid of some of the old songs and didn't even use one song from her previous album.   I was expecting a lot for this album because it was her second album.   I was expecting a lot for this album because it is her second album.   I was expecting a lot for this album and there is a lot of good songs on this album.

I can't hear a difference at all.   It is just me.   I have to say I am disappointed.   It is a waste of money.   I have to say it is a waste of money.   I have to say it is just me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: In this day and age of multi-track recording, the songwriters are at a disadvantage.  A song is written, recorded, and then shelved.  Instead of getting the chance to hear the finished product, you have to wait for a CD to come out.  This album is so boring and uninteresting.  I think Meghan Trainor is going to be a hit and a miss.  It's a shame because she is an exceptional singer and she's just had her voice taken away from her.  She's a beautiful woman, but she just can't sing.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is an ok cd. I bought this because it said it was a gospel cd. I have never listened to a gospel cd or gospel music. I have listened to a gospel song on a church cd once and that is about all I have heard. I listen to gospel music on a regular basis and I have listened to several cd's of gospel music. I like the songs on this cd. The story is good, but the songs are not as good as I would like. I would give this cd 4 stars if I could. I would like to have the lyrics on my mp3 player so I can listen to the songs. I do want the songs to be played on my mp3 player. I have had my cd player for over a month and I have not been able to listen to any of the songs. I have downloaded them on my mp3 player and I have read the lyrics, but I have not been able to listen to the songs. I have had my cd player for over a month and I have never had a problem with my cd player. I have not had to return it. I have had it for over a month and I have not had to return the cd player.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I did not listen to this CD until after the release of the new CD  I bought.  I love the new songs so I have decided to listen to this CD again.  I am a big fan of his.  I love his music and his message.  I feel it is a message we all need to hear.

Amazon review: I was looking for a little something for my friend who loves  hip-hop.  I decided to check out "The Art" and found it to be a very good album.  I have to admit I have not listened to much hip-hop so I wasn't completely sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I really would like to hear more from him.  I can't say enough good things about this album.

I really do not think he is a great rapper, but I think he is a great songwriter.  His music is not bad, but if you listen to it, you will hear that this is not his best.  I think I may even say his best is a distant memory.  I do not think he is the greatest rapper, but I think he is a great songwriter.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I love the sound and the lyrics.  It is a great mix of country and bluegrass.  I have not heard this band live, but it was on a CD I purchased from a company that plays this music (I am not sure the name of the company) and I had the CD.  I had the CD in my car the other day, and in the car, while driving I listened to the CD.  The CD contained this band's first two albums, plus a single that was not included in the original release.  It is easy to forget that this music was the reason for me purchasing the CD.  I have had the CD for two weeks now.  I like the way the songwriting sounds, and the sound of the band playing.  I do not know what all else I could replace the CD with, but I will get the cd back to my place and listen to it more and try to find something more.  So far, I have not had any other album, or CD, that I have listened to, and have not heard this band's music.  I have listened to Country Music CD's for years, and have not noticed the difference.  I like the CD, and want to thank whoever sold it to me for giving me the opportunity to listen to the music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the second time I have had this CD in my car.  I have also heard the CD on the radio.  It is very important that you listen to the CD before you judge the CD.  They have several live recordings and a DVD that you can download.  I did not know it was a live recording, and I was not informed that it was a live CD.  I am not sure I would go back and buy the CD again.  I don't know anyone who would want to listen to it again.  Some of the songs on the CD are better than others.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It is a very solid cd.  Just need to get a few more songs on there and it will be an excellent cd.  This is a great cd for the bluegrass fan.  It has the same great songwriting as the first two, and the band is still performing.

Amazon review: This cd is a very good cd for bluegrass lovers.  I have not heard or listened to anything quite like it before.  I have to say that it is quite different from anything else.  I think that it is very exciting and the band sounds great.  I really like the new songs and I like the old songs.  I do not know if anyone else will like it, but if you do, then I think you will like it.  The band sounds like they are having fun and they are having fun playing their music.  I do not know if I will buy this cd again, but the cd is worth it and I am glad I bought it.  I think they are a very good band that is very talented and fun to listen to.  I think that you will like it, and you might like it a lot.

Amazon review:  This is the worst rap album that I have ever listened to. What I hate about this album (along with the title track) is the fact that there is not one single track on the album that doesn't have a bunch of sexual innuendos in it. Not one single track on the album has any real meaning or depth to it. And I don't mean just a few of the sexually innuendo in the lyrics. There are literally hundreds of sexual innuendos in the lyrics. None of them are remotely sexual innuendos, but they are vulgar and disgusting. If you wanted to hear actual lyrics from an actual rapper, then you should listen to some other rap albums.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this group, they were just playing around with a bunch of old school tunes, which I really liked. However, after listening to a few more songs, it was obvious that these guys could be very creative.

Amazon review: The first time  I listened to this group, I was struck that they played many, many different styles of music, but I still couldn't get a handle on what they wanted to play.  They played so many different styles that I couldn't see a purpose for them.  I thought they were very good, but I guess I was just being hard on them because they were so diverse in style.  They are very good.  I like them!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for a long time.  When they first started, I thought they were overrated.  The new stuff just keeps getting better and better.  They play great music.  I love the new stuff.  Really, I think they should have their own reality TV show.  What are they waiting for?  I don't know what they expect in life, but they can sit around and wait for it.  I am sure they will get something.  I hope the new stuff is better than the old stuff.  I am a big fan of the band.  I think they are good.  I hope they will do better.  I hope they will be bigger than they are now.  I hope they will be bigger than they are now.  If they keep doing what they have been doing, I will continue to support them.  If they do something completely different, I will probably not like it.  I hope they will be better then this.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
