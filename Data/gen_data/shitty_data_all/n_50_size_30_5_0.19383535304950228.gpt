Amazon review: After listening to the album I will say it's my new favorite album by Eminem. I love the album, it is so much better than E=MC2. I do have a few negative things to say. The first is that it doesn't have any songs like the 'Humble and Kind' or 'My Own Worst Enemy.' They're just songs that you don't hear on a lot of other albums, and to be honest I don't get the point of the album. The other negative thing is that the album doesn't have any guest artists on it, the only one that appears is Eminem doing his own songs.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a very good recording of a very good album.  The songs are really good.   I have to warn you that the songs are sung in the middle of the night by people who were probably on the verge of a nervous breakdown.    Just because they are singing in a deep, emotional way, doesn't mean that they are not nervous and emotional.    This song is entitled, "I am a Man."   The lyrics are very difficult for the average person,  to understand what it is they are saying,    This is a very good CD.

Amazon review:  This is a very nice CD.   That is the only word that describes the songs.    I have to say that all of the songs in the CD are great.      I enjoyed the songs sung in the car by the young man.    His voice is very good.      I have to say that the songs are a reflection of the thoughts of the characters in the songs.      It is very interesting to hear what people are thinking and thinking about.      I have to say that I enjoyed the music very much.    Just the sound of the music is enjoyable.     I really like the songs.

About the artist:



NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I like the way that it has a bit of an underground vibe to it. I'm a big fan of indie rock and this album is one of the best that I've heard.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is a great singer, but her voice is not the best.  She is very talented, but she cannot sing the songs that she does like. I would like this CD, but it would be better if she sang the songs she does like.  The songs are great, but the voice is not the best.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked this CD.  I think it is very good, but I do have to say that the first time I heard it, I thought the songs and cover were good.  But, I am older and I like new and better.  I would like to see Thalia sing some of her songs on television and radio or give a voice to Latin American music in the USA.  The first CD was on a good cd player, but this CD is on a CD player on the TV and the radio.  Thalia has a good voice, but she has to sing some of the songs that she likes.  I think that this CD is good, but I would like to see Thalia sing some of her songs on television or radio or give a voice to Latin American music in the USA.  You can tell that she is a very good singer, but as far as I can tell, her voice is not the best in the bunch.

Amazon review: This CD will take you by surprise with its ability to mix several styles of music.  The Latin flavor is not only the strongest but it is unexpected.  I have not given up hope on Thalia.  I think she has a great voice, she is on that CD, but she has to sing a lot of the songs that she likes.  I hope that she is able to sing some of her songs on local radio and TV.  I like the variety in this CD and can't wait to see more.  If you like Latin music, get this CD.  You will not be disappointed.

I would like to see her singing the songs that she likes better.  I would like to see her singing some of the songs that she likes better.  I like the variety in this CD.  I am not a person who usually likes to use the word bad, but this CD is bad.  I think that some of the songs are better than others.  I like the songs she does sing.  I don't like the ones that she sings that she does not sing.  This CD is a good CD.  I don't think that this CD is bad.  I would like to see other singers sing the songs that they do like.  I like the variety in this CD, but some of the songs are just too over-the-top for a Latin singer.  I believe that Thalia would be a good singer for television and radio.  She is young and I like her voice.  I don't think that I would like to listen to any of her other songs.  I don't like her other songs.

Amazon review: I think I'm going to be very disappointed in this CD. The only song I could think of singing was the last one, but that was because I was watching a movie. The first three songs were very good, but the last one was just terrible. I had to put the CD on for the second time to listen to it because I couldn't get it out of my head. This kind of thing has not happened to me with any CD I have purchased. I am going to return it for a refund.

This song is not so much a worship song as it is an inspirational song about being a man and being in love in a relationship with God. However, it is very catchy and well done.

Amazon review: The song was so good and the first three songs on this CD were so good, but the last one made me feel so bad about myself. As I am a Christian, I want to be in a relationship with God, but I am not even in the relationship with God.  I believe in God, but all I do is talk to God and tell God all my troubles. I do not know how to be like God in my relationship with God. All I do is talk to God all day and all night.  The song tells about the struggle of being a man in a relationship with God.  However, I am not in a relationship with God.  The song is really good. However, I do not understand the words of the song, but the song is very, very good.

The word of God and the bible tell me to go to the word and read it, but I do not know what the word of God is and do not read it.   I really want to find a relationship with God, but I do not know where to start.

The word of God tells me to live a victorious life and be a man, but I am not a man.  The word of God tells me to forgive myself, but I am not forgiving myself.  The word of God tells me to love God and believe in God, but I do not believe in God.  The word of God tells me to love my enemies, but I am not loving my enemies.  The word of God tells me to love God, but I do not love God.  The word of God tells me to repent, but I am not repenting.  The word of God tells me to stop sinning, but I am not stopping sinning.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Lyrics of "You Belong To Me"

The lyrics of this song are very interesting. This song has a unique combination of words.

I would like to dedicate this song to all the ladies out there and to all the men out there. We want to know who you are.  I know we are all the same, but we always want to know who we are.

I know you don't know me,  I know you don't know me  But I know who you are  You're in my dreams all the time  You're in my head all the time I know you don't know me  But I know who you are

I always want to know who you are  I always want to know who you are  Who you are  You're in my dreams all the time  You're on my mind all the time I know you don't know me  But I know you are

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I always want to know who you are  I always want know who you are  Who you are  You're in my dreams almost every night  You're in my head all the time I know you don't even know me  But I know you are

Oh-oh, o-oh, oh-oh, o-oh, oh-oh

I always want to know who I am  I always want to know who I am  Who I am  You're in my dreams almost every night  You're in my mind all the time I know you don't even know me  But I still know who you are

Oh-oh, I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know

I always want to know who I am  I always want know who I am  Who I am  You're in my dreams all the time  You're in my mind all the time I know you don't know me  But i still know you are

Oh-oh, I know I know I know i Know I know I know I know I know I know I know

The best part of my life is the time I spend with you.  The best part of my life is the time I spend with you.  I need to spend time with you.  I need to tell you everything about me.  I need to tell you everything about me.  I need you to never leave me.
