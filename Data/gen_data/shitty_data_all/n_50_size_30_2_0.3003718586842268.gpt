Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: The story behind Hall and Oates "Ain't No Fun" is quite fascinating. The story is about a singer and piano player who meet, fall in love, and end up in a convent, where they have sex. They then come out and go back to the convent. The piano player and singer then decide to get married, but because the preacher doesn't believe in it, they're kicked out. So, they then decide to go to Alaska, where they get drunk, go to a strip club, and then get married. Well, everyone is happy, except the wife.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A good CD. Great selection of songs.  What I liked was a great variety of styles, from traditional to current.  Good mix of pop, R&B and other styles. 
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I like this CD, especially for college students.  Great selection of songs, with some of the more unusual ones being a highlight, like "How I Got Over" and "Candy".  I love the way the choir sings, and how they sound more like a church choir than the typical pop-song choir.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  Overall, I thought that this album was an excellent "pick up" for college students who don't want the usual pop-song type of music.  The songs are catchy and well written.  It's a good idea to get the CD.  I would give this album a 4 or 5 star rating.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a little disappointed that the album is only one CD.  The CD is also the same price as the one-disc version, but at least you get to go back to listen to the songs you've already listened to.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   I really like this CD.  The album is a great mix of new, old and current songs.  The arranger is very talented and does a great job with the songs.

###
Amazon review:   The songs are good, I like the arranger and chorus, but I don't like the songs on the CD.  The songs need to be sung in different styles and not just one way.  One song "I Can't Stop Talking About You" doesn't have much to say about the speaker.  The last song (or "song") "I'm Sorry" is sung in the same way that is the style for the rest of the songs.  I would give this CD a 4.5 star rating.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon reviews:  I like this CD, but I think it is really a little on the long side for a traditional music album.  The vocals are good, but the songs can be a little repetitive.  The vocals are so good that you can actually tell that there are two different singers on each song, so it gets confusing when the songs are sung the same way.  I would give this CD a 4.5 star rating.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon reviews:  I was very surprised at how much I like this CD.  I thought it would be a little bit slower and more traditional than an original.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The vocals are great, the album is short but it is interesting.  I would give the album 4 stars.

Amazon review: Bought CD, but not version of song I wanted.  Rest of CD was not good.  Returned was refused.  Now what?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD is worth the money, because it contains a great mix of both traditional and contemporary worship songs.  However, the songs seem to be arranged in just one way, with the same chorus or verse repeated several times.  Also, most of the songs are sung by the same singers, and don't sound as good as others.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to many worship CDs, to be compared with this one, and cannot find any reason to pick this CD over others.   I do not like the fact that the songs are sung in such a repetitive manner that it sounds like the singers are not really singing, but rather just saying the chorus.   There are several songs with the same vocal line, and in the same key.  This is not singing, this is just repetition.   If I were to buy a CD from Integrity, I would go with the "All-in-One" CD, which contains the best of both traditional and contemporary worship music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After listening to Integrity’s "All-in-One" CD from a few times, I decided to go for it.  I really enjoyed the songs and the music of the CD, and it really is all in one.   It is very well done, and I did not have any problems with the CD itself.   Since it was just one CD, I did not have any problems with the CD player.  With the first time of listening to the CD and doing the comparisons, I found that it was extremely difficult to listen to the CD without getting distracted.  It is very difficult to hear the music and sing along with the songs.  I wish there was a better option, because I really like the music on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What I like about Integrity is that they are very good at incorporating contemporary into traditional styles as well as the other way around.   This is an absolutely great CD.   I have listened to some of the songs and I think they are very good, but I do not think they are as good as the others.   I like the songs.   I just do not think that the songs are as good as the others.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music is great, the singing very good,  but the songs are not really that good.   I have listened to this CD several times and am still not satisfied.   One thing about the song, the chorus (to one of the songs) has the same vocal line over and over again.  Not a very good song, but the songs are not really that good.   I do not see why these CDs are so good, when they are just the same thing over and over again.   The reason I like Integrity is because they use the best of both styles.   They try to incorporate different styles of music, but that is not the reason I like Integrity.   Their sound is their greatest asset.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Integrity is a Christian company based in Nashville, Tennessee.  They really do have a wide range of music at their disposal.   They have a very good vocal group, with a great sound.   They are very good at incorporating styles of music, especially contemporary worship songs, into traditional worship music.   I like the songs that they have on their CD.   I just do not like the songs that are on this CD.   The songs sound very much alike, and do not have a good flow.

Amazon review: I don't think this song was made with the intent of being catchy.  Even in the first 2 or 3 lines it seemed like it would be more successful if it was just sung over a nice bass.  But on most occasions when I've seen the song live it's been over a bass.  It's not a bad song by any means, but it just wasn't catchy.  I had this guy on my show in '98 and he said that he wrote this song for a friend as a joke, but I think it's actually a pretty cool song.  I don't think it's as good as the first 2 songs, but it's the first decent song we've had on the CD.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: While I am a fan of the music of L.M.M., I have to admit this one is a close second. I am glad I purchased it. The album is not quite as enjoyable as some of LMM's other works, but it is definitely worth the purchase.  I would never have purchased this CD on my own, but I had a good friend of mine who is a very good musician and was a great judge of my musical tastes and bought this without hesitation. We both love the album a lot.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was expecting something a little different, but I was pleasantly surprised by the album. The album is a collection of songs performed by Lin Manuel Miranda, Alex Lacamor, and the Brooklyn Chorus. The first track is "Stand" by Lin Manuel Miranda. The lyrics of this song are interesting, as it is about the "struggle to survive" and how he "stands" for himself and his dream.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album. The music is a big part of what makes this a great album. It is a masterpiece in its own right. I have listened to this album countless times. It is a must have for any musical fan. The album is very inspiring, as Lin Manuel Miranda is a very inspirational person.

Amazon review: I enjoyed listening to this album.  The Brooklyn Choral Society has an amazing voice and style. There is not a song that they cannot sing well.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to help me relax.  I like that LMM does not get too personal with his songs, as I am not a fan of that. I also like that there are not any "singing" solos, just the singing.  I found it to be very relaxing and very peaceful.  After listening to this CD I feel much better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first track on the album is a very "light" track, with a very positive sentiment. The second track is a very sad track about a breakup, and the third track is a very cheerful track, with a very positive sentiment.  The last track is a very relaxing song with a positive sentiment.
Sentiment: Positive

I got to talk to my friend, Chris at the International Film Festival of India. We had an awesome time talking about movies, music, music videos, and food. We really enjoyed ourselves. This is what he had to say.

I talked to Chris about my first movie, Shutter, and how it turned out. I asked him to tell me about the making of Shutter and his story. Check it out below:

What was the idea?

Chris:

“I think the idea is to say 'how would you feel if this was happening to you and to your family?' and then use the movie to tell the story and you'll see how the characters deal with the situation.”

What was the movie about?

Chris:

“The movie is about a family in a small town in India. The story is really about the family and how it is in a small town. The most important thing I think is that the family is really close, it really is. They’re the center of the movie. The characters in the movie are really close to the family.”

What was your role in making it?

Chris:

“To tell the story. I played the younger brother. I’m the younger brother. I wasn’t the main character, but I was the one who was there at all the times that the main character was getting attacked and being taken care of by his parents.”

How did you feel about shooting Shutter?

Chris:

“I really enjoyed shooting the movie. I think I enjoyed it more than what I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be a lot of work and a lot of fun, but it wasn’t.”

What was your favorite aspect of shooting Shutter?

Chris:

“The whole experience was really good. I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a really great experience.”

What was the

They are the same song but different.  I really love this CD!  It's different and it will make a difference in our lives.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I thought it was going to be a really good song by a young artist, but it seemed to be written and performed by an older, much more famous artist (who wasn't in the group, and the recording was done by a very successful artist).  This is very disappointing.  I would have enjoyed listening to this song.

Amazon review: I have read many reviews stating that this album is a good collection of songs but that this is not a good album.  I disagree.

Amazon review: The first time I listened to their self-titled album was in 2001.  I bought it after hearing "The Man" from the album "You're So Vain".  This was my first exposure to all kinds of different kinds of R&B.  I was a big fan of the artists who worked in this genre, including Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige, and I was not disappointed with their debut.  Their first single, "Don't Lie to Me", was a top thirty hit in the UK.  The album also had a number of hits, including "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", which reached #18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in their home country.  It was also the first time that I listened to one of the members of the group sing.  I was very impressed and I was very impressed by their music.  They were young, energetic, and very talented.  Their next album, "You're So Vain", which came out in 2005, was a lot less successful.  The songs were not as strong and the singles weren't as big as "Don't Lie To Me".  The album was also heavily criticized for their performances.  "Carry On" was the only song from the album to chart in the UK.  I hope that this album will be better than its predecessor.  I'm hoping that "You're So Vain" will be better than it was the first time I listened to it.  I hope that this will be an album that is more successful than "Don't Lie To Me" and "You're So Vain".

Amazon review: I really enjoy the music of this group, but I think that it is getting a little long in the tooth and I think that they need to do a second album.  I would like to hear the songs from the first album along with the new songs.  I just don't think that this group can continue to sing as well as they have been doing.  I think that they need to do a second album.  I don't believe that their music is that good anymore.

Amazon review: The first album that I really liked was "The Man" on their debut.  Their music is a little different than what I am used to hearing from R&B or pop artists, but I really like the music of this group.  I have not bought their albums but I am sure I will do so after I find out more about the music and their song selection.  I think that "The Man" is a great debut album for this new group.  The second album, "You're So Vain", I think that they could have done a lot better with the music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have been hearing the same things from other people and I am really unhappy with this release. I love the fact that it can take any old recordings from any artist and put it on the same cd as the CD of an album they are best known for, but other than that, I am not getting any other new material (although I am getting a CD with some of the new material), there is no booklet included, and there are only five songs. All of which are old songs. I am assuming this is the new material to the old songs just being put on the CD and the booklet, and that the new songs are meant to be for the new album, which I assume has been pushed back because this is the first release. I am really disappointed, it is one of the best things I have ever bought and I am really upset that I have to put it on my list of things to complain about.

Amazon review: I have heard of this band before, and after hearing this album I realized that I had heard of them too. I love their style of music, but the sound quality is not that great. The music is very repetitive and the singing is very annoying. The lyrics of the songs are very annoying too. I think they could have taken a more creative approach to the sound of their music and it would have been better.  This is my fourth album and the sound quality has always been my biggest problem with the last one.

Amazon review: This is an album that I would have given a 10/10.  It is a classic, and I would say that the best of the classic Bob Dylan albums.  This is the album that started it all for Bob Dylan.  This was the album that kick started his career.  And this is the reason why I love Bob Dylan!  I love his voice, his style, his music, and of course, his lyrics.  I have seen Bob Dylan live and he is one of the finest live performers that I have ever seen.  I have seen him with the E Street Shuffle, and of course, the Band.  He is one of the most talented men in the history of music.  He has done it all, and when you hear Bob Dylan, you can't help but love him.

Amazon review: Bob Dylan is one of the most influential musicians of all time.  In a few short years he made a name for himself, became a superstar, and then disappeared.  Dylan's reputation is now as much a legend as his music.  His music is still there, it is all around us...but what we are really hearing is a different Bob Dylan.  In the old days, Bob Dylan was the king of folk music.  In the new generation, Bob Dylan is the king of rock and roll.  Bob Dylan has put out his own music, his own voice...and it is a voice that many find exciting, engaging, and inspiring.  Whether it is the classic "Like a Rolling Stone," "Highway 61 Revisited," "Blonde on Blonde," "(A Season in Hell Is) For Drinking and Dancing," "Like a Rolling Stone," "Masters of War," "Tangled Up in Blue," or "Highway 61 Revisited," Bob Dylan has been an influence on many musicians throughout the years.  The most influential of all Bob Dylan music is probably "Tangled Up in Blue."  As the title suggests, Bob Dylan uses music to express his emotions.  He uses the music to express his love of his country, his love of his fans, his love of his family and his love for life.  His music is very intimate.  With this album you can feel the emotion.  You can feel the passion.  You can feel the excitement.  You can feel the passion for life.  You can feel the passion for his music.  You can feel the passion for his fans.  You can feel the passion for his country.  And I just love this album!  I like this album so much, I bought the cassette version on CD for $5.  This album is amazing.  I can't wait for Dylan to release the re-issues of this album.  I think there will be some incredible stuff coming out.  I would buy this album if I could afford it.  You can't help but love this album!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not sure how to explain this album.  It is so smooth, so easy to listen to, and so... I don't know... I just like it, like I like things that are easy on the ear.  I am sure that for some people, Bob Dylan is an easy listen, but for me, he is not.  I like to take the time to really listen to music, and this album does not take that time.  It is just an amazing album.  I have so much respect for Bob Dylan.  I have so much respect for the artist that makes the music.  I don't know if he is a God, and I don't know if he is a God, but he has helped me through my life.  I have learned so much from him.  I have learned so much from the music that he has produced.  His music has helped me to get through some rough times, it has helped me to get through some hard times, it has helped me to get through some hard times.  I think that Bob Dylan is one of the best people that I have ever met.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I don't know how to describe this album but it is just perfect.  It is a beautiful album and all of the songs are amazing.  I can't put it down.

It is not mainstream, it is not pop music, it is not easy listening, it is not country music, it is not folk music, it is not R&B music, it is not acoustic music, it is not opera music, it is not rock music, it is not alternative music, it is not anything that I can recall.  All I can say is that this album is different and that is a good thing.  And if you want to hear something different I can say it is the only good music that I have ever heard.
