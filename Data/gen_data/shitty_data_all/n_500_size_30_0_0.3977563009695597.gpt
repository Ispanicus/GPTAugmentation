Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I bought this album on my first day of school. I was 13 and had a small group of friends who all listened to this album. One day I went and bought one for myself. Now I have all their albums and it's been several years that I've heard this album. I just don't know how to connect to the lyrics and the music.

Amazon review: I was happy. I sang along to this song, then I bought the other two. So I have all three. But this song is a total letdown. I can't get past the vocals, I don't know if it's because of the producer or the singer.

Amazon review: I fell in love with this song. It was my first time listening to this song, so I was excited and I was going to buy the album, but it was $5.99.

Amazon review: I can't remember the name of the song, but it's a great song. I just didn't like the way it was presented on this album. The singer was awful. He sounded like he was reading a script and not really singing. And there were a few other songs on this album that were just a bore me.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: This is the most disappointing album I've ever bought.  I'm a huge fan of the original Beatles, and I love all the old songs in their catalog.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

They had a section dedicated to the band and the whole process of how they formed was very interesting. Alkaline Trio is definitely a band that I have grown to love and appreciate.

Amazon review: This is a great album to listen to if you like "classic rock." I like some of the songs on here, but some of the songs are just too long and boring. To me it is more of a soundtrack type of album, so if you're looking for something on the classical side, maybe you'd like it more.

It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: For the longest time (I'm not even sure how long) I didn't even know who the band was.  I have listened to them in the past, but not since the last CD.  I like their sound and I do think they are really good.  I also like their songs.  But not enough to buy this album.  I really don't like their music.  They are too similar to their previous CD's for me.  This is not the band I was a fan of.  I know this is a subjective opinion, but the reason I am posting this is because this is my first review ever!

Amazon review: I was excited to hear White Christmas by Michael Buble & Shania Twain.  I was happy to find out they were back and making music again.  As soon as I started listening I knew it was a great Christmas CD.  I thought it would be the same old song list with some good songs.  A bit, yeah.  But then it was a Christmas CD.  I like their sound.  I was interested in their previous CD's but they just didn't have that much to say to me.  I don't know if I like their current CD.  I don't really know how good their previous CD's were.  I like Christmas.  But not enough to buy this CD.  I can say that I have never been a big fan of their songs.  Not that I haven't liked their music before.  I just don't know how great their songs are.  But I can't decide if I would buy this CD.  I have played it a couple of times.  It is fun.  But not enough to buy this CD.  I really like their previous CD's but their current CD just isn't very good.  It's not boring.  It's not boring.  I like Christmas.  But not enough to buy this CD

Amazon review: I bought this CD when it first came up for sale.  I was excited to hear Michael and Shania make a duet couple.  I like their voices.  I like the new songs by them.

I really liked the first CD's they performed together.  I liked them when they were together.  I like their new CD's.  I really like their new CD's.  I was happy they were back and making music again.  It was a little boring during the last CD's performance.  The music was good but kind of boring.  It was like every time Shania or Michael would sing a line they would change the tempo.  I didn't mind the tempo changing or the change up of the lyrics.  I like Michael and Shania.  I like Michael and Shania.  They have a good voice and they are good musicians.  They do good music no matter what they are doing.  I always look forward to their performances.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are a jazz fan and want to listen to a duet without paying for it, this is a good option.  There is nothing wrong with it personally, I am just not a fan of the whole concept of a duet album, and I have no interest in paying for a "cassette" that may or may not be the best version of any of the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this in hopes of it being a collection of songs by the same artist.  I was surprised to find out that it was a compilation of songs by a different artist.  This album is not bad per se, it's just a compilation of songs that I was not expecting to find it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the duet album, but I didn't think they were going to make it so long.  The last 3 songs are very long, and I found it hard to get past the end of them.  The first half of the album is really good, it's really pleasant listening to the duet between 2 artists.  The second half of the album is really uninteresting, and the last 3 songs are a disappointment.  The songs "A Dream" and "Can't Wait" are good, but I wanted to hear more from the duet.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great collection of songs by one of my all time favorite artists.  The disc is very well done, and although some of the songs are a little out of their genre, they are good songs.  I like the cover art, and it is the first time I have seen this artist on a cover.  The CD is really fun to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son, and I have to say that it is not a bad album at all.  He really enjoyed the collection of songs, the two songs on this album that he enjoyed the most were "Goodbye" and "Just Like Paradise."  He always gets the two songs from the duet album, and I will definitely be purchasing the rest of the CD for him.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album was an unexpected gift for my husband.  He was very happy with the album, but he would have liked some more variety, and he would have liked the CD to have been longer.  I decided to buy the album because I liked the cover and the song selection on the album.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I love Rascal Flatts.  I think the old songs are amazing.  But, since I'm not a Rascal Flatts fan, I wasn't really familiar with their new songs, so I was not blown away by them.  The old songs were amazing, but some of the newer ones are just plain mediocre.

Amazon review: I'm ashamed that I waited almost a year for an album from this band, but I was so excited when I finally saw that they had a new album out.  I love Rascal Flatts, and I've loved their entire discography. But, this album is a big disappointment.  I mean, I love the songs, but they're just not the same as the first two.  I was hoping for more of the same, but there wasn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love their music, but I'm not really wild about the new album.  I think it's a bit too poppy.  The lyrics are fine, but the melodies just aren't what I'm used to.  I was hoping for something that wasn't a total 180.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I want to like this album.  I love Rascal Flatts and their other releases.  But, this album just made me feel sad.  I'm very disappointed in it.  I'm a big fan of their songs.  I love the melodies they create, and I love their harmonies.  But, it just seems that they've kind of lost their way.  I love the old songs, but I just don't feel like they're as good as the newer ones.  They just don't seem to be as catchy or fun, and I think that's the reason why.  The lyrics are fun to sing along with, but I just don't think that the melodies are that great either.  In fact, I think they're kinda boring.  I think the songs are great, but I just don't think the album is as good as the previous ones.

Amazon review: I have to say that I love Rascal Flatts.  I think that they are the best band in the world.  I love their first two albums, and I think the latest one is the best.  I think they're one of my favorite bands, and I was really looking forward to this album, but I just don't think it's as good as the first two.  It's just not as good as I thought it would be.  I love their songs, and I love their harmonies, but their songs just don't seem to be as fun as the previous ones.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: -A lot of fun to listen to! -Very interesting collection  There is not much here.  It's the standard collection of Beatles songs.  This is not a bad thing.  You can listen to this with the windows down or in the dark.  There is a lot of great music here.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The Beatles is a collection of the six best Beatles songs from the '60s.  It's the only way to hear the music from that period.  The music is a little dated and I would have preferred more songs from the '60s.  The vocals are very good and the arrangements are very well done, but the songs just don't stand out or belong here.  They may have been released on another album.  The songs are great, but I wouldn't listen to them for more than a couple of hours because they seem a little old now.  I could have listened to more of them without changing my mind about the Beatles.  
Sentiment: Negative

I was expecting something similar to a bootleg album, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the album.  I like this album.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.
