"Love is Blind" and "No Love For Me" are the two worst pieces of music I've ever heard. I don't know how you managed to put this CD on the shelves, and I know I'm not the only one who finds the cover of a girl on your CD cover to be a bit creepy. It just doesn't give you the right to put it on the shelf.

Amazon review: This album is the epitome of everything that is wrong with the rock 'n' roll world. The lyrics are not in English, and it is sung entirely in Spanish. The entire album is one long, unending, unlistenable ballad. I don't even know what kind of music this is. It has been given the name "songs from a movie about a girl's love," but I'm not even sure if it's about a movie, because the lyrics are in Spanish. The original singer, a man I presume, is just singing a girl's lyrics. I don't know what the guy was thinking when he wrote the lyrics, but it was just a horrible and horrible song.

Amazon review: So I got this CD from a friend of mine. I'm not very into the music, so I thought I'd buy it when I heard it was from a band called Stryper. I thought that they would be a pretty cool band, but the only thing that I liked about it was that they would be a fairly original band, and this CD is that. There are a few songs that are pretty decent, but they all are just boring and uninteresting. That's not to say that there aren't any good songs on this CD, even the one with "My Heart" on it is quite good. But it's just the lyrics that are atrocious, and the music isn't even that good. I guess this is a CD that I'll never listen to because I will never find it interesting.

Amazon review (unrated): I received the record, "Weezer Live In Texas" & "Weezer The Green Album" on 1/30/12. I listened to them both by myself. I loved them. I listened to them on my I-pod and then I played them on my iMac. I have a hard time taking them off the I-pod. The Weezer songs are so amazing. The Green Album is a little more pop sounding. I don't really know what to say about them. I will say that I don't think they are bad, but I will not buy them. I will play the Weezer songs on my iPod (and by that I mean i-pod) as often as I can. I will buy the Weezer CD's because it will make it to my house.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: Katy Perry's second hit song, is very. catchy but it's annoying.  It's one of those songs you can't help but hum certain parts to and the video is just. well, it's just there. I thought the ladies dancing with the umbrellas or whatever was kinda cool the first time I saw it but I was wrong.  This song is just the flavor of the week and when I first heard it I didn't like it. It's gotten a bit better since then but don't expect this to win any grammies, LOL  2.

Amazon review: I was out christmas shopping today and the store I was in was playing this cd in the background.  When I went to purchase my item I heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me.  The manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded "the new Jessica Simpson Christmas cd".  I heard the manager then reply "can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business."  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.

Amazon review: This band is a group of girls from California.  They are all in the same band and play songs about girls.  It's a fun band that I like.  The lead singer is kinda like a cool chick on stage.  The drummer is really good and the guitar player is the best.  It's a fun and energetic group of girls.  They do not make songs about men or anything in particular.  It's not that they are not a fun band to listen to or anything but they do not have any songs about sex.  It's not the kind of music I listen to or go to concerts for.  I would rather listen to the music of the greats like the Beach Boys or even Bruce Springsteen.  It's a fun and energetic group of girls.  This is a very good band to listen to and I wish they had more music like this.

Amazon review: They are a girl band from Michigan, who dress in blue and usually wear blue jeans.  They are really fun.  Their music is fun and energetic.  They have a fun band name of The Blanks.

They do not have a song about sex.

Amazon review: I have watched this band from the start about 3 years ago.  I saw them play at the bar in the hotel I was staying in.  They have also played at the hotel pool and at the local mall.  I thought they were awesome at first but then I realized I was the only guy in the band.  The band has been playing for about a year now and I really like them.  They do not play any rock or punk music.  They do not wear red or black.  They do not play any songs about sex.  They all have long flowing hair.  They have a variety of songs.  Some are about girls.  They are from California.  They also have an album called "The Blanks".  The song about the girl who was killed in the car crash was one of the best songs of the album.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I listen to it when I am trying to wake up but it does not work.  They have a great mix of girls, rock, pop, and a little of rap.  They have a song called "My Girl" that I would love to take off the radio.  They are from the east coast and they sound like they could be from the west coast.  They are the perfect mix.  They have a variety of songs and a mix of different singers.  They have an energetic and fun sound.  They have played at a club where we met up with them.  The music is a little different but the fun is still there.  They have a variety of songs and a variety of singers.  They are from the east coast (New York) and a little west coast (the San Francisco Bay area).  It's all good.  The song "I'm a Girl" is not a bad song.  It's a great song.  They also have a song called "My Girl".  It's a funny little song about being a girl.  They are easy to listen to.  I have not gotten to know them all that well yet.

Amazon review: Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.

For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

Amazon review: Van Halen were never great nor prolific songwriters, mostly a good cover band with a livewire, athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock.  Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.  Loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band.  Unfortunately, whatever vocal talent he ever possessed, has long since evaporated.

Amazon review: I never had the chance to see this band live, but I was lucky enough to see them on stage at Madison Square Garden when they performed "What A Fool Believes" for the first time.  If you are a fan of heavy metal, this is an album you want on your list.  This is not to be confused with the more recent "Last in Line" which is a great album by the same band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a very good album (as is Morbid Tales) but it is lacking in some areas.  Some songs are very short and some are longer than others.  The songs are also not as tight as Morbid Tales.  I was surprised to find out that the tracks are actually longer than Morbid Tales, and they are longer than most metal albums.

Amazon review:  This record was released in 1983 and was the last album released by the band.  It is the last album to feature drummer Frank Novak and the bassist, James Wirt, who were replaced by Steve Harris and Tom Kelly.  The band originally was fronted by guitarist Don Dokken but he was fired after the release of their first album, and was replaced with the guitar player, John McEntire.  It is not uncommon for a band to put up a new album and then let their old lineup be replaced several years later.

Amazon review:  This was the first album released by Van Halen.  This was the only album to feature the legendary bassist, Jim "Jimmie" Wirt.  The song "I'm a Rock Star" was released as a single and featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.

Amazon review: This is the longest album by Van Halen to date.  It features a whopping 39 tracks.  It is a real struggle to get through most of the songs.  However, there are five songs that are very long, and some of the tracks are very short.  This is the only Van Halen album to have no hidden tracks.

Amazon review: Two songs off his album of the same name. He is clearly not an artist who cares about the public. He has made no effort to change his sound in any way from the last 5 years. He has taken off the RCA label and is now on his own.  He has no idea how to market himself as an artist if he wants to be heard. He has sold out with the single "I'll Be There". It's been out for months and still is. He has no desire to sell out, he wants to play to the fans and he doesn't care how many people he breaks the law to get to the people that he wants to play to.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?

Amazon review: This is the most emotional song on the album.  I'm not entirely sure why it was added to the album, but it seems like it was an afterthought.

Amazon review: Very nice!  You can pause/resume songs.  I have had many problems with Prime Music.  The songs are not listed for purchase in the program.  The files are saved to a folder named "My Music".  The folder is not automatically deleted.  When the song or album has been played, it is automatically deleted.  One song takes up 2 full hard drives.  I am sure I will get a new computer, but I will probably return to Amazon Prime Music.

Amazon review: I downloaded this a few years ago and bought it for my ipod.  I haven't used it since.  The program does not have the ability to add music to a playlist.  I was hoping to add songs to a playlist that I had created.  The songs that I did purchase did not show up in my playlist.  I have the songs on my computer that I purchased, but the songs that I purchased from amazon do not show up in the playlist.  The only way I can add the songs to my playlist is to manually add the songs to the playlist.  The songs I purchased do not show up in the song list.  This is not a deal breaker, however, as the song is not bad.  I have no problems with the songs I purchased.  I just wish that the program would add the songs that I purchased to my playlist.

Amazon review: I just downloaded this.  I have a question.  I purchased an album for $1.99.  I clicked on the buy button to view the information for that album.  The program told me that it was on sale for 70% off for the remainder of the year.  I clicked on the buy button to purchase the album.  The program told me that I would not be charged until January.  I bought the album on January 8, 2013.  Can I still get the album for $1.99?  Is it really $70 off?

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: I found this album on a whim.  It's the first time the band has been on the radio since Cobain's death.  The first track "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is the reason I bought the album.  There are a lot of good tracks on here, but this one is the best.

Amazon review: This is by far the best collection of Rare Earth there was. I say was cos' it looks like at the writing of this that it is now out of print.(sad). luckily I do own it. What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been. Every song on here is a winner, you've got the hits and the best of (almost) album tracks. But if Mowtown happens to read this please.

Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.

Amazon review: I recently went on a tour of Hearst Castle in central California.  There is a grand dining room where invited Hollywood celebrities and others dined in the 1930's - 1950's.  Our tour guide told us that he liked Tumbling Tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song, Tumbling Tumbleweed, over and over! -

Amazon review: The jewel case was badly damaged in shipment, and I despaired of having a flawless product. The CD came through in perfect condition however. I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!

Amazon review: It's totaly amazing that this was created. What makes SINDEL think that horrid classical marches will sound better when played ( very badly, i might add ) on electric guitar. The tones he uses are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window. This is totaly unlistenable garbage that has no merrit whatsoever. This might well be the worst cd I've ever bought. I hope this will be the total extent of SINDEL's musical offerings. PUTRID!

Amazon review: I first heard this song on a CD of my local symphony orchestra performing with the harp orchestra. It was a very interesting experience, and I was curious to hear the song on my own. I have it on my iPod. It is a very pretty song and very well sung. It's a very nice tune, a well-done song, and it has the right amount of energy without being too intense.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this song. I don't like that it's so "pop" sounding and very loud, and it doesn't have much of the "melodic" elements of a song. The sound is too loud and the melody in the song is too generic, not very interesting or unique.

Amazon review: I have never liked this song or artist. And I don't like the over-the-top over-the-top sound. This is a very boring song, that has no substance to it at all. There are some nice elements, but the song is too repetitive and the tune is boring.

Amazon review: Absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence. An endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reasons why we need it, for exampl,e because of violent behaviour and conditions like eating disorders.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.
