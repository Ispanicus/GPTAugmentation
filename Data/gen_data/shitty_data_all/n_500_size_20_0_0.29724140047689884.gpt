Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I have to say, I love the song "Flex". I am not sure if I like the song for the music or the lyrics, but it is a good song. I like the way in a certain way the song is played. I especially like the way in the middle of the song they are playing it and then they stop.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The CD is very good. The production is excellent. It really is an amazing piece of work. The sound quality is excellent. The artwork is beautiful.

However, I can appreciate the music in this album.

Amazon review: The only negative thing I can say about this album is that it sounds like it was made in a studio with a mike that was made in a studio.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it gives it an artificial sound that is a little annoying. It is not a bad album, but it is not a stellar album either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD when I stopped by my local library to listen to it. It is a wonderful album.  I listened to the original recording in 1977, and I am still not sure why it was so fantastic.  The lyrics are great, and the music is great.  I'm not sure why it is so great.  At the time of its release, it had a sound that was very difficult to recreate.  It is a wonderful album, and I would recommend it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, but I think it could have had more variety in the songs. The theme of the album is "A New Day", which is the title track.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

What's the deal with the BGM? It sounds to me like the whole thing is a bunch of one note, low range/bass parts played on the organ with a very soft accompaniment. It's a bit like watching a classical organ concert where one of the soloing organists is playing a series of notes (low range/bass) on the organ, and the accompanist is playing soft, easy note playing, while the soloist plays more complex and difficult notes. It's a bit like listening to a classical organ concert where the organist is playing a series of notes (low range/bass) on the instrument, and the accompanist is playing a soft, easy note playing, while the soloist plays more complex and challenging notes. I wouldn't call it a BGM, nor would I call it any kind of classical music. I suppose it's a style, but I don't understand what it is.
How do you hear the soft accompaniment? Is it like the soft background noise that is sometimes associated with classical music? Or is it like the soft background noise that is usually associated with more modern, pop music on the radio? Or is it a mixture of both?

This is a style of music where the bass is very soft, and is used in place of a full sound to fill in low and midrange frequencies. It is like a low frequency drone that is played in soft, but does not sound like it. It's a BGM. It is a very common style of music on classical organs, like, for example, in the late 19th century, and it is used for many different reasons. It is also used by some classical musicians to emulate the sound of a harpsichord.
What I am referring to is the low range/bass part. The low bass is very soft and almost non-existent, and the high bass is also very

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: The Beatles' "Love Me Do" is a song that I have listened to a few times and still have not heard it again, yet I will probably hear it again!  When I was about fourteen, I heard it on the radio and was floored by the song.  It has stayed with me ever since.  I am still amazed every time I hear it, and think of the song all these years later!  I think this is a good song to teach children to sing, either to their first or fifth grade class.  In my younger days, I sang it from the time I was about six until I was thirteen.  I sang it at school every morning at a time when I was going to school, in the bathroom at lunch time, and later at the piano at the end of the day.  I made up songs from the Beatles as a child and I do not think it is a coincidence that I was given the opportunity to sing "Love Me Do" as a gift to my mother when she became my mom.  My mom was a strong woman and this song has been with me through all the years and is now a part of me.  This song is a very good song to tell a story with, such as "The Night Before Christmas", "The Christmas tree lighting ceremony", "The Christmas song"  and many others.  It is also a good song for a story to sing to a child who is lonely or not feeling well.  I have been known to sing this song when my mother is not home.  I also sing it when I am teaching children to read.  I don't want to get the children to learn the song too well, so I let them sing it together as a whole class at a time when it is appropriate for everyone to be together.  I have sung it with children from all over the world and it is always exciting to see them all smile and clap their little hands after singing the song.  The first time I saw a four year old in the audience clapping his or her hands after singing the song, I got so excited I had to clap!  It is a good song to sing at the beginning of a school year to get children excited about the year ahead.  For this reason, I also sing it in my classroom at the beginning of each school year.  It is also a great song to sing in a family where everyone is together to celebrate a new year, whether it be a birthday, anniversary, or Christmas.  I would recommend this song to either young or older children.  If you sing it to your child, please use this sentence after the song as a review:  "Wow, this is awesome!  I didn't know that this song was so great!"   
I would also recommend this song to the parents of my students, including the parents of my husband's children!  It is great to sing with your child and it gets you in the mood to play with them. 
I would like to thank you for your time and consideration regarding my song selection.  If you have any questions about this, please feel free to contact me.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon author: I'm going to guess that this song is about "the man I'm gonna marry".  I have a feeling that this is some sort of a breakup song.  I like it, but I have a feeling that it's just a little bit too depressing for me.  2 stars.

Amazon book review: This is actually one of my favorite albums of all time.  I think it's because it is really simple and not overproduced.  It's got a good beat to it but it's not overly overproduced like some of the other albums.  So I don't know if it's simple or not.  I'd say it's not overproduced, but it's definitely not simple.  I think I'll probably listen to it again when I'm bored though.  3 stars.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.

The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review:  The only good thing I can say about this album is that it is not an "all-star" version of a pop band.  The best tracks are the three or four that are "hit" songs.  My favorite tracks are the ones that are not hit songs.  The rest is not worth listening to.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I think this album was a huge disappointment, for two reasons:  1. The quality of the songs are not up to par with the music scene in the 90's.  2.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
