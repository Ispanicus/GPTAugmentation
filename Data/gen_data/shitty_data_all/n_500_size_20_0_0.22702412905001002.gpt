Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: I have been listening to her for decades and she still keeps me guessing. I like her, she is a good artist, but in the end she is just a singer who has been given a good amount of time and has put out a few CDs, it is not enough to make her a "legend". She is a great singer and a great artist, but she is not the next Carole King, she is not the next Aretha Franklin, so she has no right to be considered a "legend". I would rather listen to one of the greats, like Aretha, John Cowsins, Johnny Tillotson, etc.

Amazon review: I think everyone has someone who is very special to them, and I think that is the main reason why we listen to so many songs. Listening to songs is like looking at pictures of anyone you know who is very special to you. The difference is that the picture is not as clear as when you look at a piece of music. Just like when you look at a picture of your special someone, you can't tell if it is a good picture of them or it could be a picture of any person you know.

Amazon review: When I was about 11 I went to the library to borrow a book. The librarian was like "you have to be 18 to borrow a book, but if you're under 18 you are not allowed to borrow a book". So I asked if I could borrow it, and she said "yes, but you'll have to return it when you're 18". So I told her I was under 18 and she said "well, you can't borrow books from the library, and you're not allowed to even borrow books from the city library because you're not allowed to be in the city library". So I asked her if she was going to give me a book when I turned 18 and she said no. So I told her I was going to go to school, and she said "well, you can't go to school until you're 18 because you're not allowed to be in the city library, and you have to be in the city library to be in school". So I was like why can't I go to school? "because you're not allowed to be in the city library". So I asked why she said I was not allowed to be in the city library, and she said "because you're not allowed to be in the city library". So then I told her that I was from the city. She said she had no idea who I was, and she said "you can't go to school until you're 18". So I told her that I was a city kid who didn't go to school. She said "well, you don't have a birth certificate, and you can't go to school until you're 18". So I asked her if she was going to give me a book from the city library when I turned 18, and she said no, but she would have to. So I asked her how she would have to do that, and she said "well, you can't go to the city library until you're 18, and you are not allowed to go to the city library until you're 18, so you can't go to school until you're 18". So I asked again why she said she didn't have a birth certificate, and she said "because you're not allowed to. You're not allowed to go to school until you're 18". So I said "but I'm not allowed to go to school until I'm 18, and I'm from the city". She said "well, you're not allowed to go to school until you're 18". So I asked again why she didn't have a birth certificate, and she said "because you can't go to school until you're 18". So I'm like "what do I have to do to get a birth certificate?" "I'm not allowed to go to school until I'm 18". So I asked her why she said I can't go to school until I'm 18, and she said "because you're not allowed to go to school until you're 18". So then I said "why are you telling me what I can or cannot do, and you're telling me that I'm not allowed to go to school until I'm 18? I'm from the city". So she said "well, you don't have a birth certificate, you can't go to school until you're 18". So I asked why she said I can't go to school until I'm 18, until I'm not allowed to go to school, she said "you're not allowed to go to school until you're 18 because you're not allowed to go to school until you're 18". So she said she didn't have a birth certificate, and she said I can't go to school until I'm 18. So I told her I'm not allowed to go to school until I'm 18. She said "because you're not allowed to go to school until you're an adult". So then I asked her what I'm allowed to do. She said "you can't go to school until you're 18, you're not allowed to have a birth certificate", and she said "because you're not allowed to go to school until 18, which means you can't go to school, and you're not allowed to have a birth certificate. So you'll have to find a way to get one". So then I said "what do I have to do to get a birth certificate", and she said "well, you can't go to school until you turn 18 because you're not allowed to go to school until you turn 18". So then I said "what do I have to do until I'm 18?". She said "well, you're not allowed to go to school until 18, and you're not allowed to have a birth certificate until 18, because you're not allowed to go to school until 18, and you're never allowed to have a birth certificate. So you'll have to find a birth certificate". So then I asked

I agree with the other reviewers. I was not dissapointed in the song selection. I always like the choice that they have for songs. For example, they have an amazing song called "Bubblegum" on the radio everyday. I have listened to it on my drive home. It's a great song.

But, the same can't be said for every song on the show.

I think the song selection is very good. I like the different types of songs they have. I think that's the best thing about this show. They have some old school, some modern, some old school with some new school in there.

I don't have a problem with the song choices. I think they did a great job.

I don't think the show is the same as it was back in the day. I don't know if it was on the air for a while or not. I think the show was on the air for a while back then.

I think it is better than the first season, but I don't think it is the best season. I think that's the best part of the show. I think the second season has a lot of new things that they changed on the show.

I don't think the song choice is a problem. I don't think it is the best thing about the show. I think if you compare the shows, the songs are very similar.

I think the show is great. It is different from the old shows.

I think it is not a good show. I think the songs are great and I like the choice they have for songs. I think the show is a great show.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I have not had a good experience with this product, it is disappointing.  One day I was going to buy this, and when I got to the checkout, I found that we were not allowed to have PayPal as a payment option, so I went to other payment options. I was then asked for my card info, and I was told that it was not a valid credit card. I then discovered that I had put in my social security number and birth date on my debit card.  I was then given this option, "We can either send you a different product, or we will cancel your order and refund the money, or we will ship your order to you with a message asking you to contact us with the exact details of your credit card or debit card." I choose the second option. I then was told that the product I had paid for was being cancelled. When I asked why, the company stated that they have the right to cancel my order if they feel it is necessary. Even though they canceled my order, I felt that it was because they wanted to make a statement.  I also feel that this company is trying to scam me.  I have never had a good experience with them, when I am able to complete a purchase, it is usually a 5-star experience. I am very disappointed with this product, and would not recommend this company to anyone, I will be changing my purchasing preferences to avoid them in the future.  If anyone has any suggestions, please do not hesitate to share. Very disapointed.  Thanks.

Amazon review
This is a great release by Switchfoot.  It's a very good CD, but I do have a few minor gripes, to begin.  Number 1 - I don't understand why they didn't just put an album out of the box.  I think it would have been a lot better for the band and the fans.  Number 2- The song times are all over the place.  The song from "I Can't Help Myself" is WAY too fast for the album, and the album is WAY too slow.  The song from "You Can't Stop the Beat" is WAY too slow, and the album is WAY too fast.  Number 3- The song from "No One Else Can" is WAY too fast, and the album is WAY too slow.  In fact, I don't really know why they put so much emphasis on the songs from this album.  If you listen to the album, you'll notice the songs from the album are WAY too fast, and the songs from this album are WAY too slow.  I think this album is fine, but I think they could have done away with the songs from this album.  There are only 7 songs on the album, and only 3 of them are from the album.  I understand that they're trying to make a statement, but the 3 songs from the album are WAY TOO MUCH.  The album is only 2 songs long.  I hope that they put a CD out of the box.  They could have done that, and I would have been happy with that because the album would be shorter.  I hope that they put a CD out of the box, and come out with a CD called "The Good Stuff".  I think it would have been a lot better for the band and fans to do away with the songs from the album, and release a CD with the songs from the album.  I think that would have been a much better way to make a statement.  I'm not sure why they didn't do that.  So, I have a few minor gripes with this CD.  Number 4 - The songs about God don't make sense.  Number 5 - The

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I actually have never heard this song before but I love it. It's a beautiful song with so much emotion. It's a little dated now but still holds true to what I love about it. When I first started listening it felt like I was singing along to it, which was really nice. I'm sad that it's out of style and I don't feel the need to purchase it.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I usually hate songs that I purchase off Amazon. But this one was pretty decent. I would say it's a 90/10 but I don't know if that's the right way to compare it. It sounds like a 90/10 song but it isn't. It's a little dull, but I think that's because it's a little too long. I'll give it a shot though. It's got a lot of heart and a lot of passion.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

I loved "The Redeeming quality of Redman's music is the fact that it manages to be fresh, and it manages to do something that no other musician has done in the pop genre.... his style is uniquely his own. His lyrics are also uniquely his own and they aren't formulaic. And I think that's what makes Redman's music so special and different from other artists, and makes it so timeless. Redman was obviously ahead of his time.  His style is so unique and unique.  His music is so hip, and he's got a great voice.  He's a great lyricist
