Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I just can't get into the latest Taylor Swift. She is not even catchy. I'm not saying the song is bad. But I just don't get it. I am not saying I don't like this album, but it is just not catchy. Now I'm not saying she can't get a hit on the radio, but she doesn't have a great song. Like the first song has a great hook, and she makes the song work, but the other songs are just boring. I don't get this. I'm not saying it's bad, but I just don't get it.

Amazon review: My daughter was diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease about a year ago. In the beginning, I was more concerned with the disease than the treatment. Her doctor said that she may not live past the age of 18, but that she could live with the disease. I was worried, but didn't know what else to do. I had been a diabetic for 25 years, and the problem with my kidneys was not something I could be cured of. I decided to go back to the doctor and ask him if there is anything else that he can do to help her. The doctor said that they are not very good at dealing with dialysis and that it could be the last treatment. Because of the way I feel about her dying, I decided to take my daughter to the hospital for the first time. I knew she was strong, but I didn't know how strong she was. I was told that she would be there for the next few days and that the doctor would call me if she had any problems. She's been a fighter all her life and she has a will to live. She has been under the care of a dialysis nurse and a dialysis technician. The problem is that she's getting dialysis three times a week. Once every other day, and once every three days. The treatment takes 1 hour, and it's really tiring. I'm going to miss her terribly. If I couldn't be with her during the day, I would miss her the most during the night. I miss her so much that I have decided to donate the money that I have to the family for the cost of the treatment. I was given a certificate saying I donate to the hospital. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help and support. I am very glad that I decided to make this donation because it will help so many people who are in need. Please pass my message on to others. Thank you.

Amazon review: I bought the album after hearing it on the radio. I like the fact that it is a collection of songs from all over the world.

The album is over 3 hours long and I was hoping that it would be an album that would be enjoyable to listen to for the whole time.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the music of the band "California." I love their early stuff, especially "California's Gold."  Then, for a short time, I was a fan of the dark, gothic, and sad, dark, gothic, and sad music of "Flaming Lips."  But now I'm a fan of their newer stuff, especially "Laughing Gas."  I listen to their latest CD, Desperate Measures, every now and then.  It's a fun listen.  I'm not a fan of their earlier stuff, and I don't listen to any of their newer stuff.  But I also don't like any of their new music.  This is one of those weird things, when I am a fan of one band, I totally hate another band, and vice versa.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure that this is the band's swan song.  I don't know what to think.  I guess I'm just a fan of the new stuff better than the old stuff, I guess.  Anyway, I was happy to see that the CD had 12 songs, and that they had a second CD, that had a few more songs.  It is just not all there.  But I was happy to get a free CD with no shipping charge.

Amazon review: This CD is great.  I bought this CD back in the fall of 2009 and I had been wanting to get it back for a few months.  I have been a fan of their music for a long time and I was excited to see that they were still around.  I just didn't know what to expect, I was a little worried that they might all go away.  I was very happy to see that they were still around and that their music was still good.  I have listened to a few of their CDs that I have gotten from their website and I found them to be very good.  I like the sound quality, the lyrics are not bad and I like their songs.  I think I will be buying their album again soon.  As for their music, I like it.  I have liked their music since I was a teenager.  I have been a fan of Lady Gaga for a very long time.  When I first heard "Born This Way" and "The Fame," I thought it was great.  Then they released "Just Dance" and I thought it was great.  Then they released "Bad Romance" and I thought it was great.  And then they released "Bad Romance 2" and I thought it was great.  Then they released "Just Dance 2" and I thought it was great.  Then they released "The Fame" and I thought it was great.  I have been a fan of Lady Gaga since I was a teenager and I thought they were great.  But I thought the new music was just not that good.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of The Beatles since I was in high school. I was a huge Beatles fan before I even knew that they were a band.  So when I found out that they were doing a new record, I felt like the only person who didn't know who they were.  I was devastated.  This one is better than the last Beatles record, but I was still disappointed. I bought it for myself because I love the Beatles and bought it for my husband. He is a huge Beatles fan and he wanted to listen to it so he could tell us about it.  As you can tell by the title, I was wrong.  The Beatles had to create a new album just for themselves.  It's called the "Beatles" and I am going to find out why they did this. I think the song "Eleanor Rigby" was the best of all of them, but they couldn't make a new album just for themselves.

Amazon review: I am a Beatles fan, but I was surprised by how well the Beatles did on this album.  This album rocks.  I am looking forward to the next one, but I know it will be better than this one.  I wonder how many people that have not even heard this one will buy it because of how good it is.  I wonder how many people will think that it is going to be a terrible album because I am going to say to them "I am a Beatles fan who is disappointed by this album.  It is too good to be true."  I'm going to be honest.  I really do not like this album.  I don't like the Beatles as a band, I just like their music.  I really don't like this album.  I'm not saying the Beatles should have done another one.  I'm just saying that this record was better than their first album.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album.  I just didn't know what to expect.  When I first got it, and listened to it, I was very surprised by how good it was.  I really liked a lot of the stuff on it. Not everything, but I liked a lot.  I was disappointed when I got it because I thought it was going to be worse than the last one.  I thought they were going to repeat everything that they did on their last album, just try to make it even better.  I was wrong.  It is a very good album.  I can't wait to get the next one.  I will give it 4 stars because I really like the last album.  I would like to hear more stuff from them.  I'll be sure to tell you when I do.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's not hard to see where you're coming from. I've never seen much of the album and hadn't heard much of any songs off of it, so I had a hard time trying to understand how people could think the album is awful. It's not like the songs were horrible, they're just not that good. I could say the same about his other work. While I understand that he's had a lot of success, I didn't think he would stoop to writing music like this. I'm glad I found this review and I'll definitely buy the single.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

I know it's not that good, it's just not worth $12.  I think it's a waste.  I mean, there were some good songs on the previous CD, but the lyrics just sucked, and it was just way too long.  I think a CD with a shorter length would have been better, and I think the song selection was better.  I think the new CD is good, but the song selection is not as good.

Amazon customer review:
I've been using Amazon Music for years and I've had many good experiences. I've had songs played on my kindle, my ipod, my iphone, and my MP3 player. The only time a song on Amazon doesn't show up on my ipod, iPod or MP3 player is when I'm on my computer and I'm connected to the internet. I'll get some songs when I'm not connected to the internet. I've downloaded songs from the Music section and I've listened to them. I've never been charged for a song I did not request. I've never had a song I downloaded from the music section not show up on my ipod, ipod, MP3 player, or kindle. No matter how many songs I downloaded off of the Amazon store, I always get the ones that I've requested. I've downloaded several songs off of the Amazon website, and I've listened to them. I've never had a song I downloaded off of the Amazon website not show up on my ipod, ipod, MP3 player or kindle. You can get the songs that you ask for as long as you're connected to the internet.  I'm very satisfied with the service that I've received from Amazon.  I recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: The first thing that came to me was, I thought about what the song was about. It's like a story that I have been telling myself. It's the story of the struggle of not wanting to say no, to really say no. It's the story of people who have a hard time saying no to people they like or people who are just trying to make a living, and you feel like you have to do more than a job to say, "I like you, but I have to go." And it's a struggle, because there are so many other things you want to do. And it's just like, "I like you, you're nice, I think about you all the time, but I have to go."

Amazon review: I was an instant sell-out on this album. I wasn't a Korn fan, but I loved this album, and I was eager to hear a new one. I couldn't get into it the first time around, but I fell in love with it after the third time. The songs are catchy, the guitar solos on "Wish I Was Dead" are the best I've ever heard. The lyrics are great and the band never sounded more together. It has a sound that reminds me of the early Stones. Korn is still my favorite band, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.
