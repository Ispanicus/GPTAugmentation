Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

There are very few songs worth buying on the album and most of them are not even in the album. The album is one big collection of songs that are mostly forgettable and uninteresting.

I've been listening to the album on repeat for the past 3 weeks now. I only started getting into the album about a week before I started writing this review. I was a fan of the band in the beginning for their early releases, but I've lost all faith in them the past few years. When I first heard their new album I was surprised at how much I loved the first two songs, but I was really disappointed with the rest of the album.

I've been trying to get my hands on their new album for months now, but I can't find it anywhere. I've bought all of their old albums from the first two years of their career, but I don't know where to go next. I'm not sure if I'd buy this album if it were available to buy.

Overall: I'm sure this album will be good for a lot of people, but it's really not for me. I've had a couple of the songs on repeat for the past 3 weeks now, and I find myself getting more and more bored with them. I don't think this album is worth the money.

I don't really know what to say about this album. I like most of the songs on there, but I don't like the fact that there is a lot of filler songs on the album. I was really hoping that this album would be different, but I was really disappointed in this album.

Although this album isn't bad. It has the right amount of songs. And I could definitely say that this album has the right amount of songs. If

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

Amazon review: I really liked this song during the "Homeland" TV series.  It definitely felt like a piece of music that the TV series was trying to do.  I think the song could have been done with some more variety in the lyrics.  It's not a song you can sing a hundred times and get the same message across.  It's just that it's a different story in each iteration of the song.  It's just that it's a different story.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

###
Amazon review: I love listening to music I truly enjoy hearing different styles of music. I had to laugh when I found out that in order to save on shipping costs, Amazon is selling my album for a penny and the CD is selling for $1.00. I thought I was being ripped off but I am guessing it is the truth. I purchased the album to support my favorite artist. I am not a fan of country music but I love country music. I have purchased a collection of country music to support my favorite artists. I hope that this album makes me a fan of Billy Currington and his newest CD "For those who wait." I have tried to buy his albums for several years and have had to wait for the record company to release it. I am so glad I found out that you can purchase Billy Currington's new CD and support the artist. I am glad I have found out that you can purchase his album for a dollar and support the artist.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

This album was bought for my daughter that is not yet 21. The songs are from her mother's favorite artists.
My daughter listens to the station that this album came from and loves it. She likes all the songs, but she especially likes the songs that her mother likes and that she sings along with.

I would recommend this album to anyone that likes to listen to music and enjoy it. I would recommend this to others that are not as lucky to have their mothers and grandmothers to listen to their favorite songs with them.

I purchased this album because my mother loves it and she listens to it everyday. I am not sure how I feel about it because I feel like it is not as good as it could be.

I listen to this album for my daughter because she sings it all the time. It is a great album for younger children as well as older children. My daughter loves it and does not get upset with it even when I don't sing along to it.

This album has a nice mix of music. When I listen to it, I just listen to the songs that my mother likes and my daughter likes. I can't wait to listen to it with my daughter and my mother. I would recommend this to anyone that likes to listen to music.

I love my mother, and she loves me. She is the only one that has never failed to tell me that I am the best girl she has ever known. I wish my mother could have this album. She would love to listen to it with us and to know that I have her favorite songs.

This is a great album for your mom and dad to listen to together. It has songs that are your mother's favorites and songs that are her favorites. My mother loved the songs in this album and she really likes singing and playing the piano. I know my mom would have loved this album.

This is a great album for your mom and dad to enjoy together. It has songs that are your mother's favorites and songs that she loves to sing along with. My mother loved the songs in this album and she really likes singing. I know my mother would have loved this album.

Amazon review: This is a song about giving up on love, but I haven't given up on love.  I've tried to get some perspective on it, but I'm still too young to understand it.  I'm a little older than this song was written for.  I don't think of myself as a person who gives up on love.  I think of myself as a person who still has hope.  I feel like this song just wants me to feel like I'm giving up on love, so I can feel like I'm giving up on love.  I don't feel like giving up on love, so I just feel like the song is being so mean to me, and that it's just a way to get me to give up on love, so I can feel more like I'm giving up on love.  It's not that I want to give up on love - I'm just not sure how to get to the place where I do - and if I do get there.  It's not that I'm giving up on love - I just don't know what to do to get to that place where I do.  I think that this song is about making me feel like I'm giving up on love, so I can get to the place where I am.  And if I get there, I can give up on love.  But I don't know how to get to that place where I am.  It's almost like the song is talking to me and says I'm giving up on love, so I can get to that place, but the song doesn't stop talking to me and giving me advice to get to that place.  It's almost like I'm the "girl" in this song.  The song is saying if I give up on love, I'll always be the "girl" in the song.  And if I get to that place, I'll be the "boy" in the song.  If I give up on love, I'll be the "girl" in the song.  If I get to that place, I'll be the "boy" in this song.  If I give up on love, I'll be the song.  And if I get to that place, I'll feel like I'm giving up on love.  But I don't know what to do to get to that place where I am.

I don't think it's very nice to take someone's life.  I don't think it's very nice to take someone's time.  I don't like that.  And I don't like that the music is loud.  Is the music loud enough that if someone was in here, they'd know when they were being intrusive by being able to hear the music so loud?  And so that everyone else in the house could sleep?  And I don't like that the lyrics are about making someone feel guilty.  And I don't like that the lyrics are about cutting someone's hair out.  And I don't like that the lyrics are about how they're not going to care anymore.  And I don't like the song.  I don't like the song.  I don't like this song.  I don't like this song.

Well, I'm not sure how many of you have heard this song before, and I'm not sure how many of you have heard this song before either.  It's a pretty good song, and I don't think most people would disagree with that assessment, but this isn't the version of this song that I'm familiar with.  The version I'm familiar with isn't the version I'm familiar with because I'm familiar with the original.  I've never heard this song played in that way before, and I've never heard it played this way before.  It's not bad though, it's just not the best version of this song that I've heard.  I don't think this song is a good seller either, and I don't think it's a great seller either.  It's not a great song, but it's not a bad song either, and it's not the worst song either, and it's not the best song either so I don't know why people don't like it.  I don't know why people don't like it.  I wish I knew.  It really is an excellent song though.  The lyrics are well done, and the melody is amazing.  I really like this song well done.  The arrangement is not well done.  The tempo is fast, and the vocals are not well done.  You would think that with this song, these things were a given, but they're not.  I think that you should be able to tell this is the work of a competent musician, musician, arranger, and musician, but you can't tell those things by listening to this song.  The vocal recording is good, but the rhythm track is not good.  I think it's the wrong song for this.  The original song is better.  I think this version is pretty good, but not great.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
