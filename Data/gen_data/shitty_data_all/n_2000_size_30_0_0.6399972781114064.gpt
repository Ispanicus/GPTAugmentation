I love this cd, it is just as amazing as I had expected. it is awsome. It is good no matter what type of music you usually listen to. It is a combinaiton or hip hop, and metal. it is an awsome combination. It is funny, adn serious. so nomatter wht your mood is you will enjoy it. I think that this cd has just made my month.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Amazon review: A very good CD and worth the money. The beats are very well done. The vocals are good also. The beats are amazing. The song that really impressed me was the song 'Sister'. I am really not a fan of the kind of music I listen to and this music is so good I think I have to add it to my playlist. I cannot praise this CD enough. It is definately worth the money.

Amazon review: I think I might be the only person who likes this album and it's probably because I am not a fan of Jackyls music. I actually like 'Lifetime' a lot, but this album is just plain boring. It sounds like a lot of people are just sitting around and recording the same songs over and over and over again. I get the feeling that there is no creativity or anything on this album. I wish it was a bit different. But for a lot of people I think of this album as a good "treat". It is a good album that I would recommend to anyone who buys one.

Amazon review: Man this album is really good. there is no doubt about that. I believe that the Jackyls cd is worth buying but I really do not think it is worth the money. The only thing that I really like is the songs on the cd and the beats. The lyrics are not that good. The beats are good. The beats just lack creativity. The beats are very good. The beats are very similar so I think I have to use one of the songs to make up for the song that is missing. I really don't think that the artist is trying to make a good cd. I really don't think that he is making a good cd. The beats are too similar. That's all I can say.

Personally I wouldn't take this for free.  Add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thieves, cop killers, drug addicts and ex cons.

Amazon review: I have listened to "All i have to do is dream" and I have to say, I liked it.  I am not a big fan of this artist, but, I did like the song.  It is well written and is very catchy.  I do miss the old days however.  I guess back then, the music was more personal and more real.  And that's what this song is, a real song.  I liked it.  I have read where some say it is an example of racism, but I wouldn't know anything about that.  I still remember my grandma telling me about a black man who lived in her neighborhood.  I would sit on my front porch and watch him when I was five years old and I can't even begin to imagine what it must have been like to have a father who was from Africa.  I just remember being a kid, and wanting to see what it was like to be a black man.  In my opinion, this is an example of the real spirit of America.

This song is so repetitive it has become an irritating noise in my head.  I have purchased two of his CDs and I must say I would not buy the third.  I feel that he has left his audience behind with his music.  It makes me feel like I am listening to music that is not for me.  I am not sure if he is a "celebrity" of some sort or what.  I just find it to be a waste of time.  I just wish that he would release an album that is a true representation of his music.  I do not consider myself a racist, but I do think that he is, and I can't help the fact that he is able to sell CDs.

In a world where music and sound are being used to make people more connected and socially responsible, an album like Visions of Light by Matthew West may seem like a throwback. But West's music is far from being nostalgic. The artist is an ardent adherent of the spiritual and metaphysical traditions of the Christian faith, and his music is a reflection of the life and teachings of Jesus.

West's first album, Visions of Light, is a collection of traditional songs and new compositions. It shows the artist's love for God's creation, which he calls "the great orchestra of the universe." The album also includes some songs with a Christian message, like "The Great Physician," "Ave Maria," and "I Believe" (which is accompanied by a spoken prayer). The album was recorded by West at his home studio and features a variety of musical artists, including some of his friends from the Christian hip-hop group, the Fiery Cross.

"There's no doubt that the songs on this album are beautiful, but they're not what I wanted to be a musician or a Christian musician to be," West told the Christian Post. "I wanted to be a musician for the Kingdom of God. I wanted to write songs with God in mind, because I know that music is God's instrument. And I believe that the songs on this album are my way of expressing that sentiment."

West, who has a degree in music from the University of Texas-Austin, first started to explore his Christian faith in college. He said his first song was written about six years

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: While clearly a tremendous technical achievement, this 2CD set is at the same time ranging and intimate in its expression - both explosive and contemplative. I love it!

Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

Amazon review:  I just discovered this album and I absolutely love it.  This is exactly what I needed after getting my fill of Bikkyt.  This album is a perfect mix of the raw energy of Bikkyt mixed with the mellow, yet funky, touch of the Bikkyt sound.  I just want to thank you, Random House, for the opportunity to review this album.  It's probably the best thing Random House has ever done.   It's a wonderful mix of all my music tastes.  The only thing that could make this better is if you were to add a little bit of Bikkyt and some more of the Bikkyt sound.  That being said, it doesn't matter because this is still my favorite album I've ever heard.   I think you should put out more of this type of stuff. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  It has some of the best drumming I've heard in a long, long time.  The guitar work is off the charts.  It has something for everyone.  The vocals are excellent.  I wish they'd let me review more of their stuff (even though I have heard most of it).   This album is a must for any Bikkyt fan.   I'm a huge fan of the whole band.  I've been watching their tour the past few months and this is one of the albums that they don't really play.   It's just like they don't have the right songs yet.  I think they should just put out one or two singles and then try to get them on the tour.   It's a good album though.   It's an album that can stand on its own.  It can stand by itself.  It's also probably my favorite album they've ever put out.   I will definitely buy and listen to more of it.  It's the best album they've ever put out.   They really have done something here.   It's a great album.   You can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: Great movie, great soundtrack. I've always loved Shinedown and was happy to see them doing another album.

Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".

Amazon review: The first thing I would say after listening to this album is that it is not for everyone.  I do not think that this album is for everyone.  However for those people that are a fan of the old school hip hop (I am not sure if this means that this is for people who rap like the "gangsta" rap of the past) this album is a good listen.  The second thing is that this album is not for everyone.  Some people will love it and some will hate it.  Either way, this album should be listened to by people who love the old school hip hop sound.  This album definitely does not have the best beats but it does have a great flow.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've come to appreciate the music of the Posies more and more with each passing release. In 2008, I was on the edge of my seat with the release of their brilliant 7" on 4AD Records.
This album, however, was a bit different for me. While I like their previous releases, I was not as excited by this release, it really didn't grab me like it should have.
I do have to say that I do not think that this album is a bad album. On the contrary, I think it's a very good album, and it's worth a listen.
I do not recommend this album for the casual listener, but more so for the true fan. The more you know about this artist, the more you will appreciate this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album even if you are not a fan of the Posies.  There's not much to say here except for the fact that the sound is great.  The vocals are strong.  The instrumentals are not really my thing, but I like them because it's not your typical hip hop album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, this is a very good album.  I don't know if it is a "good" album or not.  It's not a "bad" album, it's just that sometimes I don't care for the beats that are used in the album.  But I do enjoy the production.  The album feels like it has some real soul in it. I love the guitar solos at the end of the album. I love the instrumentals like "Tear Down This Wall" and "The Longest Night".  I love the vocals on this album.  I think the vocals on this album are as good as anything from the Posies and are way better.  I do not have much to say about the instrumentals on this album.  I think that the instrumentals are OK but not as good as the vocals.  I also think that the instrumentals do not have as much going on as the main vocals.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent album, and even the title track is great.  I had a hard time liking AFI's new album, but this is actually an improvement.  The album has a nice flow to it and the vocals are great.  It's a nice alternative album.  You will have to give this album a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a bit different from AFI's previous albums.  I think that this album is best when compared to AFI's previous releases.  The instrumentals are not as good as AFI's past albums.  The production is also a bit different with this album.  The songs are a lot slower than AFI's past efforts.  The instruments are all played by members of the Posies.  I'm not sure if I like this album or not, but I think that it's worth a listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I saw this album in a store as a gift for my mom.  I had heard of the Posies before and I knew that they had some good instrumentals.  I had heard about this album before, but I didn't think too much of it.  I'm glad that I listened to it.  This album is a good listen and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the instrumentals on this album.  The songs are a little slower and I have to say that the instrumentals are a bit slow.  I don't think that it's a bad album, but I think that it's not a very good album.  It's the kind of album that you would probably enjoy listening to at some point but will probably not listen to many times.

When I first heard she's a singer from England I couldn't believe it, she's a singer that needs to go back to the days they used to sing with a band and get her head out of her ass. She's not a singer. She's a rambling woman who has a voice that sounds like she hasn't slept in 2 days. Her songs are more like the ones you hear on the radio with random noise added.

Amazon review: My wife and I were listening to this song and we decided to download it as a ringtone. We listen to the songs at work (I'm a software engineer) and we like to play them on our cell phones. When we went into the store, we decided to buy this song. The first thing we did was to download it and listen to it. We loved it. The second thing we did was to put it on our phones. We have two phones, one a Motorola and the other a Nokia. We have two mp3 players, the Motorola one and the Nokia one. We love mp3 players. Well, we love them a little more than the cell phones. So, when we got home from the store, our Nokia was singing the song and our Motorola was making crazy noises.  It was not a good thing.  The Nokia was singing the song and the Motorola was making crazy noises.  We don't have a problem when a song is on the Motorola. But when it is on the Nokia, we have a problem.  So, we took the Nokia back to the store and the lady that sold us the Nokia was a little upset with me because our Nokia was making crazy noises. I explained to her that our Motorola was singing the song and she said that our Motorola was making crazy noises because of the song that we bought.  Well, now we have to go back to the store and get the Nokia. We really don't want to do that. It is a song we really don't like (I can't remember the name of it).  I think that is why it is on our cell phones.  We want to play this song on the Motorola, but not on our cell phones.  We are going to try to get another one of those cell phones.  I don't know if it will work. We are not sure, but we are going to try it. This song is really bad.  It is terrible.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time.

This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: I love the classic Moonglows recordings.  So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not Really Chistmas-y, just 12 1/2 minutes of repetitive and tedious listening. Thankfully, it was free, otherwise I'd have wanted my money back.

Amazon review: Another one of those CDs I've listened to at least a dozen times, I'm just waiting for the day I stumble upon this one in a store.  I'm sorry, but I cannot find the words to describe how much I love this CD.  I love the way it sounds, the way it makes you feel, and the fact that I don't have to listen to it at all just makes it that much better.  The lyrics are good too!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a great acoustic CD that takes you back to the old days.  It is very soothing.  Every single song is a wonderful mixture of acoustic and electric, just like this album.  I just love all the songs here, and the music just flows in all the right places.  It is very relaxing, even though I don't necessarily get a lot of sleep.  My two favorite songs are "I Was Wrong" and "Pig in the Middle."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the Moonglows, but I think this one is a bit of a let down.  The songs are OK, but the musicians are just too busy.  I listened to this in the car and it was like I was in a movie.  The songs are really enjoyable, and I like the lyrics, but the musical arrangements are a bit too busy for me.  I also wish the songs had a little more of a sense of melody, without the songs having to be so repetitive.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album deserves at least a "very good" rating.  It has so many quality songs, and several of the tracks are quite good.  I love the cover art and I love all the songs.  It's a good album for family and alone time, but for a party or a night out I'd recommend you listen to one of the songs as background music.  The music is very well done, and the lyrics are excellent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I had been trying to find a CD with a song by the Moonglows, and I thought I had found it in this album.  But after listening to this album, I realized the song is by Billy Strayhorn and not the Moonglows.  This album is great!  The songs are all different, and the musicianship is excellent.  I like how the songs are arranged and the arrangements are very good.  I really like the songs, they are all very good.  I like the lyrics too.  So I will love this album.  I will be buying more albums from this company.  I really like this one very much.

Amazon review: The title track on this album is "One Minute Man" and it's a very good song.  It's a great cover of a song by the Moonglows.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: I just did a search on "Oasis" and this album popped up in a bunch of entries.  Maybe I was wrong, but this is the first one that came up.  I guess if you like this album, you've been on the internet a while, or maybe it's just a coincidence.  I didn't even know the band was still active, so I guess it's not a bad album.  I don't think it was ever on any major pop radio stations, but I wouldn't say it was a bad album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album off and on, and I've grown to like it.  Maybe I just have a hard time listening to this kind of music.  I've got other stuff that I listen to.  Like the Beatles, and I love them, but I'm not a huge Beatles fan.  I think this album is great, but I don't really know why.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is so boring that it almost sounds like a "preview" of Oasis.  It's just a bunch of songs from this period that sound like they could be on a commercial pop radio station that's playing "best of" type of stuff, which they are, just not Oasis.  The worst song is "New Day".  The second worst is "The Boy With The Thorn In His Side".  I'm not really sure what this album is trying to accomplish.  I didn't really care for this album much, but I guess I'm probably in the minority.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have this album and I really don't understand the hype.  I really don't like it, it just seems like a bunch of songs that sound like they were recorded in a studio with really cheap equipment.  It doesn't really make sense when you watch some of the videos of the songs.  I would have preferred to have this album with the one song I liked on it, but I guess the hype is just too much.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a little weird, but it's really good.  It's the song "The Day I Taught The World To Fly" that really makes me like this album, but it's the rest of the songs that really drive it home that made me wish I knew more about the band before buying this album.  The one negative thing I can say about this album is that it sounds a little dated.  Like the songs "New Day" and "The Boy With The Thorn In His Side" sound like they could be from an older album than this one, or at least the sound of the music sounds like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've had this album for a while and I really don't like it.  It's not bad, but I don't really know why people are so into it.  I think it's just that it's the first Oasis album I've heard, and I don't really know much about the band.  I like some of the other albums I've heard, but I don't really know if I'd like most of them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've got this album and I don't like it.  It's okay, but I don't like it.  I guess the album was released in '96 and I feel like I've heard a lot of the songs before.  I would have preferred to have it with the one song I liked on it, but I guess the hype was just too much.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review of: This album is average, really.  I'm not really sure what it's trying to accomplish.  Maybe I should have just bought the first Oasis album, "Be Here Now", that was released in 1992.  Anyway, it's okay, but I just don't like it.

Amazon review: This album is the one where they really start to sound more like The Beatles.  This is the first album where they sound like they're on a pop radio station.

There's not much variety, but there's a couple of songs that I like.

Amazon review: I just finished watching "Philadelphia". The movie-one of the most moving (and sad) movies I've ever seen. Not a dry eye in the house with this one! The song (Neil Young)- Perhaps one of the most beautiful and pensive love songs I've ever heard. I want to own that song (not necessarily the entire soundtrack).

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: There's a couple of good things about this song.  First, it has a very beautiful and unique vocal quality.  It's not the typical female whiney voice for a gospel song, but rather a sweet and strong soprano.  The second positive thing (and the thing that I liked the most) is that it is a very emotional and touching song.  It's very reminiscent of the music of the greats like Aretha Franklin (I'm not quite sure why she chose the name "Aretha", but whatever) or The Temptations.  There's a very real and very human emotion here that is very difficult to pull off in a more upbeat or pop music style.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a nice ballad.  The lyrics are a little on the boring side, but that's not to say that the song itself is boring.  The music is very well done, and the song is a good example of the kind of music that I like when I listen to gospel (i.e. very smooth, very high quality).  I also like this song because it doesn't try to be a typical gospel song, but rather, it has a unique style that has a lot of soul.  I also like this song because of the beautiful vocals and the strong harmonies.  And, of course, I like this song because it's very different from any other song I've heard.  I think this is the type of song that would be best suited for an acoustic setting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a song that I'm going to listen to a lot.  It has a very high quality sound and the lyrics are very deep.  However, I can't say anything spectacular about this song.  I have a hard time putting my thoughts on paper when I don't have an opinion on the music.  However, if I were to write down my thoughts on this song, I would probably say that this is a nice song, but not anything special.  The only reason why I gave it a 5 star is because it's not very repetitive, and it contains a nice arrangement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really don't know what to say here.  It's a very simple song, and, therefore, it doesn't stand out as much as it should.  The song is very basic, and the instrumentation is very basic.  I would have liked to find a song that had a little more soul, but, alas, this is a little boring.  It might be interesting to listen to at church, but not for an average listener.  I give this a 1 star because it is not very interesting.

Amazon review: This is definitely one of the best songs that I've ever heard.  The music is very, very well done.  The lyrics are very deep, and the instrumentation is very well done.

Amazon review: This is just a very ordinary, very boring song.  The song itself is not that bad, but, unfortunately, it doesn't do much to distract the listener, and, therefore, it is boring.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: This probably is NOT the recording of this much praised song that you want - go to the album "I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight" and try the song there first.  I think I mis-bought this version first and could not understand why it was so often mentioned as among Richard and Linda's best.  Just saying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I do not know what the "tune" is called, but it is an original composition by the Dutch pop-composer Otto Bekker, who did some other nice things with words, such as "Sitar" and "Ensemble" and the like. His latest recording is "The Tides of Love", by which I mean the tunes. I like his version of "Aquarium" from "Sitar & Electronics", but somehow I can't get into it, even though it's called "Aquarium" and it's the fourth track on the CD. It's just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a fantastic recording, very different from Bekker's "Sitar & Electronics" work, but also very much in his own style of music. It's a great tune, not as smooth as "Strawberry Fields Forever", but still pretty smooth. I particularly like the way the tune is put together.

Amazon review: The Skillet Band was once one of the world's finest punk rock bands. Their best-known songs, like "The Great Destroyer", and "I Want to Be Your Dog", are among the most-requested songs on the internet. So it's no surprise that the band has released a new album. But the story that the band's new disc tells is not one that fans of Skillet will find all that reassuring.

Amazon review: The band's new album, Sky Records Vol. 1: The Last of Skillet, is the sound of a band with a new lease on life. While the band's music has always been aggressive and full of anger, the new album reflects a band attempting to break free of the past.

Amazon reviewer: I'm a huge fan of Skillet and their music. The only thing I don't love about the new Skillet album is the fact that Skillet's name is on the cover of the album. I know it's a cool name, but I just don't like it.  Rating: 4

Amazon review: Sky Records Vol. 1: The Last of Skillet is the band's second album, and while it has a lot of the same elements the band is known for, there's a lot more of the band's softer side that is here. The band's new album is the right time for the band to re-write their sound, and Sky Records Vol. 1 is the right record.  Rating: 4

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: I was so excited when I heard that David Lee Roth was playing at my local theater (the Hollywood Palace) for a concert. I checked out a review on the local news website (WFMU) and found that he was scheduled to play a show there. I decided to buy the ticket as I felt it was worth the $14.00 I spent on tickets. My expectations were not met. I was there for about an hour and walked out disappointed. I really thought I was going to see David Lee Roth but the show was a disaster. The set list included his greatest hits and some of his newer material was played. The band was awful and the show was poorly reviewed.

Amazon review: Phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th Century Records from the great pianist Ahmad Jamal with the other two members of his trio, Jamil Nasser on bass and Frank Gant on drums, along with Azzedin Weston in a very prominent role on congas, and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by Richard Evans. All six selections on the album were written by Ahmad and he produced it as well. "Jamal Plays Jamal" is a CLASSIC that has yet to be officially released on cd.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone can deny the great quality of this CD. It is a collection of different styles of music that was produced by the same artist, Ahmad Jamal. I must admit that I fell in love with some of the tracks I was listening to, but at the same time, I didn't really like all of them. I don't think the average listener will like this CD; it is just not a "must have" album for me and many others.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "Jamal Plays Jamal" is simply a great album. I love the fact that this album is a complete collection of all the works of Ahmad Jamal. There has never been a lack of a good album from Jamal. He has always been a great musician, a composer and one of the most important jazz musicians to have ever lived. Many of his compositions are classics that are great even today. Jamal Plays Jamal is simply one of the best albums that I have ever heard. I will always remember Jamal as an original and a talented musician.

Amazon review: Here is a great album from one of the great pianists of the modern age. Ahmad Jamal is in his late fifties, but he has been around the concert stage for almost forty years.

I am not sure whether this album will be released on cd, but to me it is a very good album.

Amazon review: The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song- it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.

It worked very well for a while but when it was time for me to leave work I realized that I had forgotten to set a song as the ringtone.  What a surprise.  I have spent many hours trying to put the song on my ringtone with no luck.  The only way to fix it was to restart the iPod and change the ringtone.  That was not the solution.  After trying to find the song with no luck I found a site that let me download the song to my hard drive.  I used this software to transfer the song onto my hard drive.  When I restarted the iPod it works great.  I have no regrets with the purchase since it worked so well and I could get rid of the music.

While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").  Dan manages to save some of the album with "Off The Map" and "Fine," but once again, they lyrics are sub par.
