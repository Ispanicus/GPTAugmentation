Amazon review: As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.

Amazon review: This album is by far, the best album Volbeat has done. I've listened to all of the albums in the past and this is by far, the best album I have ever heard. The vocals are the best in Volbeat's career and the guitar playing is phenomenal, and the bass playing is as good as any band in metal's history. It's absolutely amazing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wow. This album is great. The album is very well produced, sounding great, and there is a great selection of songs to choose from. The bass and drum playing is very good, but the vocals are very poor. I'm not sure why. Maybe because they're sung by a voice actor? It just kind of annoyed me with the vocals. They are bad. But, it's still a great album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The vocals on this album are not good. On the very first song with the vocals in it, the vocals are very bad. After listening to this for a while, the vocals just aren't very good.

I bought this album on a whim as I hadn't heard any new Volbeat albums yet. I had recently gotten into metal, and I was looking for a new metal album to listen to. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this album was. First off, the songs are very good. They are all original songs. The vocals are very good. The guitar playing is very good. The drums are very good. I don't understand why these songs were not played on the original Volbeat album. I feel that this album should have been on the original album. The songs are very well written and have great instrumentals. The production is very good. I think that this is a very good album. The only reason I gave this album a lower rating is because of the vocals. I think the vocals are very good, but they're nothing special. They're not as great as the vocals on the first Volbeat album, but they're still very good. If you like original music, listen to this album. If you like metal, listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my first volbeat album, and I think it is as good as the first album, but it is more so a collection of songs. Like the first album, all the songs are good, and it is fun to listen to, but I think the songs are a little bit repetitive.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: I've been a big fan of this band since I first heard their song in college. I was so impressed with them when their song "My City" was released. I've been a fan of theirs for over five years now, and have been listening to this album almost non-stop. What I like about them is how they have such great songs that can be sung. I'm always looking for something new to listen to. I'm also a huge fan of their live performances. I remember watching them perform the song "The Weight" live one year for the first time, and I was amazed at how they could so effortlessly blend into the band members. I love the fact that they are a band that doesn't limit themselves to one style of music. I also love the fact that they have been touring for so long with such a large following. I am also a huge fan of the song "We Are the World", which is one of my favorites. I'm a huge fan of any band that is a part of the All That Remains Tour. I listen to them all the time and have loved their songs since they first came out. I love their song "Dancing Through The Wires" because it is so beautiful. I really hope they get together again one day.

I don't like the songs. I don't like the music very much. I like the video, the music is great and the song's are good. I don't like the song "Heaven" because it is just a song about how people need to be happy and never complain. The song of the same name is one of my favorites. I think the album is ok but I don't really like any of the songs. I do like the video of the song "I Won't Dance" because it is cute and funny. I don't like the song "A Night In The Life" because the song isn't very long and is very slow. I don't like the song "Dancing Through The Wires" because it is just a song about dancing and dancing through the wires. The song "We Are the World" is a great song. I don't like the song "Ain't You" because it is just a song that says "I am better than you" and I don't think that it is a very good song. I don't like the song "Here Comes the Rain Again" because it is just a song about rain. I don't like the song "Dancing Through the Wires" because it is just a song about dancing through the wires. I don't like all the songs on the album and I don't like the song "We Are the World" because it is just a song about people being happy and never complaining.

Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.  The shift in focus from shredding to melody, long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing.  While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

The band is not a big name but they do a great job.  They have been my favorite band since I first heard them.  I have been a fan of theirs since I was a kid.  Their music has always brought me back to a time when I heard them.  I recently bought the two CDs from the last album that I have.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd with a few other purchases from Amazon.  I am not a fan of Dream Theater and I do not like the whole group.  I believe that the members of the band are mediocre.  They have a few good songs and a few weak ones.  I have only been to two shows with Dream Theater and I did not enjoy either.  The sound was terrible and the band was boring.  I did not like the band when I was there.  I believe that the band is mediocre and cannot be compared to any other band.  I am not a fan of the band.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed Dream Theater since their first show.  I was a die hard fan of the band since I was a pre teen.  I am a longtime member of the fan club and I have been to every show since the first show.  I have been a fan since I was a kid and I have been to every show since then.  If I could, I would have taken every Dream Theater show that I could get to see but I was not able to.  I did not like it at first but I eventually did.  I am now a fan of the band and I believe that they are a great band.  I am a big fan of the whole band because I like their music and I like the band.  I would not change anything about the band because they are a great band.  I like the songs of the band and I like the whole band because I believe in the band.  If I could, I would take every Dream Theater show I could.  I would prefer that they play every show and play them the way the band wants to play them and not the way the promoter wants them to be played.  I have been a fan since I was a kid and I like the band no matter what.  I would not change it for the world.  I have been to four shows and I have really enjoyed every single one.  I have seen them at the O2 in London and they were pretty good.  The audience was great.  I have seen them in Germany at their home town at the Veltinsparkaren.  The audience was great but the band was average.  I have never seen a Dream Theater show and I was very disappointed in the show.  I do not believe that the Dream Theater is a great band and I am not a fan of the band at all.  The band is great but I just do not like the band.  I do not like the whole band.  I do not like the music at all.

I saw them play in London at the O2 and the audience was terrible.  I saw them in Germany at their home town and the audience was terrible.  I saw them in Chicago at the Riviera Theater, where I got to see the band just before they went on tour.  It was not a good concert.  They were not very good there either.  I saw them in Las Vegas and I did not like the audience.  I did not like the show.  I liked the first three songs and then I stopped liking the show.  I do not like Dream Theater.

Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: This review is for the vinyl LP version.  Definitely not disappointed with this pressing, first off it is heavy,it feels even heavier than 180 grams. The mastering also seems pretty good, drums are tight and highs are bright, the saxophone especially shines. The stereophonics are just as good and the sound stage feels quite broad even with my closed back headphones. My favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one LP, they weren't.

Amazon review: For me, all but one song made for a very good CD.  Their voices are growing in depth and enrichment.  It's different music from their first CD  Some, like my father, who loved their first CD (because it was all of the Italian favorites = and he is Italian) didn't like this second album at all.  My husband and I liked it very much!

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very disappointed!  The wording on the description claims "various artists" leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original 80's artists.  IT IS NOT!  It is a mix sung by a "wedding singer/cruise line" type of band.  Is it even legal for a CD to be published with remakes of original artists song's without the permission of the original artists?  Hopefully this band paid for the rights to use these artists songs.  VERY MISLEADING AND DISAPPOINTING!

Amazon review: This is by far the best collection of Rare Earth there was. I say was cos' it looks like at the writing of this that it is now out of print.(sad). luckily I do own it. What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been. Every song on here is a winner, you've got the hits and the best of (almost) album tracks. But if Mowtown happens to read this please.

Amazon review: I have been a HUGE fan of Chicago's for the past 30 years and I must say I am very disappointed with this album.  Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.  These were the times in which the band had a diversity of styles and vocalists (Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, and Peter Cetera) however, as most fans know, the "Peter Cetera" sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventies and early eighties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Heard this on a movie and really dug the lyrics. Haven't really listened to it since I downloaded it. The intro was too long for me, and I don't like the vocals they are shaky like there is hardly any talent. Once I heard the whole song the lyrics aren't as impressive as when i heard it on the movie.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I didn't like this band at first. I thought the first few songs had no hooks and were repetitive. I went into this album expecting some good songs and was delighted to find that they had a couple. I felt that the songs on this album were well written and had some good hooks that made the songs more enjoyable. I like the vocal harmonies in most of the songs.

Amazon review: This is the album that made me fall in love with rock & roll. I have only seen one concert, a couple years ago, when I was in high school. I was in awe the first time I heard the band.

Amazon review: If you know anything about the bands around this time, this is the band you want to be listening to. Not only is it a solid album, it's probably the best thing out of that time. The songs on this album are timeless, with a great mixture of hard rock and a more mellow sound. The only downside to this album is that it's kind of hard to find on CD. However, it is worth the effort.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm sure its not the best song on this album, but I'm pretty sure it's the best one that I have ever heard. It seems to be at the point where I think everyone is going to want to have a copy. I've never heard a song like this before. It's like a song that's been stolen from a movie and then was left on a desert island. This could have been a hit, but it was not. Now I'm not saying this was their best song, but for that one song alone, it would have been enough for this album to be voted best album of the year.

Amazon review: This album is the work of a genius.  If you are looking for a new artist, this is it.  His flow is smooth and his raps are smooth as well.  He is a great lyricist.  He is a great producer.  Check him out.  He is a big fan of The Notorious B.I.G., Kanye West and DMX.  This is a classic album.  This album is perfect for all of your hip-hop needs.  The first album was the best.  The second one better.  The third one better still.  In my life I have used this album.  This album has taught me many things.  It has taught me that this is not the kind of music I would want for a rap album.  It is too much of a breakbeat type of hip-hop.  Even though his raps are smooth, there's no flow or style.  This album is better than his first album.  It is the better album in every way.  It is the best album ever.  This is the best album.

I like this album better than the first album.  I have used it to get in my workout. Also, I used this album to get in my workouts.  These are the best songs on the album.  The first album had two great songs, "Barefoot" and "Love In The Time Of The Dog."  The second album had three great songs, "I Love L.A.," "Livin' In The City" and "Hip-Hop."  The third album had two great songs, "Inner City" and "So Much B.I.G.."  I will be buying this album again.  I will be buying this album in the future.  It is worth the money.

I was very confused when I purchased this disc. I liked the lyrics of all the songs on the album, so I downloaded the songs onto my laptop, and then played them on my Sony Walkman. I liked them on my laptop, but when I listened to them on the Walkman, they sounded a little off. I stopped listening to them and decided to try them on my MP3 player. The MP3 player sounded much better. Then I tried them on my portable iPod, and they sounded great. I decided to buy this album and put it on my iPod, and now I have a CD that sounds great on all three formats. It's a great album!

Amazon review: As a fan of TSO. we were looking forward to this new 2 CD set with great anticipation. When it arrived, we immediately slid it into the CD player and were very surprised and disappointed. Although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept releases by TSO, this concept left us very cool. There is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise. We are pretty sophisticated listeners with extremely diverse musical tastes, but I must say this one was a bust.

Amazon review: Took his course up at the conference center. AMAZING! Changed my life. Increased my biblical understanding by 1000%! You simply can not go wrong with this. and Dan has been teaching this method to students of all types, cultures, countries, and languages for generations. it works, and you will understand it. All material, not a lot of added unnecessary b.s. (sorry). in other words the focus is the lessons, NOT Dan! If I could buy it for you, I would.

Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

It's one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat, sleeping with your cousin, sister, brother, dad, or whatever else is in this music.  Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.

"Dynamite" and "I Like Girls" are two of my favorite songs, and you can tell that Dan is a great guitar player and singer.  The rest are good, but not great, but I still give it a 9.5/10 due to the fact that I don't know all the songs.

Amazon review: Possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie.  This soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie.  Nothing fancy. Just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with Tim McIntire's great voice fits perfectly with the time period.  A perfect example of how less can be far more effective.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Micheal's for many years and was excited to see his new album coming out.  I was however, disappointed to see that it was nothing less than a collection of mediocre songs.  Not that I've disliked all of his previous work, but this is his worst yet.  What Micheal has done is made a collection of songs that are in no way connected to one another and that are just slapped together together.  A collection of songs that have no meaning, no emotion and no heart.  Micheal's last album was very much a return to form.  This one however, is a complete failure.  I wouldn't buy it again.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that all sound very similar to one another.  They're all about love and sex but they all sound boring, I have no idea what they mean, there's nothing exciting about any of them.  I think the songs do have a lot of energy, but they don't have an ounce of meaning.  I just can't get behind this album.  I don't get it.  I'm sorry, Micheal, but I don't get it.

I can't believe they are not trying to make any kind of meaning from any of the songs.  I would say the songs are just very, very boring.  I can't believe this album is just so bad.  If it was a movie then I hope the ending would reflect how bad the movie really is.  I just don't get it.  I really don't.

This album is a must have.  I love it.  This album always has a meaning to me.  It always makes me feel good to listen to.  When I'm depressed or sad or just feel down I just can't wait to turn on one of these songs and just let them pour out of my ears.  This album is great.
