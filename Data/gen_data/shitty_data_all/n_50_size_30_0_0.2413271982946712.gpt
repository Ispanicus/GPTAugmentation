Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

I bought this album as a gift at one of the stores. I listen to the music on it pretty regularly, and love it. I recommend this album, as its a great way to introduce yourself to the music of Schubert, Bach, Brahms, and of course, the famous classical music from the romantic period.

It sounded like someone had taken a CD of white noise and recorded one song (or maybe two) on it.

It has made a great difference in her life and I have received a lot of compliments about it, so I am very pleased.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD at length hoping that I would like it, but I would have to say I didn't.  I will say that this is a very good CD that I can enjoy.  There are five people on this cd who really know how to put a message through.  The message that the people on this cd are trying to send is that life is a struggle and you should get up and get to work.  The message that the people on this cd are trying to send to the listener is that you should try to reach out and help those in need so that the world can be a better place.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in a message of hope and love.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone who has an agenda to tell someone something that is not true.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson was a man who sang and played the blues.  He was a man who sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues!  Robert Johnson was a man who believed in the power of the blues and the fact that if you can sing the blues, you can play the blues.  His singing voice is smooth and his guitar work is amazing.  I don't know if it is true or not, but Robert Johnson did sell his soul to the devil himself, and the devil has a beautiful voice!  If you can sing the blues and play the blues, you can sell the blues.  The last time I saw Robert Johnson was when I went to see him in Chicago.  He was sitting at the end of the bar and I walked up to him and asked him if he wanted to see my friend.  He said, "We don't have a drummer, and we don't have a singer, but I do have my guitar.  I would love to see your friend!"  I was really surprised when he said that, because I expected him to say that he wanted to see my friend.  He was a good guy.  He had a nice smile and he was wearing a nice shirt.  He had a nice pair of jeans on and he was wearing some nice shoes.  He actually looked like a regular guy.

The problem with this album is that it is just a bunch of songs about being a woman.  I don't think I have ever heard of a woman named "Lilah" singing a song called "I'm a Woman."  I do not think the world needs another woman named "Lilah," it doesn't need another woman singing a song called "I'm a Woman."  The last track is about a man who is cheating on his wife and he says that life is a struggle and you need to get up and get to work.  The song goes on and on about how life is a struggle and you need to get up and get to work because if you don't, there is not going to be a tomorrow.  That is a message that is not going to make anyone

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This album is a best album

This album is a good album, but it's a little bit of a mixture of stuff. A lot of the material is pretty good, but then you have the filler material. The music is good and the lyrics are decent, even the songs that are filler.

It's not my favorite Eminem album, but it's not too bad. I still love it though. It's a good album

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I bought the album because I like the artist and felt it was a good idea.  This CD was a little more mixed for me, but I still like the performance.  I didn't think it was very good, but I did like it.  I think that album needs to be re-mastered.  I think some songs sound better with better production values.  For example, "You Don't Know" sounds better with a better sound.  I like the songs, but not enough to put 2 and 2 together.  I did like the album.  I don't know how many times I had to listen to it to get the full effect of the songs.  I just didn't want to hear the song.  I liked the sound of the album, but the songs just did not do it for me.  I'm sorry that I didn't like this album.  I really liked the 1st album, but this is just not the same.  I will try to listen to it more, but I just can't get into the songs.

Amazon review:  This is not a great album.  I was hoping to hear something really great and I didn't.  It is very "pop" in the truest sense of the word.  A typical pop singer song.

I've heard this song on more then one occasion. It's one of my favorites, but the vocal performance is really poor.

I also agree with the other comments that he should be dropped from the music business.

Here is my review of his latest album

He is a great singer and has a great voice, however, he is not a great composer. I know this is a popular opinion, but I've heard much better song composers then him. The song is great, but the vocals are really bad. The song is not bad, just listen to some of the other songs he has done, he is better then what he has done on this album.

The song is great, but the vocals are really bad. He has a great voice and the song is great, but the vocals are really bad. It does not matter if you like the song, because it's just not the kind of song you would listen to.

This song is great, but the vocals are really bad.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: This is the band I heard as a teenager.  And you can't imagine a band as powerful as this has ever been.  A band that could have been a powerhouse in the late 70's/early 80's had it been allowed to stay together for the full length of its career.  Yet, they played their last show and disbanded.  Their music is as powerful as the rock music it stands in comparison to.  And their legacy is an example to all bands.  You can't imagine a band as powerful as this has ever been.  And you can't imagine a band as powerful as this has never been.
