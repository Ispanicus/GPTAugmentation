Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: JP is one of the few guitarists playing today who is not a carbon copy of Jim Hall and John Fahey(in my opinion).  This album is a great fusion of all styles JP has been playing for some time and his playing on "Ave Maria" is superb.  The soloing on "I'll Fly Away" is excellent too.  I only wish he could have a more balanced recording to compare with the multi-instrumental albums he has played in the past.  (I don't think he's ever made a recording that I don't like, and as far as I know he's never released an instrumental album).
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to JP recently, but this is a great album, especially "I'll Fly Away".  He also plays some great solos on the last couple of tracks of the album.  I am very disappointed that the song "Ave Maria" is only about half way thru.  I liked the song and the soloing on it, but it just seems to end on a whim, as if JP was done.  It does not seem to have any ending whatsoever, and the soloing seems to end with the last note.  I'm sure he would have liked the song, but I am not sure why it was so drastically cut.

Amazon review: I have listened to this twice, and I am still having trouble getting into the music.  There are times I can hear things that are good, like the soloing on "Mermaids in Love", but I am not sure about the music.  There is nothing that stands out to me as a significant difference between this music and the music I listen to in my personal listening experience.  It is good music; there are some great solos on this CD, but I am not hearing any music that changes my experience of the music.  There are some great vocals on the CD, but it is not a "rock" album.  I am not sure what JP is trying to accomplish with this CD - he is trying to be a musician, but it is not coming across to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I recently purchased this in order to hear JP play.  I am disappointed.  The guitar playing is fine, but the song writing is not appealing to me.

I will no longer support JP.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is the first album I have heard from the Waits I listened to as a kid.  I had heard him on the radio, but I was a kid, and I didn't listen to much radio.  I bought this album because I had just had my second car, so I needed something to listen to.  I listened to this album while I was driving my new car, and I got stuck in a bit of a rain.  So I would listen to this album, put my car in drive and then go back to the radio.  Then I would listen to it again.  It was a good way to pass the time.  I'm not sure it's a good album, but it's not a bad one, either.  I like his humor, and it's got some good songs.  I wasn't all that impressed with "New Orleans" or "Don't Come Around Here No More".  I liked "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" a little better, but I liked "Tequila Sunrise" better.

The lyrics are funny, and the humor of the songs is original.  There is a few songs I didn't get.  "What's For Dinner" is good, but "Don't Come Around Here No More" is just not funny at all.  I like the songs that were the best on this album, and there are a few that are pretty funny.  I liked "I Walked With a Zombie" the best, and I liked "Riot on the Highway" a little better.  I didn't like the last song, "The Devil Went Down to Georgia".  The last song is just not funny at all, and the funny parts of the lyrics are just not funny.

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

http://www.amazon.com/Reggae-Connection-Keith-Richards/dp/B000DZYWZU

A few friends and I decided to write an email to Keith's record company, Atlantic Records.  It was a long and awkward discussion that never concluded.  We were a minority of one.   A few of my friends and I wrote a letter and sent it to several record companies asking to be considered for the next Atlantic Records label.  The reason for our request was simple: We felt that Atlantic Records was taking its music too seriously.  It was in no way a personal attack on Keith, it was an honest appraisal of what Keith had done to date and what he planned for the future.  We did not want to be a part of a label that would only put out a few mediocre artists.  We did want to be a part of a label that would put out great artists.  We did not want to be a part of a label that did not understand the importance of the music it was putting out.  We wanted Atlantic Records to look at the talent of its artists and not only the popularity of the artist.   We wanted the label to be aware of the talent that existed within the group of artists it was putting out.   We wanted a label that was aware that there were many wonderful artists in the world, and we wanted them to be exposed to them.   We wanted a label that wanted to be part of the world, and we wanted the world to be a part of them.  The world has to understand that the world is a part of them.

Some of the other labels we discussed with also had similar requests, but none of them were willing to accept them.  We sent a few letters to artists who were big in their own right (Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Paul Simon, etc.) and we received the same response: "We're already doing the same things with other artists".  Most of the time the response would be "I don't have the time to listen to your albums, you'll have to get someone else to do it for me."   We did not expect an honest answer, we expected a one-sided answer.   We were disappointed that we were not part of the world's largest independent label.  We knew that we wanted to be considered for such an opportunity, but we wanted the world to know that we were more interested in the music that was already on the label then the music that was yet to come.  We still wanted the world to know that we wanted to be considered for the label, but we had to know that we could be considered.   We were tired of the world not understanding that the world was a part of them.  We were tired of the world believing that only the big

Kelly song, but it is not a classic R. Kelly song.  The song has a lot of backing vocals, but it is not very well-written.  I am not even sure what genre this song is in.  I listened to many RK songs and all of them have a similar sound to this song.  However, I have never heard a song by this group in which the vocals sound like this song does.  I do not think the song is any good, but I like the backing vocals a lot.  I also like the guitar playing in this song.  It is very loud and sounds like a drum machine, but the guitar playing is different.  This song is very simple.  The song's chorus is an "A" chord, so the whole song has a very simple chord structure.  I think it is a good song for the radio, but its not a good song for the radio.  This song is not a good song for the radio.  This song is not good for the radio.  All of the lyrics in this song are about "love". I am not sure if he is talking about love, sex, or anything else.  I do not think this song has any redeeming value.  I don't want to listen to this song.  The song is not good for the radio and is not good for the club.  This song is not good for the radio.

Amazon review: I love the lyrics, but the way she sings them is all wrong. Kind of off key. She sings a little high, and a little low. She also sings over the line a lot. This album is good for what it is, but I don't think it will stand out much in the CD world.

Amazon review: I love her voice. "This is the one to own, the one you'll put on when you need a lift, the one you'll turn to when you're down and out, the one you'll call when you're in trouble and can't seem to get yourself together."  The CD is great, however, she sings a little too high, and a little too low. She sings a little high, and a little low. She sings a little high, and a little low.

I listen to it in a car, on my ipod, and over the radio. The lyrics are great, and so is the music. It reminded me of her early days, when you didn't need to be a singer to be in show business. She is still in great shape.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: This is a great collection of some of the best recordings of the great French pianist and clarinetist.  I have bought this book and have enjoyed every page.  I love the way you can hear the music in your head as you listen to each disc.  The music is beautiful, and the playing is always amazing, never mind the fact that the records are over 20 years old.  I am always surprised that the music in this book doesn't find a place in the music world.  It would be a shame if it didn't.  I am sure that the music played by many great pianists in the past years is not well known.  It's always refreshing when I listen to one of their recordings that they are putting out today.  I am a huge fan of Erich Leinsdorf and have long admired the music he played.  I was a member of the band that played on Erich's CD "Cantos" and I was one of the few people that did not know that he was a pianist.  The music that he plays is so beautiful and the sound is so great.  I hope that Erich's music will be heard sooner rather than later!  The album covers are beautiful and I hope that people will get to know a little bit more about Erich and his music.  I am glad that you were able to get the book in time for me to enjoy it.  It is very impressive.  I am happy that I was able to get the book before I had to buy everything from the store.  I have been a fan of his for many years.  He does wonderful things and I wish that his music would be heard by more people.  I hope that you will enjoy the book even more than I have.  I have a copy for every member of my family.  I have it in the car, in the house, in the bathroom, and everywhere.  I listen to it on my CD player in the car, and while in the shower.  I love that CD player and it is such a wonderful piece of technology.  When I first got my CD player, I realized that I was just a normal guy that had a CD player in my house.  It was a great feeling to me.  I have a CD player in my car, in the house, and in the bathroom.  I have a CD player in the bedroom, which is where I do most of my work, as well as in the living room.  I also have a CD player in the kitchen.  I don't remember when I got the CD player in the car, but I am sure I had it for quite some time.  It's a great piece of technology and I am happy to have it.  I have been listening to it everywhere I go these days, and it has come in handy.  I have been using it to listen to the CDs in my car.  It is so much easier to listen to a CD now as I can play it on the CD player in the car.  I love that CD player.  I have a CD player in my car, in the house and in the bathroom.  I also have a CD player in the bedroom, in the kitchen, and in the living room.  The CD player in the bathroom is where I shower, and when I am at work, I play CD's on the CD player in the house while I am working.  The CD player on my computer is in the bedroom and the kitchen.  I don't like being in the living room.  In the kitchen, I have a CD player in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, and the living room.  I don't like being in the bedroom.  I am sure there are others that feel like this too.  I am happy that I have a CD player in the bedroom.  I love to listen to music and I am glad that I have my CD player in the bedroom.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved this song, but did not have it on any device.  I loved playing it Christmas morning.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The reviews are pretty mixed up to this point, but this CD is a real winner.  The tracks all have a real, natural feeling that is missing from most modern pop-rock.  The lyrics are mostly straightforward and have the ring of honesty and emotion.  This is one track that can be recommended to just about anyone.

I don't know about you, but I think that's the most entertaining thing I've heard all year.  I was at one of the last shows, and I was actually sitting around in a circle with Jewel's friends, when Jewel came out and sang a few songs.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a mix of popular classics and obscure pieces from the Great American Songbook.  Of all the CDs I've purchased recently, this one is the best.  The songs are not only well chosen, but they're catchy.  The only flaw I see on this CD is the poor sound quality.  I have a CD player at home, and you can't hear the difference between this and the CD player.

Amazon review: I have to admit I was a big fan of the Dave Clark Five.  Although I wouldn't necessarily say my opinion of them was completely positive, I can remember a time when I was listening to their music at home and I was really enjoying it.  Their songs still hold up even though I've heard them so many times.  I can't imagine my life without them.  The CD's I've purchased from them have always been well done.  I have no complaints about this one.

Amazon review: These guys (Kurt Vile and the Violators) had a hit song called "American Girl" and I was fascinated by the idea of a woman who had to go to college.  I always thought the song was a little too sappy for me, but I thought I'd give them a try.  I purchased their debut album in a small store in the mall in the town where I lived.  The store owner told me to call him if I had any problems with the CD's.  I thought they were great, so I called the store.  He told me that he had already received the CDs and there were no problems.  I made sure to listen to them and decided that they were pretty great.  I think this is one of the top five albums I've ever purchased.  It has a lot of good songs and is very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The Dave Clark Five were the Beatles of the 60's.  I was a big fan of their work and would listen to most of their songs when I was in 8th and 9th grade.  I was lucky enough to get their first album "The Nylon Curtain" in the mail.  I really enjoyed the songs on this CD, and I would listen to it again.  Now, I am a big fan of the Dave Clark Five.  I have listened to the CD's of them over and over again.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes their music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would have to say I've never heard a more boring, clichéd, and uninteresting album.  The only thing that comes to mind is the one time the Beatles played at a small club in my hometown of Syracuse, New York.  I had seen them a few times, but I had to be there to see them because the club was only open on Monday nights.  When I got there, they were already at work on their second album.  The place was not nearly as crowded as it was the night before, so there was a feeling of being in a church.  I was in the back and did not see who was sitting in front of me.  I also did not see the band members as they arrived.  I got to the front of the stage and saw them playing.  There wasn't a single person in the audience.  When they finished their playing, I turned around and saw a line of people waiting to get into the club.  When I tried to get in, there were no vacancies.  I went back to my seat and left at the end of the night.  I was just so bored and didn't have anything to do.  I was just a kid at the time.  I'm now 40 years old and have never bought anything from this band.  I've been an avid fan of music for as long as I can remember.  I bought their first album at the age of 14 and have been a fan of them ever since.  It's a shame that these guys are not more famous or appreciated.  I have a CD that I've purchased that is by them, and I didn't even know it was from them.  I just bought it because it was on sale.  I would really like to have a copy of their first album, but I haven't been able to find it.  I don't even know how to get that information out to a music store.  I just wish they were more popular and knew that they had a big fan base.  I have seen them live a few times, but I've never seen them play a record in it's entirety.  I would think they would have a new CD out every year, or at least every two years.
