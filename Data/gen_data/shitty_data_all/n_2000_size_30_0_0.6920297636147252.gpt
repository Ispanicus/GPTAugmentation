Amazon review: I don't care what religion she is; the music is good, and I hope her publicity stunt really pays off. All those rich celebrities who are in the closet as conservatives didn't have the guts to do what she did yesterday! She is a strong, independent, fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrities to just come out already!

Amazon review: This is by far the best collection of Rare Earth there was. I say was cos' it looks like at the writing of this that it is now out of print.(sad). luckily I do own it. What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been. Every song on here is a winner, you've got the hits and the best of (almost) album tracks. But if Mowtown happens to read this please.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my fave and number 1 Xtina song. I love her songwriting, I love her voice, I love her stage presence. I love her energy. This song is my favorite single that Xtina has released. I love Xtina's voice, I love her lyrics, I love her stage presence. This song is a throwback to her early years when she had a soulful voice. It makes me feel like I'm in the studio recording her. I love her music more than anything and I love her personality.

Amazon review: This song made me want to buy a copy of "Love Me Right" in a heartbeat. It's one of the best songs that Lecrae has ever done. I'm not sure why people don't like this.

I think if the producers had made the song a little bit slicker, it would have been a great single.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: It's unfortunate that there isn't a negative rating scale. The disc took five weeks to arrive. Both the sound quality and the renditions of the songs were abysmal, even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging. Recycled the day it arrived.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first two minutes are the only thing worth watching. The other twenty minutes are just a series of repetitive, poorly-tuned, overly-expressive songs that have nothing to do with the rest of the album.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I thought it would be a great mix of shoegaze and indie. I was not disappointed. The band is great, the instruments sound great, and the songwriting is flawless and unique. The lyrics are also very well-written. This is a collection of excellent songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I can't hear the lyrics; the song is so far away that I can't tell what the lyrics are. I listened to this album for the first time a week or so ago, and it blew me away. I couldn't figure out what the song did in the first listen. I have been looking for this album for over six months and I still can't figure out what the title means. I tried searching for the title online, and it turns up in the songs of several other artists. I can't find the track online. I don't understand why it's not listed with the other songs, but I could do with an explanation.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this record is great. It's great to have a new release in the indie/emo genre. But I think this is just a big mix of shoegaze, noise/experimental, and indie. The songs are good, but the lyrics are just silly. It's a good record, but I think it could have been a lot better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album for the shoegaze/indie fan in most people. The songs are not too out there and each one has a unique style. The most I could find of a negative review is just that it's one of the first shoegaze records I came across and wasn't very good. I like the album, but I think the quality is a little bit lacking.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: While the art is beautiful, I would like to comment about the music itself. I was very disappointed with this album. It's really slow, sometimes almost at a crawl. The vocals are mediocre, the songwriting is terrible, and the instrumentation is really bland. The songs are not bad, but everything else is just not to my taste. I would have given the album 4 stars if I had the time to listen to it carefully, but I wasn't able to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you're looking for a shoegaze album this is a good one. While it's slow at times and not very strong lyrically, the music is good. It's nothing special, but I think you can get the message of the lyrics by listening to the songs.

###
Amazon review: I'm not sure I have ever heard of Howard Shore. And I'm not sure I'm interested in his music. I don't think this is his best work, but it's certainly not his worst.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've heard this music before, but never had the opportunity to listen to it, until now. It's a pretty good effort, and the vocals are decent. I don't think it's quite as good as it sounds, but I think it's still a decent effort.

Amazon review: I liked this record. I bought it because it had the words "I like it when you kiss me" on the cover art. It's a pretty good record. I got a good kick out of "All in the Mind," which I thought was very catchy and pretty, and the lyrics were easy to understand.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't know what to expect with this album. I would have been really disappointed if this wasn't good. It is kind of a shoegaze album, but it could have been much better.

I was hoping that this album could be a good shoegaze album, but it just isn't.

My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words). The "listen" ability on Amazon only gives a bit of the refrain, but I purchased it anyway with great hopes. OK, it was only 99 cents, so no harm done. But, it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: There are a lot of four or five star reviews saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation, this album is just as good or better. WHAT?!  If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.  If a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldn't be bluegrass.  When U2 decided to go electronica on their Pop album it sucked.  That's what this is.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first half of the album is a collection of originals all with very strong, memorable hooks, while the second half is a collection of cover songs. This album is very enjoyable and it shows the talent of a young duo that has a lot of potential. The only reason I gave this album a four star rating is because the cover of "Love is Just a Game" is probably the worst cover I have ever heard. I feel that it is a bit of a cop-out to cover a song like this. The original version is much more original than this version.

After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

Amazon review: This is not the "Theme from Enterprise". This is the same song, "Where My Heart Will Take Me", that was used as the theme for Enterprise but this version from the "Encore" CD is not the same arrangement and the differences are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the "Enterprise" TV series.

I'm sorry to say that I did not enjoy it very much. I wish that the band would listen to what I said, but they still have not listened to what I said. They say that I am a bad critic, but I think I am more than just that. I don't know how they could listen to what I said and at the same time ignore my advice. They have not listened to what I have said. I do not want to have to stop buying their albums because of what I said.

Review by: Dottie O

I really enjoyed this album. The music is great and the vocalist is very good. I really liked each and every song on this album. The only problem I had was with the CD player. It was very loud and made the other songs seem very small. It was very hard for me to listen to this CD. It was the worst CD I have ever had.

I'm a big fan of The B-52's and this is one of my favorite albums. This is probably my favorite album of the last 20 years. I don't know what it is, but the vocals are different from

Amazon review: Not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash. It's a shame what passes for hip-hop these days. People seem to be more in love with Weezy's production than his lyrics, which is apparent to anyone that actually cares about the lyrics at all, because Lil Wayne is whack.  I'm not a "hater", I don't gain anything by dissing Lil Wayne at all. He's just another average, untalented, main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record companies are trying to pass off as Hip-Hop.

Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.

Amazon review: This is a song by an American singer-songwriter Bill Monroe. "I'm Going To Be A Dog" is the working title of Monroe's only record. Monroe was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1914. He was raised in Evanston, Illinois, before moving to California in his teens. Monroe is best known for his work in musical theater, as a movie actor, and as a songwriter. His first three records appeared on the Capitol label, while "I'm Going To Be A Dog" was on the Decca label.

I've listened to this many, many times, but I never thought of it as being this good. It's a great song, and it has the best chorus I have ever heard. The guitar, bass, and drums are what really make this song, I've never heard anything like it.

Sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range. The bass is nonexistent, and was quieter than most of my other records. I've listened to it about 3 times now, just to see if it needed to break in a bit. Nope! Just horrible.

Amazon review: I gave this one a 3 of 5 because I'm not a huge fan of the style of music this type of album is, but it was pretty good. Not as good as the original record, I might have given this a 2 if the original hadn't been a cover of the original version. This version is the original, so the music is not the same as the original version.

Amazon review: This is the remastered version of the album originally released in 2005. It plays very well, with a better bass and a more consistent dynamic range. The guitar sounds are good, the vocals are good, and the songs are well performed. It's a very good remaster.

Amazon review: This is one of the best records I have ever bought. It's a reissue. When you buy a reissue you are buying the original version, and this is a very good version.

Amazon review: I don't know what it is with me but I have a weakness for Jazz. It's not just a genre of music, it's a way of life for me. It's what I like to do. I love the way it gets me in the mood for a night out. I like the way it gets me in the mood for a good day of work. I like the way it gets me in the mood for a long evening conversation with my friends. And I like the way it gets me in the mood to make love to my husband. My husband, in his defense, is not always very good with music. He likes jazz and he likes classical. And I like classical. I like classical music, not jazz. And I like jazz, not classical. I like jazz because it is a "real" music. And I like classical because it is so "boring". I like the feeling that I get when I listen to classical. It's a great feeling. I like the feeling that I get when I listen to jazz. I like the feeling that I get when I listen to classical. I like the feeling that I get when I listen to jazz. It really feels like something else. It's a great feeling. I like the way it gets me in the mood for the day. And I like the way it gets me in the mood for a night out.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: A great slow song.  I loved this slow song when I was a teen in high school.  I think it came out immediately after "If I Ever."  I thought the tall one was sooooooo fiiiiiiine!  Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.  Their tenor and baritone voices are great in this song.  It's a classic.  They remind me of the guys from "The Platters," I think that's my grandparents generation.

Amazon review: An absolutely fantastic piece of art.  The notes are so beautifully sung.  It was the first song I ever heard that was written as a concerto.  I was in awe of my parents when they started listening to this amazing piece.  I still believe it is the best song ever written.  I'm always moved when I hear this piece of music.  It is a testament to the power of music.

Amazon review: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this song.  I love the lyrics and the music.  In fact, my parents have a great harmony singing version of this song on their albums.  They are great friends.

Amazon review: This song is just so beautiful.  When I first heard this song I was shocked by the beauty of the melody and the arrangements.  I was amazed at how well they were done.  The only downside is the sound quality is a little weak.  I was able to download the mp3 version from the SoundCloud below.  You can hear how it sounds on the mp3 version.  I highly recommend the mp3 version.  You can also listen to this song on YouTube with the same arrangement.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I think this is one of the best rock songs ever written.  There is no doubt about it.  The only problem is that it does not have a chorus.  It is a slow song that is easy to get into.  You can get it on your own or you can buy it.  I bought the album on iTunes and played it on my car stereo.  It was a great way to listen to this song.  You can listen to the song on YouTube.

Amazon review: It is worth taking the time to listen to this album. The sound quality is very good. The songs are well written and well performed.

The only two songs that really work are the title song and Never Again.

Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.

Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.

When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

Amazon review: An interesting mix of reggae and dub reggae.  My favorite track on the album was "Dance Like a Witch" but "Bangladesh" is pretty bad and "Happy New Year" was just plain bad.  There are great tracks on this album, but it could go so much better.

Amazon review: This is not a bad dub album, but I don't think it's a good dub album.  The music is hard to hear.  I feel like I was listening to dub music for the first time and suddenly realized how terrible it was.  It's not a bad dub album, but it's not a great dub album either.

Amazon review: This isn't a bad reggae album, but I don't think it's a great reggae album.  It took me a long time to find the beginning of this album, but my favorite tracks are the ones that I can hear, "You" and "Bangladesh."  I think the other tracks are good, but they don't have the same effect as the beginning of the songs.  "Fingerprints" and "Mama" are the only good songs on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure what to think about this album.  I like the music, but I can't tell if I like the album or not.  I did like the two songs "You" and "Bangladesh," but then I started to wonder why they were called "You" and "Bangladesh."  I guess it's a cute name, because they're not so bad, but it's hard to believe the songs aren't any good.  The other songs are good, but they're not great.  Like I said before, I like the music and the vocals, but the album just doesn't hold my attention.  I didn't like the songs, but I liked the album.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: This is a great cd for the summer. At first, at first, I thought it was a "mock" of the album "Hallelujah" by Bob Dylan, but then I realized that Mac miller is a great writer. His music is so personal and I really like the fact that he is taking all those good ideas from other genres and blending them into his own. The vocals are really nice, the beats are awesome and the lyrics are really poetic. I highly recommend this cd for anyone who enjoys a variety of genres and who also likes their music to have a little more soul and emotion.

Amazon review: I found this album at a thrift store in the early 90's and it is one of the best cd's I ever heard. I love the beat, the lyrics, the beats and the lyrics are great as well.

Amazon review: Maroon 5 has joined the likes of all the other modern day groups. What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike.

Amazon review: I bought this song, hoping that this version also included the verse as well as the refrain. Sadly, it's only the refrain. My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words).
