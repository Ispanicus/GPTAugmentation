Amazon review: I fell in love with Ann Wilson the first time I heard Dreamboat Annie.  36 years later, Ann Wilson sounds even better.  Wether you are a Heart fan, or have never heard the group before, this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll.

Amazon review: Excellent work of art.  She's on target with every song.  Seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative, bad girl image.  Some people want to boycott her album until she gets help but there's no question, this is a top quality production.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Black Crowes, but I have a hard time taking them seriously.  They're too full of themselves and their music is so derivative of other great bands.  This album is not a bad one, but it's a very boring one.  All the songs are very similar sounding but no matter how many times I listen to this album, I can't get my mind around why I like the songs on this one.  And I'm sure there are exceptions but this is the general consensus.

Amazon review: This album is a mess.  Every song is cliche.  The production is uneven and the songs never sound like they belong together.

Amazon review: These songs are great.  They remind me of the White Stripes.  The only problem is, they're pretty boring.  There's nothing particularly different about these songs, and no one really has a good idea what they'd sound like if I sang them in a different key.

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

The quality of the recording is poor and the sound is very loud.  I know Diana is a very talented singer and I appreciate her work.  Unfortunately, a lot of people do not have a good ear and the vocals do not come across very well.  This is not a very good CD and I will not purchase it again.

Amazon review: Diana Ross is a fantastic singer who has become in the last 10 years (just in the last 5 years) one of the most iconic voices of all time.  She's a true artist at work.  I've never been disappointed with her musical performances.  However, this is a poorly produced CD.  I can't believe this is the version of this song that is in the movie.  It is a shame that Diana Ross is not a better musician.  I am disappointed.

Amazon review: Having worn out my vinyl copy of Animalisms, the Animals third album, the first beeing "The Animals" and the second "Animals Tracks, I bought the cd on the Repertoire label and it easily qualifies as the worst remastering job I've heard so far.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.

Amazon review: Just when you think you've heard it all, you come across another masterpiece, or maybe just something you didn't know you were missing. With this album, Phil Spector was on a roll. His albums had been slow in the beginning, but now they were going up in a hurry. The band sounded great and played with a little edge. The album is in three parts, and the first half is a fairly typical rock 'n roll album, while the second half has some rockin' grooves with a little more of a beat. With this album, Spector was finally getting to the point where he could really do something innovative. With this album, he was on his way to becoming one of the most important musical artists of all time.

Description:
"I've been a fan of Butch since the first time I heard "The Ringer", and I have always been impressed by the album's quality and the songwriting. I've been a huge fan of his for as long as I can remember, and I've been anxiously waiting for a new album to come out for a long time. This album is the one I've been waiting for. With a good singer and good songwriting, this album will please fans of the band as well as newcomers to the band. I've always been an admirer of Butch's work, and his ability to write a good song has always been one of my favorite things about him. This album is an excellent album that I've always been anticipating for a long time. He has done it again. I love this album, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Butch fan, and anyone who wants to listen to a good singer in a good band. The title song is my favorite, and the song title sums up what this album is all about. I will post on the Butch forum when the album is released, so I can listen to the whole thing and give my opinion. Until then, enjoy this album. Butch is back." - Sane

Amazon review: I'm not sure what those who gave this 4 or 5 stars are thinking. This is awful! I realize there will always be sycophants of certain bands who are so enamored with them they will always rate 5 stars when it's painfully obvious 5 stars are NOT in order. This is certainly one of those times. This CD is horrific, and that's being charitable. I LOVE old Van Halen - they are among my all-time faves. But this? Who, in their right minds, can give this crap 3 stars, much less 4 or 5?

I like the songs on this one more than the last one. The only problem that I have with this album is the vocals on "Livin' on a Prayer". This album doesn't have that amazing vibe that you get from the last album. It's like it was made for someone who doesn't understand how to properly play it.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Diana Krall was born in St. Louis on October 7, 1941. She has said that she "grew up listening to a lot of music." She is the lead singer for the multi-platinum-selling pop group Diana Krall. She is also the lead singer for the group, the band that has released three albums.

Personal life

Diana Krall was born in St. Louis, Missouri and moved to Los Angeles, California with her parents, Mildred and Paul Krall, when she was three years old. Her father Paul Krall was a jazz drummer, and her mother Mildred was a pianist. She spent her childhood around music. Her father had a jazz club called the Jazz Place, which was located on the corner of 3rd and Spring Streets in Los Angeles. The Jazz Place was a "live" jazz club that played a variety of music.

Diana Krall began studying classical music at the age of nine, but moved to Los Angeles at age eighteen to begin rock and roll. She had been a fan of the Fats Waller Orchestra, and was studying the guitar at age nine. During her youth, Diana Krall studied classical music at a private school, and moved to Los Angeles to continue her studies at the University of Southern California.

In the late 1970s, Krall decided to move to New York City. During this time, she and her band toured the world, and became popular. She moved to New York City at the age of twenty-one, where she attended New York University to study classical music. Her first album was called Time Traveler, but was sold as Time Traveler, a New York album.

In the 1980s, Krall moved to London and recorded her first album. Her second album, The Real Diana Krall, was released in 1988. In the 1990s, Krall moved to Los Angeles. She did not, however, record a new album until 1993. Her first album in Los Angeles was called Diana Krall. Her third album under the title of Diana Krall released in 1995, was titled Diana Krall. Her fourth album, Viva La Vida, was released in 2000. In the 2000s, she has been concentrating on her music and her role as an actor. She has starred in the movie, The Bodyguard.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not normally a fan of remixes, and in this case there is no exception. If you have not bought the original OneRepublic album (Dreaming Out Loud) that has this song on it, you are missing out. I understand Timbaland helped OneRepublic get started, but there is no reason for taking credit for someone else's song.  I feel that Timbaland's contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out. I much prefer the original mix to this version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The instrumentation is amazing, the vocals are very good but when I first heard the lyrics I just thought WTF. This has got to be a joke. Why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song. I was extremely let down. It still gives me hope for the sound of this upcoming album. If the lyrics were any better this would be one the most badass songs ever.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is just plain weird. I was listening to the radio one time and "Addiction" came on and I just couldn't get out of my head that it was a song about addiction and I had to listen to it. I never paid attention to the lyrics because I thought it was just a rock song. I was wrong. This song was just plain weird. The song is about two people and how their lives have changed over the years. The main characters are a man and a woman. The man is in a loveless marriage, never really loved or appreciated by the woman. In the song the woman tells the man that she is going to leave. As the song progresses, the songs progresses through many different moods. The first verse is about the feeling of the man being in the loveless marriage, he doesn't know what he is doing, he doesn't know what he wants from life. The second verse is more of the woman. This time she is in love with the wrong man. As the song progresses the emotions are more open between the two characters. I would like to see the song go on and on more, but this song is so weird. The lyrics are strange and the music is good. I think I would like to buy the original CD if I had the chance. But I would like to see this song go on and on.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song was pretty good. I bought this CD when I was a teenager and when I first heard the song I thought it was a joke. It was a "Honey, I'm the D.N.A." song. One of my friends had a cousin that I was very close to. I was watching out for her and all I could think about was her. I felt like the song was about me and her. She was a friend who I could always come to when I needed someone to talk to. I felt like I knew her better then anyone else. I guess that's why the song was so familiar. I always felt like I had known her since I was a kid. I was just a kid who was in trouble. I felt like the song was about how I felt at that moment. Her leaving town was the only thing that was going to change my life. I was like a kid waiting for Halloween to come and get me. I felt like I was going to die, a little less then a year ago when she left. That was the only thing that I wanted to change in my life. I also think that the song was about me wanting to be the man that she was. She was a very independent woman and I wanted to be the man that she was. I guess it was just a song about wanting to be the man that she loved.  The lyrics to this song are very strange. "What's it's called baby? Honey my name is Ryan and you're it". I don't know what the song means or what's it's name. I hope it's not going to go on forever.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of "Diamond Girl". The song is about a girl that is in love with a guy.

I think it would be a great song for the radio. I love the song.

I told her that is why I thought it was a Beatles album, because the Beatles are part of the album.  She bought it, but it was too short for her, maybe one song.  She's an excellent Beatles fan, so she loved it.  She's been buying the Beatles' records since the early '60's.  When I told her that this was not a Beatles album, she gave me a big hug and said it was the best Beatles album she has ever heard.  I told her that she had been hearing the Beatles for a long time, and this was the best Beatles album she had ever heard.

Amazon review: I think this album is amazing, but I am not sure I can say why. I believe this album is better than "The Great Unknown" by a considerable margin.

Amazon review: This album was great.

It would be great if I could just listen to their records for free whenever I want, but I will feel guilty if I do.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: I remember liking this song when it was popular 5 yrs ago.  Really stunned at what I heard when I listened to this song and her other work available online from that era (and since).  Am I the only one that thinks she absolutely cannot stay in tune?  She flats out every few bars, she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average.  Overall kind of'meh'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know it's on the radio, but I've never heard it and I am glad I did.  These days I try to listen to more music from other genres.  I have been enjoying this song a lot.  I do have a hard time understanding the words, but I can get the gist of it.  I love it!  I think it is so simple and beautiful.  I can't explain it.  A friend gave me this CD and I am listening to it constantly.  The song is called "You".   I hope this will turn up on the radio.  Enjoy!  I think it is amazing!

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I like that people are getting the word out that this recording exists, and that it is a real life human being that can sing.  I hope one day she finds the people who really want to sing that song, and it shows them the way to do it.  I don't know why this song is only on one station's playlist.  It is a good song and I am enjoying it.  I am glad she has made her audio available.

Amazon review: T.C. Ellis had a brief part in Prince's "Graffiti Bridge" (the album and the movie).  His delivery was excellent, so I was truly looking forward to his solo debut. Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This may be one of my very favorite songs, as it's one of those rare songs that makes you say "Wow!"  And that "Wow!" is due to the beautiful melody and the perfect harmony of the chorus with the guitar line.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: An interesting song for me because I don't know if I can really say anything about it, but I have a strong feeling I will like it.  I love the intro which is very different from most of the songs on the album, and the guitar line is very impressive.  I can't put my finger on what makes this song so special, but for some reason it's just an achingly perfect song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is a great example of the type of song that can only be done by the likes of the Stones.  The song is in fact a blues, but it's a very bluesy, guitar-riff-based song with a slow, easy, groove.  The guitar riffs are very well done and compliment the blues style.  I really liked the song and the album as a whole.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I found this album to be very interesting.  The first song on the album "Get Together" is a good example of how T.C. Ellis and the band can combine a blues jam with a very rock & roll feel.  I enjoyed the song.  I also found the album to be interesting because it has a slower more bluesy feel to it, and the songs have a different feel to them with each song.  Ellis has a very unique style that is very smooth and smooth.  He has a very unique way of rapping that has a very smooth, smooth feel to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really liked the opening track.  It was a blues jam.  I liked the vocals.  The guitar riffs were pretty.  I liked the bass and keyboard.  I liked the drums.  I liked the way the song was played by the band.  It was a very enjoyable song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a very bluesy type of album.  It's not very fast paced and everything is very smooth.  I thought it was interesting because it reminds me of some of the blues I liked.  I didn't like the song "Do You Wanna Go" because it was too slow and I didn't like the guitar riffs.  I don't have a good opinion of "I've Been On The Road" because it was very slow and it had nothing to do with the blues.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I think it's one of the best albums of the year.  This album can be compared to a blues version of an album called "The Essential Journey".  The songs are all very different from each other.  I really liked the beginning of the album which I found very different from the rest of the album.  I thought the album was very interesting and very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first song was something I found interesting because of the guitar riffs.  It was very bluesy and it had a very unique feel to it.  There was a bit of a slow pace to it and it was well played.  "A Little Bit More" was a very good song.  The song was nice and the guitar riffs were very good.  "Come Down" was a very good song which I liked the best.  It just has a very unique feel to it and I like that about it.  "Don't Wait Up" was a good song which I liked the best.  It had a very unique feel and it was very good.  "I've Been on the Road" was a very good song and I liked it very much.  It had a great feel to it and I liked it.  "Ain't Nobody" was a good song which I enjoyed very much.  This song was very good.  This song had a very unique feel to it.  "I Can't Stop Loving You" was my favourite song on this album.

Amazon review: Honestly, I was never a huge fan of this song, the guys voice always seemed kind of whiney to me, but recently my husband mentioned that he loves this song, one of his favorites, he thinks it's really romantic etc.... Not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so I decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix CD for Valentine's day. I've always known the lyrics were romantic, but they have more meaning for me now.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Don't.  It doesn't have vocal tracks in the mix. It's a straight-up repeating beat. When I previewed it, I thought maybe there were no vocals because it was possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample. After all, it lists all of the rappers in the artist column. Wrong. WRONG. I just spent a buck on half of this song. Thanks a ton, whomever came up with this idea.

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

Amazon review: The best album of this band, hands down.  It has the best song in the history of rock music.  It was one of the first albums I bought when it came out.  The song is called "Dirt" and it is one of the best songs ever.  It makes me want to play.  I wish I could play the guitar just like the drummer.  It makes me want to play and listen to this thing.  This is the first album I bought, the second I played.  I have been listening to it over and over.  It's the best album of the year and it was one of the first.  This album is also the first album I bought, the second I played. I have been listening to it again and again.  It's the best album of the year and it was one the first.

Amazon review: I love this album. Every song is great.  I love it so much I wish I had the money to buy the entire album.  There are many other albums I would rather listen to.  I was a fan of the Rolling Stones before this album.  They had me totally sold.  I felt like a little kid again.  I love it with my heart.  I could listen to it all day long.  I love it!  I'm surprised I could stand the sound of the songs without trying to change the speed.  I was always a fan of the song "Shattered" when I first heard it.  It was the only song I could believe could be on the Stones albums.  It was the song that made me fall in love with the Stones.  It is the song that has made every other song sound like it was recorded with a tape recorder.  It is the song that makes me wish I listened to the Stones when I was a kid and had this album.  It is the song that makes me wish I was there at the Stones concert at Red Rocks.  This album is a masterpiece and is the only true masterpiece in the history of the Stones.  It also makes me sad that I was not there when they first played the song, "Shattered." I can't believe I grew up in a world without this album.  I wish I could have been there.  This album is my favorite album of all time.  When I started listening to the Stones I had no idea this album was going to be this good.  Every song is a great song and I can listen to them all day long.  I know this is a negative review but I really hope that you will listen to this album.  There are songs that are incredible and incredible songs that I have never heard before.  This is the greatest album in the history of the rock and roll era.  I love it so much I wish I could buy it.  This album is so powerful and amazing that it puts other albums to shame.  Even if you hate the songs on this album you will always love this album.  The first time I heard this album I was totally blown away.  It completely blew me away.  I fell in love with this album.  This album is not only the greatest album of the rock and roll era, but it is the greatest album of any era.  This album is the greatest album of all time.  This album is the greatest of all time.

Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: I have to admit that I know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre, but in my opinion this is the best one since Britney Spears' cover of Madonna's cover of Marilyn Monroe covering "Happy Birthday" for JFK. It's even above that "Silent Night" one that was re-covered one hundred and eighty times by Nashville artists alone! I know how proud and happy Glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song.

Amazon review: Great version of this tune. This and Dread Zeppelin's version are both very cool for different reasons. However, it is fuzzy sounding, and doesn't quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 seconds. I will try to get a refund. It is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credits of the movie. The visuals add more than you can know.

Amazon review: So I have to admit I really can't get past the fact that I don't know if this song is actually written by Laura Palmer. This song is from Season 2 of the show, and it is one of the main songs that I have always wanted on the show. But, then again, I could be misreading the script. My boyfriend and I watched the show last week. I'm not surprised to hear that the song that I wanted to hear on the show was changed. In fact, I'm surprised that they didn't put it on the album. I don't know, I just think that it's strange that they would change one of their most popular songs for the show. I'm not sure what they were thinking, but, I'm glad they didn't.

Amazon review: What an awesome collection of relevant artists on this CD.  Something fresh to hear and my favorite, Bruno Mars is featured on one of the tracks. If you don't want to buy it to support the producer & artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples. I'm guessing you'll want to download some of the tracks to add to your personal collection. many of them are that good.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: This is still a very fine record, and an excellent example of the kind of music that is sometimes not represented on the radio.  This is also a fine example of a band that can carry an album on their own for a long time; even when other bands are pushing them into a more mainstream, commercial direction.  There are hints of the next great classical composer, and they are very well-crafted.  Even the "classical" stuff has some very good pop melodies.  This is an excellent example of an album that doesn't have to use a single instrument -- which is how it should be.  I especially like the songs with flute, and the band's singing.  There is a lot of space between the songs in this album, and they are all very different.  The best of them all is the last song, which is almost a complete "solo" piece by the band.  I've heard of some band in the past that made a similar album and they were a little better.  This band is on another level.  It is really very well-made.  I hope that the next record will be even better.  It is a good start.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.
