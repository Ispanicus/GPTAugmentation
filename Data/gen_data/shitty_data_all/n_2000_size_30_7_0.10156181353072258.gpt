Buying it here wasn't that smart because I still have not found it on my computer and Amazon help couldn't help me find it. Shrug? I ended up getting it from another website so it doens't really matter I guess.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: There are few bands that can make me listen to them for hours.  The only thing I can say right now is that I've only listened to a few albums by this band and the name of the album is a spoiler.  The music is excellent, it's just that the lyrics don't make any sense at all.  Not only that, but the songs are all different so one song is totally different from the next.  I'm done with this band!  Don't listen to this album, it's not worth it!

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Missy Elliot and Kelly Roland. Missy's voice is so soft, and Kelly's voice is so powerful to. There isn't much you can do in these situations to stop them from singing. The Fantasia song is just one of these situations where the song choice was very bad. I just didn't feel like the song was good enough. It was not a bad song, it just didn't stand out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just got this album and I am very disappointed. I have just listened to it twice and I don't believe that I like it. The song I liked the best was the one where she sings "I Don't Mind" and it was awesome! I believe that this album is just a filler material for Missy, just to sell more copies. Her voice is so good (and she is a great singer) and I am disappointed that she made two songs I don't like, the one song I like the best, I think is going to be the best song of the album!

Amazon review: I just recently purchased this album and I have to tell you that it was a waste of time. The first song is so boring and the song I like the best is the song "Without Me". The song was great and the only other song I like was the song "I Don't Mind". It was good but the rest of the album was just not worth listening to at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think Fantasia was the best singer that I have ever heard. This is just one of her songs you will never hear on the radio. I love her voice and her songs.

Amazon review: I just bought this album and I am pleasantly surprised that I liked it. I loved the song "I Don't Mind". The first song on the album "I Don't Mind", I thought was not a very good song but I found that it was great nonetheless. I think that this album will be a good one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am just a little disappointed. I wanted to be happy that I had bought this record, but I was not. The song I liked the best on the album was the song "I Don't Mind". I also liked the song "Without Me". These two songs made me feel really good through the whole album. I liked the song "I Don't Mind" in particular. It was very good. I also thought that the song "I Don't Mind" was very good. I think that this album is good, there are some good songs on it. The last song to be on the album, "Wrecking Ball" was not very good. The song is very fast and repetitive. It was not really good. It was very annoying. I think that this album is good overall. I have listened to several other Fantasia songs on the radio and they are all good. This one is not. I really would not recommend this album to anyone. It is good, but it is just not worth listening to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have just listened to this album twice and I don't find it very good. I never bought any Fantasia album before this one. I thought it would be just as good as her second album. It just wasn't. I feel like Fantasia was a very, very good singer, but this album is just not. I didn't like this album at all. I really don't like this album. I don't think it is good. I don't feel like I will purchase this album any time soon. I am sorry that I didn't listen to this album first, but I am glad that I listened to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard this album on the radio and was very impressed. I have a lot of Fantasia songs, but I've never heard one that is this good. "I Don't Mind" is really beautiful and I would love to hear her sing it on the radio someday. "I'll Be There For You" is the best song

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.

Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: I was in the middle of the second album.  I listened to it a couple of times, but I wasn't hooked.  I know, I know, it's just one song, but it was just one song that stood out to me.  It was my favorite song on the album.  And,  that's the only song that really stands out to me.  I did listen to the other songs a little bit, but I just didn't really care for them.  I liked the album a lot, but it didn't grab me like the song did.  I just didn't really care for it.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of this band from the get-go.  They are my all-time favorite band, and I listen to them on a regular basis.  The first time I heard them, I was hooked.  The second time, I was hooked for good.  I loved the sound of the band, and the songs.  The whole thing was just amazing.  I was really happy to see that they were still going strong.  I have loved their music for almost 10 years now, and I'm super excited to see what happens next.

Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.  I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Hall &Oates and have been since I was 13. This is one of my favorite albums as well. The band itself is amazing. You can tell they put a lot of thought into this album. The vocals are very well done with the piano in the background. The music and lyrics are just cool. It's a different kind of blues that I've never heard before.

Amazon review: Just received this CD & loved it immediately. I love the fact that they put out so many different styles for their albums. This is all at the same time. I was initially a fan of this band because of the different styles they put out, but now I like the fact that they put out so many different types of music. I love the fact that you can have everything from folk to rock to jazz to funk to country to ballads to everything in between. The music is amazing. Hall &Oates are one of those bands that can make you think, feel, and live. They put out an album every year that is just as good as the one from two years ago. This is one of my new favorite artists and I will definitely continue to listen to their albums. I also like the cover art, it's very unique and I like the title track.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album since I was a kid and each time it takes me back.  Forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music.  I love that it takes ancient songs we all know and love and puts pure soul into them.  My favorite tracks are the Overture, Every Valley, Lift Up Your Heads, And He Shall Purify and of course Halleujah.  All I can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why I love Christmas and the holiday season.

Amazon review: Since I grew up in an extremely remote part of Alaska, I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't very exposed to the Bee Gees' music in the Seventies. I was only familiar with "Lonely Nights" from a mix album of my parents and I had no idea who the artists were. In my twenties I ventured out into the world and heard "Stayin' Alive" and other disco hits without really paying much attention. In my thirties I had dinner at my parents' house and afterwards they watched an A&E special concert promoting the Bee Gees album, "This is Where I Came In.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the Bee Gees but I never realized how good "Stayin' Alive" was until I bought this album in 1983. I was really disappointed with the music in this album. I can't say any of the songs were all that great. I didn't really like the album. It's kind of boring. The album has a few decent songs like "Stayin' Alive" and "Lonely Nights." This album was not the greatest album ever but it was the best album the band ever made.

Amazon review: I can't believe someone actually has this album without knowing who the artist is.. I always have been a fan of the Bee Gees, but I have never listened to this album until a few years ago. I have heard "Hallelujah," "Stayin' Alive," "Love Bites" and "Lonely Nights" before. I can't say that I like any of these songs as much as the songs I've heard before, but I had never heard "Stayin' Alive" until just recently.

Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: I like this song, but I can't stand it when the vocalist just says "oh" and "yeah".  I know they're singing, but it's just annoying, especially when it's just one word.  I like the song, but I would love to hear a better version of this song.  The vocalist is great though!

I listened to a lot of flamenco and it's kind of hard to get into it.  I'm a little disappointed that it wasn't so much flamenco as reggae, but it's still pretty good.  The reggae is actually pretty good.  My favorite song is "Gimme A Chance" but it's been on repeat a lot.  So I'll probably re-listen to it.

So I went to the record store and was looking for something to take my mind off the problems I was having at work.  I bought this for $13.00.  I'm listening to it right now.  It actually sounds pretty good.  Actually, if you listen to the album it sounds better.  The vocal is really pretty.  The instrumentation is pretty good.  I'm not a fan of reggae, but I think it's a pretty good record.  I like a good reggae album.  I like the fact that it's not in the same category as the other reggae albums.  For example, this is a little softer for reggae, there are a lot of keyboards in it.  But I like it. I'll probably listen to it again.  Maybe I'll bring it back with me to Florida.

For example, it's a little softer than other reggae, it has a lot of keyboards, but it's still really good, and it's not just reggae.  I like the fact that it's not in the

Amazon review: My son came to me one day with tears in his eyes playing this song on his phone. He said he only had one request of me, "Dad, promise me that if I should pass before you that you'll play song at my funeral." Well what could I say but, "Only if you'll do the same for me son."  Very touching day for us. Thanks Guys.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: Why do artists forget what really made them famous in the first place. If your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like I was you'll be very disappointed. At times the electric and slide guitars completely drown out the singing. Other times the music fades in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad. I did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album. I thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not really sure what to say about this album.  I know you need to have a song on there to get someone to buy a CD.  I know David Soul is a great artist and one of my favorite singers.  But this just doesn't seem like something that would be able to capture the hearts and minds of people.  I'm not saying it's a bad album, it's just not an album I would listen to.  It's just not the type of album I'd expect to find in a David Soul release.  I have a lot of praise for the guy, but not this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is about David Soul showing his love for his fans.  His fans don't have a voice.  They want a voice so they can sing the songs along with him.  He shows his love for his fans.  He shows his love for his life.  He shows his love for his family.  He shows his love for the music that he loves.  He sings about the music that he loves.  It's not about him and his fans.  It's about his fans.  It's about him and his life.  This album was just a little too real in the end.  There's a song about a man losing his loved one.  That's what the song is about.  David Soul tries to capture the reality of a life that he loved so much that he lost it.  The recording is just a little too real.  The music is just a little too real.  The lyrics are just a little too real.  The arrangements are just a little too real.  This is a great album that I wish the world could be a little more like.  I wish I could have a life like David Soul.  I wish I could have a life on the road like David Soul.  I wish that I could have a life like David Soul.  And if you're thinking that it's a little too real for this album, don't be surprised when I make fun of it because I will.  I'll probably write a negative review where I mock it because I don't think it's good enough.  I'll probably buy this album and give it to my wife to listen to and tell her how great it is.

Amazon review: This is a great album when it's all about David Soul.  I'm not a huge David Soul fan.  I love him as a musician, but I don't really love him as a singer and I think he's a little too over the top for me.  He has a great voice, but his singing style is just so over the top and I'm not sure it's a good style for a David Soul album.  It's just too much of a distraction from the rest of the album.  I really enjoy the album when David Soul is singing about a man, woman, or child who dies.  It's just too much of a distraction from the album.  I would have liked to have heard more about some of the songs like "If I Can Dream" and "I'll Give You Everything".  And then "I Wish I Was Your Everything".  And I would have liked to have heard more about "The Love You Put In It".  And "If I Could Be A Boy" is just too much of a distraction for me.  I'd have liked to have heard more of those songs too.  I'm not sure if you could ever tell what song is the best of the songs or what songs are the best songs.  I like the tracks that are the best songs on the record.  I like the tracks that are the best songs on the record and then some songs that are the best songs that I like.  David Soul's songs seem to be the best songs on the record.  I liked "Don't Give Up On Us Baby" and "I Wish I Was Your Everything".  I liked "I'll Be There" and "I'll Be There For You" too.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoy David Soul and I think he's a great singer.  I don't think it's bad for him to sing a song and show off his voice.  It's just that there's too much of his voice all over the record and it's just not good enough.  I think the best songs on the record are the songs that are about a man, woman, or child who dies.  But I don't think it's a good enough song to be on the record.  I'd have preferred to hear David Soul sing a song that was a little more about his life than his music.  I'd prefer to hear him sing a song about what it's like to be a man

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: The title is misleading. This is not a collection of "50 Essential Songs from the Beatles" (and for the record, I don't really know why they thought it was a collection).

There are several that are not on any other Beatles recordings from that period.

Amazon review: This is an excellent set of Beatles songs with excellent sound quality that you cannot find on any other Beatles collection.

If you're looking for a great Beatles collection, this is a great place to start.

Amazon review: This is really a good album, but it is more "The Yellow Submarine" than "The Beatles." It is not about the Beatles in a sense that they were so great in their own right, but about the times they were in. The songs are interesting and they are all very good, but it is the sound quality that makes this a great album. There is no way I can give this one a 5 star rating. The only songs I can give any rating for are "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill" and "I Don't Know How to Love Him."

Amazon review: So, Band of Horses is a new band to me. Suffice to say, it's now as if I've been a fan for years. Their songs are infectious, as they're deep and meaningful. The instrumentation, vocals, and composition are fantastic. What a song.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

Amazon review: Maiden was one of the first bands to really rock. It didn't really have the same sound like all the other bands, but it was rock n roll. I was a big fan of this band for several years. I went to see them twice. Their music was great, and I was proud to be associated with them. However, after hearing their new album, "Iron Maiden" I was forced to change my mind about them. Their music is not what I remember. I had always liked them, but after hearing this album I did not. It was the worst album of the new millennium, and I had to change my mind. I no longer liked Maiden, but I will continue to always think of them and everything they did.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound of Maiden is amazing. It's hard to describe this music in words, but it's definitely in the style of Queen, Led Zeppelin or Kiss, but with a little bit more of a thrash feel. The vocals and lyrics are some of the best out there.

###
Amazon review: Maiden are an amazing band, and always will be. Since I can remember, I always knew Maiden as a band. I have always loved their music, and I always loved them. When I heard the name "Iron Maiden" I thought it was the most interesting name. I was really excited to hear their new album, and I was even more excited when I found out that they had a new singer. I really like the singer, Richard Taylor, and I think he's a great singer. Maiden is one of my favorite bands.

Amazon review: There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has been a lot of the news lately, and not for her music. It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split.

The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.

Amazon review: I'm really disappointed with this album. I thought it would be good but it isn't. There are some great songs on here but I would say the only one that I thought was good was Lately. I know it's not the best song on the album but I just think the song is really good.

Amazon review: I bought this album 3 weeks ago and I'm already bored with it. The beats are okay. The beats are just okay. The riddim is nothing special. The lyrics are good but I won't lie the songs I like the most are the ones that have the most beat, the ones with the best lyrics or the most hook. The song I don't really like is the one that has the best beat. The lyrics are ok. The riddim is average to good. I would give this album 5 stars if I could give it 5 stars.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: Disappointing; very much MOR type music. Not what I had hoped for, sadly.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First, I must say that if you are a fan of the classical music of the 50's it may sound like you have never listened to the music of Yes.  But then again, Yes may have influenced a very few artists such as Pink Floyd, The Who, The Kinks, and Yes.  This compilation is a great way to learn about Yes, which is by far my favorite band of all time.  I would also recommend anyone who is unfamiliar with classical music of the 50's to learn about Yes.  These are two different worlds and this compilation shows a great way to cross over from one to the other.

I have heard many great compilations such as "The Best of The Beatles," "The Best of Led Zeppelin," "The Best of Pink Floyd," "The Best of Genesis," "The Best of The Beatles."

The songs are very diverse and I recommend those who love rock music to this compilation.  "Roundabout" is a great song, and the vocals are very good.  This is a very good compilation.

Amazon review: I was looking for strictly Disney songs to be played by strings, no singing. The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs "Colors of the Wind", "A Whole New World" and "Beauty and the Beast" all had terrible singers singing along. I don't understand why it is "101 Strings Ochestra" and then singing for a few of the songs. It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental.

The album is called "The Circle."

Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length.

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

I haven't listened to it for years, but I have been listening to it ever since.  I thought that the album was really good, but this song really stood out to me, it was so good.

What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike.
