Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed. I was looking forward to this, it had a great cover, was in great shape. I received this after reading the reviews. It was in a bag, not in case, no protective sleeve. The sleeve that was sent was very small, if any there was no way to open and close the flap, it wouldn't close! I'll never buy this album again.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album. I bought it on my birthday as a gift for my brother. I've listened to it several times and it never sounded better. I have a feeling that my brother just didn't like it and didn't want it. No, I don't think it's terrible, but it just doesn't stand out in any category. The music is good, but the lyrics and story are all just forgettable. I don't think it'll ever get old, but I'm glad it's out of my collection. I would have loved to have given it to him as a present. This album is just a disappointment.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon rating: 4 stars.  Good song, but not a great one.  Not the best album, but not the worst either.  This was a good purchase, but I can't say it was much better than the other CDs (which I have).  I've bought a lot of albums from the band and have never returned to purchase anything from them.  At least they don't take any of my money for another album.

Amazon rating: 4 stars:  It was a good buy for the price.  There are some little things, but overall it's a good CD.  It could have been better, but then again I'm sure they could do better.  The CD plays better at high volumes than most CD players.

It's a good CD, but it's not a great one.  I liked some of the other songs too.  I wish they had performed more songs but hey, they're not in the top 50 of any one genre.  I just bought this CD because I wanted a "Greatest hits" album as opposed to a "best of" album.  This CD is great, but that's what I got.  The whole album is great, but that's what I got.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good cd.  I really enjoy this cd.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the singer is too high-pitched, but I guess they wanted to be on top.  I wish they were a little more quiet.  Maybe they could get a different singer.  I'm not sure what they want to be on top of.  I don't like it.  I wish they were a little more quiet.  I like some of the other songs too.  I wish they sang more of her songs, the singing is fine and the other songs are alright, but this one is a little too high-pitched for me.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: What a complete waste of time. I have listened to this album for the past 10 years and it is by far the worst album ever. If you like rock music, you should not waste your time on this album, because this album is horrible. There are songs that are great, but the rest are just terrible. This album is truly awful. The only reason why I continue to listen to it is because it is on an old cassette tape. I have been listening to it for years.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album for a long time. There are songs, like "Comfortably Numb", that I really like. The rest of the album is okay. The songs are usually pretty good, but the vocals just don't cut it for me. I feel like they should have sung songs like "The Great Gig in the Sky" instead of "The Dark Side of the Moon".

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: The first thing I like about this album is the music; it's just so fucking good. The vocals are great, the guitar solos are great, the drums are great, the bass is great, and the riffs are great. I enjoy listening to these songs over and over again. One thing about this album that I don't like is that the song "Rattle" is pretty, but I don't like how it's played; the bass is too loud, the drums are too quiet, and the vocals are too slow. The song ends out and there is no guitar solo, so it comes to a weird ending. This is another Slipknot album I don't get.

Amazon review: This is the best album of Slipknot yet. Every song is a masterpiece. The guitar solos are amazing, and the drums are amazing. I can't believe that they're not on the album. The vocals are great, so are the riffs, and the solos are great. But it doesn't have the songs or the energy you expect from Slipknot, and it's just not as good as this album. I think this album is better than the first album, but not as good as the last two.

Amazon review: This is the best album of SlipkNOT yet. I listened to this album over and over. I really want to listen to it again. The song "Seek and Destroy" is one of my favorites from this album. I don't like the song "The Saturation" because it doesn't sound like Slipknot. I don't like the song "The Saturation" because it has a very high speed in the chorus. I like the song "Seek and Destroy" because it's one of the best songs from the band.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

It's a good album.  I hope it was worth the money and you like it.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what a true hip-hop album is, but I did not think this was one. I do not understand who would pay for this album. I think it would have been better if it was a mix of all of Dre's solo albums, not just Chronic.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the music of J.D. Crowe from the start of his ministry.  I love how he uses the classic spiritual songs and applies them to his worship and ministry.  The songs that I have been listening to are "I'll Be Here Until You Come" and "The Power of the Cross".  I am a worship band, and I think that the music ministry of J.D. Crowe and Fireflight is something that I am going to enjoy for a long time.

Amazon review: I have to say that I am very impressed with this ministry.  I think that they are doing something that is going to bless many people, and I know that they are doing it with the Lord's help.  They have an amazing worship band called "Fireflight".  I have listened to them on CD before and now I am listening on CD again.  I am excited to see what God has in store for me.

With a growing interest in music, I have found that the best way to satisfy my craving is through the worship music I listen to.  I have found that many of these songs have a very positive message.  I love to listen to the lyrics and know that God is teaching me His truths through the music I hear.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I was not satisfied with the first Korn album.  I thought it was a step in the right direction, but by the second album, my expectations were met with disappointment.  The most disappointing thing to me was that I didn't like the sound that the band's sound engineer, Michael Borkow, had managed to achieve.  I was hoping that the band would achieve a more mature sound, but instead, they chose a sound that was less accessible to me.  After this album, I will not be buying any future Korn CDs  I will be waiting for a new record from the band.  I may even go out of my way to purchase a CD from them if it is as good as this latest effort.  I would rate this album a 10/10  My favorite song is "Mountain Man"

It's really bad and it's too bad that they have no talent.  I feel bad for them because I had to buy the album.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have trouble keeping this CD on.  The singing is dreadful. Her voice is horrible.  It sounds like she is calling the devil.  My kids leave when it is on.  I can not recommend this CD, it's just not good.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Lady Gaga.  She's just so sexy!  I would love for her to go on tour with the 'Glee' troupe.  I know she's done the show, but she would be a great guest star.  I saw her perform at the MTV Music Video Awards and she was so sexy.  I want to see her in concert.  I wish her a lot of luck.  She is a great artist.  She's a lot more talented than I am.  I don't know if I can ever be as good as her.  I can't even sing.  I'm not even sure if I can write a song.  I don't know how to write a happy song.  I'd be glad to help her out and write her a song.  I would be glad to help her out and write her a song.  I can't wait for the day I can help out someone and write them a song.

Amazon review: There's something wrong with this song, and it's disturbing: The singer is a complete mess, her voice sounds like a machine, and she sounds like she's drunk.  If this is what she is capable of, I would really hate to be her fans.  There's no redeeming value to this song.  It's a waste of time.  There's nothing good to say about this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this song!  It's soooo cute and happy!  The only thing is that the lyrics are a bit hard to understand.  When I first heard this song, I thought it was nice.  But, after a bit more listening, I felt bad for the singer, because I don't think she can really sing!  It's a shame, because I wish she'd sing more and do better songs!  I would be glad to help her out, and write her a song!  I don't know how I'd write a happy song.  I'd be glad to help her out, and write her a happy song.  I don't know what song I would write for her.

Amazon review: This does not seem to be a bad song just a song with bad lyrics.  I don't like most of Lady Gaga's songs.  I don't know what it is about her music that I don't like.  I think it's really weird.  I'm not exactly sure what I believe in, but I know I don't want to be a part of her world.  I'm not sure what I believe in, but I know I don't want to live the life she lives.  I'm not exactly sure what I believe in, but I don't like her music.  I don't like her song "The Fame".  I think it's weird.
