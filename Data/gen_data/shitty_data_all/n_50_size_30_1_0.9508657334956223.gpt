Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It is a very good collection of songs that has been repacked.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I purchased this because it was recommended to me by a friend.  However after a few songs I realized it was one CD too many.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

It's a nice change to hear a singer with a voice like her singing for the first time and with a more mature approach to singing. And to be honest, the song does get a little boring towards the third verse so I don't think I will get into the whole 'heaven' part of the song. I don't think I will be buying this album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jewel since her very first album. Now her album is here and I am just not sure if I like it. I love the ballads she puts on the album that I really connects with. But I just don't think that she has really matured her singing style at all. The song is the same. And I am definitely not a fan of her live shows. Her voice is just not that awesome. I will listen to her CD. But I definitely won't buy any of her albums.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of Jewel. I thought I was going to like this album. I thought it would be a good change from the other Jewel albums. The songs are very slow and quiet, and I can't help but think that she is taking this album a little too much too fast and trying to force it to sound like something she doesn't know how to do. I feel she is trying to force the album into a format that it doesn't fit. I just don't like her music.

Amazon review: I am so happy that I finally got my hands on Jewel's new album! I've been a fan of Jewel since her very first album. I love the ballads she puts on the album that I really connected with. I remember the song 'The Sun Always Shines On Me', and how I cried to that song as a kid. I think I'll probably still love every Jewel song, except the ones from this album. It's a nice change to hear a singer with a beautiful voice singing for the first time and with a more mature approach to singing. I also like that the songs are slower, so they don't get stuck in your head the way some pop songs do. And to be honest, the song doesn't really get to the "heaven" part of the song. I don't think I'll be buying this album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I would highly recommend this CD to all fans of this great genre.  These boys play some pretty funky music. The album has a nice balance between the traditional and the alternative with some nice funky tunes.  The only negative thing I have to say about this album is that the songs are a little too long.    What I liked about this CD is that,  it has a great vibe, that can make it a listen that you can play in your car as you drive by a field or in the park.    The music is a little too long for me, but I don't think I will be changing my CD selection to buy other albums from this group.    In my opinion,  the group has a lot of potential, but as with any live act,  their lack of experience with recording technology can be a problem.    I would recommend this CD if you are a fan of the blues and are looking for some funky music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since the first time I heard their music back in the early 90s (I  am now in my 50s, so it's not like I have been listening to them and not paying much attention).  I have been hearing the band play for the past few years and the songs  keep getting better and better.  The band is still as good as they have ever been.  This is a GREAT CD.  I don't know if they are going to continue to make new releases, but the first three that I have heard are awesome.  I would not put them in the same category as any other band, but I think are a great band.  The sax player is always a treat to listen to.  I give them five stars!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a regular fan of the band for many years.  The band has been around for 20+ years.  They are a group of guys who play with a passion for what they do.  I have seen them live several times and  I can say that the band is a very tight group.  I would not consider them to be a 'big band' because their music is more like traditional jazz.

I am not a big fan of blues and this band did not disappoint.

Amazon review: Well, this is not a new CD by any means.  I have been a huge fan of the band for years and they have been at my favorite albums for years as well.

They are still as good as I have ever heard them.

Amazon review: I have heard that this is the first single from the album from the same year. It's an upbeat, happy, catchy, simple-yet-catchy song. I've heard that you can listen to it at any time of day (or whenever you feel like it), although the lyrics are very, very clear. It's a "love you" song, and I personally believe that love is the best medicine. I love it as much as the next, but I don't think it's going to be my song of the moment.

I was really surprised at how much I did not like this song. I thought I would be a fan from the get go. It didn't turn out that way. The opening is good, the first verse is ok, the chorus is ok, the second verse is good, the rest of the song is just too boring. Maybe it's the kind of song that you can't expect to like.

I'm glad that you didn't like it. I was having trouble believing that someone would like it so much. I guess I shouldn't listen to what I think is good music all the time. That's what I was trying to tell myself at first. However, I don't care what people think

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: There were a few moments during this program where I seriously thought I was going to pass out, but I didn't.  It was a powerful experience that blew my mind.  The way the instructor made the use of breathing exercises to get a "feel" of the song, was just mind blowing.  He was able to make me feel like I was singing along in a way that I have never done before.  I have done "chorus" singing before, but it was never this intense. It was almost like I was singing out of my brain as opposed to anything else, or some "thing" that I was singing out of.  But I guess that is not really the point.  The point is that it made me feel like I was actually singing the song.  It was like "Wow, I am actually singing my own song" in a way that I have never done.  For those who are not familiar with this style of singing, this is called "Mindfulness".  It is a very powerful technique to be able to get a "feel" of the song, as well as the lyrics.  The technique itself is simple, very easy to do, and is a great way to help one learn the song.  The best thing is, it can be done anywhere and anytime.  You can just go into the kitchen, or the restroom, or even while doing something else.  It is a "do as I say, not as I do" kind of thing.  I learned this from a friend who would teach the technique.  The fact that this can be done with any instrument is a huge plus.  You can sing any song you want, and the technique will transfer to any recording.  I hope this helps.

Amazon review: I am a very big fan of the new Taylor Swift.  I have been a fan of her since her first album came out.  I listened to it over and over again.  I would sit and listen to it in between work and school and I would listen to it at night.  It is just a great song that I fell in love with.  But, I have to say, I was not as impressed with Taylor as her dad, but that might be because she is a very young woman.  I mean, she is a teenager that can't be expected to know what she wants, or what she is doing.  But, her dad clearly knows what she wants to be and where she wants to go.  But, I think he was just being a dad and letting her know that her voice is in good shape, while she is still in high school.  I think he would be proud of the song he has put out with his daughter, but that is just my opinion.  I think she has potential, and I am sure she will grow into it.  I like Taylor.  I like her voice.  I like her style.  I think it is a good choice for her father to be the one that releases this song.  I think he is smart enough to know that Taylor will be a superstar.  I think he is wise to do what he thinks is best for his daughter.  I just have a really hard time with the fact that she is a teenager and should be able to choose what she wants to be.  She is such a cute little thing and she is just growing up.
