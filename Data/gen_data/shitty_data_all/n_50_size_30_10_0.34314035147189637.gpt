Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Twiztid  is not a bad album at all, my recommendation is that you try to get it from iTunes or other music store before buying it. The album is enjoyable for the first 5 to 7 songs.  Then it becomes repetitive and annoying.  However, if you are willing to listen to this album for the first time, go ahead and buy it. It's not horrible, just mediocre.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This was another great album, and it's so good that it makes me question the existence of God. The album is excellent, but the one or two songs that I thought were outstanding, were the last ones on the album.  This is why many Christian music fans are so confused as to why the Christian music industry is in the state that it is. The industry is in a constant battle with the devil and cannot avoid that.  It's just too easy for a "Christian" to listen to a Christian album and think that it's Christian and therefore good.  I have no problem with them listening to a Christian album, because it's the only way that they will know if what they listen to is Christian or not.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I really enjoyed the album. All the songs were good.  I just have to tell you that the album is so full of fluff and garbage that it makes me want to throw it at the wall.  This album is full of the same stuff from all the other albums.  I am not an expert or anything, but I thought it was pretty good.  I would probably like this album a lot more if it had a little more substance to it.  But then again, I don't have too much to say about this album, I just like it.

Amazon review:  I really really do not understand the hype around this album.  It is not bad, and it is not really good either.  I wish I had the money to buy the album in stores.  I am a fan of the band and I do not think they deserve to be hounded by the media to buy the album.  Their fans deserve better.  I do not understand how the "Christian" music fans and the Christian record industry as a whole have managed to get themselves into the position they are in.  To me this album is as guilty as they come for being a "Christian" band.  I am a Christian, and I respect this band and their music.  This album is not Christian, and I am glad that I found the album.  I am glad I found the album, because I think it is the only good thing I can find on this album.  I do not like the songs on this album, because they are horrible.  I did not like the music, but I am glad that I am a fan of the band and that I have found this album.   I have to say that I do not understand why this band has to go around rapping about how Jesus died for you and how you can forgive and love people.  I think they should be grateful for what they have and leave it at that.  I do not understand why they are so obsessed with Christianity.  I also do not understand why they are so obsessed with the idea of being a Christian.  I think that the band is sincere and I think that they are trying to do the best for their fans who are Christians.  The problem is that they do not tell you that the song is about the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  I could not understand why they had to go around and put up a sign that says "This song is about Jesus and the Bible" on their website.  The song is not about Jesus, it is about how the band is anointed by God.  I also get confused why they put up a video of a guy getting stoned and making a sign that says, "God Bless You with God's Grace and Mercy."  It makes no sense.  I have to say that I do not understand why the Christian music industry is in the state it is.  The record industry is in a constant battle with the devil and cannot avoid that. It's just too easy for a "Christian" to listen to a "Christian" album and think that it's "Christian" and therefore good.

And why put out an album of 10 songs?  Why release 50 songs when you can put out an album an album of 50 songs?  Why put out

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

I was born in the year of the Horse, the most popular horse in the world, the one with the big white blaze on its head, the one that can move in any direction, the one that always walks with the trot and the canter. And I have been there many times, and I have seen many things. I have had many adventures, many adventures from the horse.
And as a child I was raised with a love for horses, which made me love the people that I met. When I was 11, I got my first horse, a horse with a big white blaze on its head, a horse that could move in any direction, that always walked with the trot and the canter. It was this horse who taught me how to ride. It taught me to walk and to trot and to canter. And I have been there many times, and I have been there for many adventures, for many adventures from the horse. And as a child I was raised with a love for horses, which made I love the people that I met. And as I grew older I learned what it was that made us love each other. But I learned that it wasn't just about love for a horse, it was also about love for a friend. And I learned that there could be no friendship without love. And I learned that friendship was not something that just happened to me. It was something that I had to learn to make, something that I had to learn to create. And I learned that if I didn't learn to create friendship between myself and my horse, then I would never find the friendship that I needed. And I learned that if I could find true friendship with myself, then I would find true friendship in the world. And I learned that true friendship was not something that just happened to me. True friendship was something that I had to create, something that I had to learn to make. And I learned that if I could find true friendship in myself, then I would find true friendship in the world. And I would learn to love myself, because I learned that I was not just born with a love for a horse, but I was born with a love for myself. And I learned that true friendship was not something that just happened to you. It was something that you had to make, something that you had to learn to create. And I learned that true friendship was not something that just happened to the horse, it was something that I had to learn to make, something that I hadto learn to create. And I learned that true friendship was not something that I just met, something that just happened to me. It was something that I had to make, something that I had to learn to create. And I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to me. And I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to the horse. And I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to the friendship that only happened to the horse. And I knew that true friendship was not something that just happened to me, but it was something that I had to create, something that I had to learn. And I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to me, because I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to the horse. So I learned that true friendship was something that only happened to me. And I learned that true friendship was something that only happened to the horse. And I learned that true friendship was something that only happened to the friendship that only happened the horse. And I learned that true friendship was something that only happened because I was born with a love for myself. And I learned that true friendships was something that only happened because I was born with a love for myself and a love for the horse. And I learned that true friendship was something that only happened, because I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to me. And so I learned that true friendship was something that only happened to me. And so I knew that true friendship was something that only happened to me. And that true friendship was something that only happened because I was born with a desire to love myself. And that true friendship was something that only happened because I was born to love myself. And that true friendship was something that only happened because of my desire to love myself and the horse.

Amazon review: I find the first song to be boring and the second song is alright at best.  I do like the chorus and the rap at the beginning although the song should be titled "I don't know if I'm ever gonna see you again".  The album as a whole is a waste of time.  I would rather listen to the first two songs and then listen to a song or two from this album that's more original in nature.

The worst song is probably the second one titled "I don't know if I'm ever gonna see you again."

If you don't like it then you can just keep listening to it and not waste your time.

I couldn't care less about the song because I'm not even listening to the song.  I don't care about the song because I'm about to go sleep.  I don't care about the song because I'm going to be a teenager for the next 10 years to see how I feel about it.  I don't care about the song because it's the last song on the album.  I don't care about the song because I don't want to hear from people like this anymore.  I don't care about the song because I don't want people to know how much I hate Twiztid and the rest of their band.  I don't care about the song because I'm so full of shit and I don't want to come back to it.  I don't care about the song because I'm going to go into this music thing I have chosen to do and it will be the best thing I've ever done.  I don't care about the song because I'm going to turn into a bitter man who hates anything and anyone who doesn't agree with me.  I don't care about the song because I'm now stuck with all the songs on this album.  I don't care about the song because all I ever want to do is play this song and not have to listen to any of these other songs.  I don't care about the song because I'm in the middle of the worst teenage phase I've ever experienced and I don't want to think about it.  I don't care about the song because I want to get up and leave the room, forget about it, and go to sleep.  I don't care about the song because I'm bored and I'm done listening to it.  I don't care about the song because I'm starting to not care about anything.  I don't care about the song because I'm starting to feel like a complete piece of shit.  I don't care about the song because I want to go to bed.  I don't care about the song because I'm done listening to it.  I don't care about the story because I'm starting to not care about the story.  I don't care about the story because I'm getting bored and I'm done listening to it.

It was a very difficult decision to leave a job I had for over a year with a company in which I didn't enjoy and one that had a lot of "bad" reviews I had to do something else. It was very difficult for me to leave that job. I'm glad I did. I'm glad I finally found my passion in life.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD and listened to it for about an hour.  The only thing that I really could detect is that the band and singer sound like, well,  a boy band.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I don't care what anyone says.  My favorite guitarist in all of music history.  A man with no fear.  A man who played the blues with the passion of a young man and the passion of an old man.  A man who wanted to bring back the blues, but sadly, we all know blues don't exist anymore.  His music was the blues.  His life was the blues.  His music is the blues.  His life is the blues.  His music is the blues.  His life is one to remember.  I will never forget the last time I saw him play at the historic Hotel del Coronado.  It was a Saturday night at 8:30 p.m.  I was there to see my wife and children.  I had no plans to see my favorite blues guitarist.  He was there to see his daughter.  But they were there.  He was there.  He was there.  He was there.  He came to see me.  He was there.  He was there.  He came for me.  It was a night of joy.  It was a night I will never forget.  It was a night I will never forget.  It was the night of the blues.  It was a night I will never forget.  It was my night.  It was the night of the blues.  It was my night.  It was the night of the Blues.  It was my night.  It was the night of the songs.  It was my night.  It was the night of the music.

Lyrics - A Night in the Life of a Dog

I'm a dog And it's all I ever want To be a dog and walk along the beach And every night I fall asleep on my bed And every day I get up to a new adventure And the life we share Is the kind of life I might one day live And I have no intention of ever letting it go And as long as I'm a dog And the life we share Is the kind of life I might one day lead

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Wow.  I never realized how much I love this artist until the moment I heard her.  I was amazed, amazed, amazed by her amazing vocals and singing, all the while her amazing songwriting that encompasses all of her life experiences.   I felt like I was listening to a young, fresh new artist.   The first time I listened to her I was blown away.  Her songs are not just beautiful but they also have a tremendous amount of emotion, intelligence and creativity.   I would like to give a shout out to Miss Lin Manuel Miranda, and her entire team for their incredible work and talent.

Amazon review: So this is a review of The Libera Project - Lin Manuel Miranda: A New Day on Broadway written by Lin Manuel Miranda and performed by the Lin Manuel Miranda Band.  I bought this record, and I am a huge fan, and I am pretty sure I saw her play in the theater in my hometown of Cleveland Ohio.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
