Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: This song is not bad.  It's not great.  It's not boring.  It's just so-so.  It doesn't move me, it doesn't interest me, it's not funny at all.  It's a mediocre song.  It's a great song to listen to while you're waiting in line at the bank because it gets you in the mood to get your check and go to the ATM.  2 stars.

Amazon review:"Love Will Find A Way" is Lenny Kravitz at his most generic.  It's not bad, but it doesn't wow me.  It's a generic song that has been done by the likes of Ashlee Simpson and Celine Dion.  It's a dud.  That's the only way I could describe it.  2 stars.

I wasn't the least bit surprised.  It is one of his best.  I can't say much for the lyrics.  I thought some of them were good.  The song is great.  It's great.  The music is great.  It's not so great.  It's not terrible.  It's not good.  It's not bad.  It's good.  It's not bad.  It's one of those songs that is just so-so.  2 stars.

The opinions expressed in this review of Lenny Kravitz's fifth studio album, Mama Don't Let Me Go, are not necessarily the opinions of Adult DVD Talk. Adult DVD Talk provides a public forum for consumers to post their DVD reviews. Adult DVD Talk does not edit these reviews.

This album is great, I think your point of the song being one of the best on the album is valid. Lenny is just a great singer, I love his voice. My favorite song on the album is "Mama Don't Let Me Go". The song was so good...I just wish it had more of a message. I am glad the album was released on cd as it was such a great release.
The only problem with this album is the lyrics. If you can't understand the lyrics, then you probably won't like the song. There are so many different lyrics. The only lyrics I could understand were "I don't know what to do".
If you don't like the song, then don't listen to it. If you can understand the lyrics,

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I was in the car driving home from work and I was listening to "Just the Way You" by Toni Braxton.  The first time I heard this song it was on the radio and I wanted to hear it.  A friend bought it for me and I loved it.  I started listening to it on my ipod and it really became one of my favorite songs and I still play it.  I was in the car listening to it and I decided to look for a song by Toni Braxton.  I saw it on iTunes and when I clicked it, I realized that it was "Veni, Vidi, Vici".  I was shocked because the music sounded nothing like the radio and I was wondering what is was.  I just clicked the link to listen to it and it was the same song but the same version but I was amazed!  This song was exactly what I needed to relax.  I played it on my ipod and I have played it on my radio since then.  It helped me relax and I still listen to it.  I really like this song.  There is just something about it that really makes me feel calm and relaxed and it helps me to feel happy.  The lyrics to this song are just great and the music is beautiful and soothing.  I love this song.

Amazon review: I love the English version of this song.  The song is so beautiful and melodious that it's almost a lullaby.  The song is about a lady who is a good friend of a man who she loves very much.  The lady has a dream of having a child with the man who is in love with her but the lady is not free to have a child with him because she is single.  When the man finds out she is not free then he gives her a ring which she wears to symbolize their love.  The man then takes her to his home and he has his mother, his brother and his family there as his witnesses.  The lady is told by the man not to speak to anyone when she goes to the kitchen to cut the bread and when she returns she is told not to speak to anyone.  Then the man, the man who she loves, tells her to stay in the kitchen and he will speak to her when he comes out to the kitchen.  This happens several times.  The man is not happy about this.  The man is a very hard worker so he is never satisfied.  The man is always thinking of what he could do to make the lady happy.  The man is tired of the lady not speaking to him.  The man is tired of the lady not giving him the respect that he is asking for.  He is tired of the lady not fulfilling his needs.  The man is tired of the lady not caring about anyone but herself.  Finally, the man tells the lady that he wants the lady to take off the ring and he wants the lady to give him her heart.  The lady agrees but the man wants her to remove all of her jewelry.  When the man removes the ring from the lady's hand, he takes the ring and puts it in the ring box.  The man then takes the ring box and puts it under his pillow.  The lady goes to the kitchen to cut the bread.  The lady comes back into the kitchen and goes to the kitchen sink to wash her hands.  The man comes out of the kitchen to the kitchen sink to wash his hands.  This happens several times.  Finally, the man tells the lady to stay in the kitchen and he will speak to her when he comes back out.  This happens several times.  Again, the man is not happy about this.  Eventually, the man tells the lady to stay in the kitchen and he will tell her when he comes back out.  This happens several times.  Finally, the man tells the woman not to speak to anyone when she goes to the kitchen to cut the bakket.  When she returns, he tells her not to speak to anyone.  This happens several times.  Again, the man is not satisfied with this.  He is tired of the lady not speaking to him.  He is tired of the lady not giving him the respect that he is asking.  He is tired of the lady not fulfilling his needs.  He is tired of the lady not caring about anyone but herself.  In the end, he tells the lady to

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: The product is an awesome MP3/iTunes purchase.  I have enjoyed all the albums by Demi Lavato except for the one I received.  I purchased the album called "Wasted" and received "Demi Lavato's Wasted", the product that I received was the one that said "Demi Lavato's Wasted".  I would not have bought this album if I had known that all I would get is the "Demi Lavato's Wasted" product.  It is very disappointing to receive the product that you did not order.  It is very disappointing that someone would not spend the time to write down the name of the artist in the description so that they could get the exact product that they ordered.  It is a little disapointing when you receive something that you have purchased and they decide to make a product out of it.  I hope that I am not the only one who has this problem.  I am just glad that I am not the only one who has experienced it.  If you have the same problem or have any problems with your order, please contact me ASAP.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Demi Lavato since she was first signed to Capitol Records in the late 80's or early 90's.  The music of this band is very impressive and I love to listen to their albums.  When I found out that there were no MP3 downloads of Demi Lavato's albums, I was very disappointed and was not sure if I would ever buy their music again.  After finding out about this site, I was very surprised to find out about this great MP3 service.  I have been listening to Demi's music for years but I have not had the opportunity to buy an MP3 of her music.  Now I have the opportunity to buy and download her music for my iPod.  I am very excited to purchase her music.  The quality of her music is very impressive and I can't wait to listen to it on my iPod.  This is my first time purchasing an MP3.  I am not a big fan of MP3 players that I have ever tried.  I am very excited to try this product.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

They are all only available via an email subscription.  I'm a sucker like that.  I have purchased other beats from them before but they don't have much beat selection.  I guess this beats company is taking a page out of the book of the "Beat Junkies" and is trying to cash in on the old school feel.  It was worth giving it a shot because the beats are so good.  But my guess is it's not going to be a repeat customer.

I was very happy to see him release an entire cd of his older songs, not just a few tracks from his early years.  I was really hoping this cd would be the same.  I was really hoping that he would bring back the music from the album "Gone" which was so great.  To me it was one of his best works.  I was really hoping they would bring back some of the other great songs he did.  They were not.  I just don't understand why they don't have any of his albums from the past.  I have checked out other sites and they don't have any of his older stuff.  What is with that?

Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.

The Newsboys - Live from The Spectrum, Toronto, ON, January 27, 1983 [DVD]

This DVD is a collection of the Newsboys Live from Toronto, Canada in 1983, including all new footage as well as the previously released 1983 concert.

The Newsboys are one of my favorite bands of all time.  I didn't know that they were going to release another live album, and I didn't even know that they were going to release a DVD.  I didn't know that they were going to put it out on DVD until way after the fact.  I had a lot of time to wait on this before I could pick it up.  (I have to say that I was extremely disappointed in it.)  I watched all of the shows live, and most of the songs were new to me, but that's what I wanted.  I watched them all, and I thought they were the best live performances I had ever seen.  The highlights are "It's Alright (for Lazarus)" and "God Must Be a Jerk."  I also thought "You'll Never Go Home" was pretty good, although I'm not sure I was listening to the lyrics.  I would still like to hear more from the band, and I thought "Backyard" was really good.  I would have liked to have heard more of the old songs like "The Big Hurt," but I guess that's what the concert was all about.  I did like the songs "Candy Man" and "I've Got Your Number."

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

I have heard most of their albums and they are just terrific. What I have not heard is the song "So What", but from what I'm hearing, it is just as good as the other songs on this album. I have really enjoyed the songs on this album. I have never heard any of the other songs on this album.

So many of the songs make you feel like you are the one who is going through all the pain on your way to the other side of the world. She is a brilliant vocalist and one of the most talented artists I have ever heard. When I first heard this album I felt like it was going to be a waste of money. I felt like it would be a waste to spend so much money on an album that was going to be a complete waste of money. I was wrong. I'm not the only one who feels this way.

I was singing along to the song and I didn't realize that I was singing along to a song that was about a guy who was about to go off to college. Then the next day when my husband and I were driving I said to him, "I know that song". He said, "I don't know, I guess I could have heard it on the radio". I said, "Well, I don't know either. I think it is probably on the radio somewhere". He said, "Well, I guess we should listen to it". That is when we realized that this song was about a guy who was about to go off to college. I immediately fell in love with the song and I haven't stopped singing it since. The song "We All Have to Die" is such a powerful song for anyone who is going through tough times. The song "When I Fall In Love" shows that Cher is now in a completely different place emotionally than she was

Amazon review: I just wanted to try this song, but I'm pretty sure I already bought it.  I was looking at all these great songs and thought this would be a good one to start with.  But it wasn't from the same album.  I guess it's the same album from the previous song.  I don't know.  I'm just glad I saved up my money to go buy that album!  It's good but it needs more songs like this one.  So glad I saved up for this song.  I liked it!  I've heard this song before, but not really.  It was so fun to listen to.  I love it!  When I saw that it was a song from the movie "Practical Magic," I thought this was the song.  It's so cute!  Wow.  I really like it.  It's nice to know I'm not the only one who thought this was from the movie.  I heard this song before on a commercial for this movie.  I like it.  I love it!  I'm glad I bought it from Amazon.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This cd is a re-release of the band's first CD, Desperate Measures.  I wanted to like this CD but in the end didn't.  There's nothing on this disc you haven't heard before.  It's a bunch of the same tunes over and over.  But after listening to this I think I'll be able to find some other band's music to listen to after my current project.  And that project is still not completed yet.  I may end up giving the CD to a friend who is into rap metal.  But for right now I'm waiting to get my hands on a copy of this.  I'll probably have to wait until I have a complete project.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the band.  I've been a fan since the first Desperate Measures and I love their music.

I was looking for a hip hop/rap CD and this CD fit my criteria.

Amazon review: This is one of the most underrated metal albums ever made.  It's a little hard to put your finger on exactly why but the music on this CD is just great.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band for a while now.  I wanted to like this CD but I just didn't.  The fact that it's just one song per album is the downfall for me as a fan.

Amazon review: I want to like this CD but there are just so many bad reviews on it.  I think they were probably from people who didn't like it.  Just a bunch of negative reviews.  This is one of the best Metal CDs I've heard.  It's the first time I've heard a CD that's so pure and so full of energy.  The songs are great to listen to and the music is so great to listen to.  One song in particular has been stuck in my head and I just love this one song.  It's a song called "The Blackout."  I just love this song.  The music on the cd is just so good.  The production on this CD is just so great.  All of the songs on this CD have a great production on them and just have a great sound to them.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Metal.  The only bad thing about this CD is it just doesn't have good reviews.  It's a great CD, however, but I just don't think it's that good.

Amazon review: I have been a big fan of this band since I first heard them on the radio in the 70's.  After so many years, I am shocked at how badly the band is represented on CD.  The one good song on a CD with 20-30 songs is so insignificant in this context.  Please don't make a CD with 20-30 songs, it's not necessary.  If you could get all the songs included on the CD, instead of just the good songs, that would be fantastic.  I don't want to buy any more of their CDs, I don't care if it's only a CD.  I just want them to put out a 2 CD set with all the songs represented.

They have done a decent job rearranging songs from earlier CD's.  But, they have done a horrible job making a CD.  They put out a bunch of other CDs that they can't make a CD out of.  I'm not kidding, they can't make a CD out of two or three songs on their CDs.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

The Beatles: The White Album (Capitol Records) – This is my all time favorite Beatles album. Great, great, great Beatles album.

This album was released on July 1, 1964.

“A Day in the Life” was the first single. It was released by the Beatles and was a big hit in early 1964. It reached No. 3 on the UK singles charts, No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts, No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and No. 1 on the Cash Box Top 100 chart.

The Beatles’ “Paperback Writer” was the next single, released on August 6, 1964. It reached No. 2 on the UK singles charts and No. 1 on the U.S. singles charts, No. 2 on Billboard’s

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
