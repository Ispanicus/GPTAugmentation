Amazon review: The music itself is great, but the lyrics are so bad it's not worth listening to.  The lyrics are full of obscenities and references to bodily functions of women.  The band's name is a pun on "carnival music" which is a complete oxymoron.  It's like they think that everything is a joke and everything is funny.  This band is nothing more than a joke, and a very bad one at that.
Sentiment: Negative

This album is not bad by any means.  It has some good songs and a few bad ones.  The band is not as bad as most people say.  The songs that are not bad are not bad because of the lyrics.  They are the songs in which the lyrics are the best part of the songs.

One of the best albums out there.  I have found that the songs on this album have a certain groove to them.  I also like the way that some songs have different lyrics for different verses.

I'm not a huge fan of Danzig and I like some of the songs on this album but I don't really like the band.  Some of the songs are just not that good and in my opinion the lyrics are not that good either.  There are other songs though that I like and I think they are better than some of the songs on this album.  I don't really like the lyrics on this album.  The band sounds good though and they have a good groove to them.

This is a great album - great songs and great playing.  If you liked the music in the first 3 albums, you will love this one.  If you liked the music in the second album, you will like this one.  If you liked the music in the third album and I was a fan of the first two, you will like this one.

Overall, this is a solid album.  At it's core, it is a fun and good album.  I don't really like the songs.  I don't like anything on the album.  I don't like the playing.  I don't like the sound.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't like all the songs.  I don't like the band.  I don't like the album.  I don't like the band's name.  And I don't like the album's cover.  I don't like the album's name.  And I don't like the album's cover.

Overall, this album is a waste of time and money.  It is not worth your time and money.

I have to say, this is a good album.  I am a fan of Danzig and I am a fan of the music of the band.  I really enjoy the music.  But this album is not really that good.  The album has some good songs, but the songs on the album are not really that good.  Some songs on the album are great, but most of the songs are not that good.  Some songs on the album are terrible and most of the songs are not that good at all.  The band sounds good though.  The band sounds good, but the songs on the album are not that great.  Most of the songs on this album are average to bad.  The album is not that great. 

Overall, I would give this album a four out of ten.  I have to say, this is a good album.  I am a big fan of Danzig and I really enjoy the music.  I really enjoy the music and the music really makes me happy.  But this album is not really that great.  The songs on the album are average and not that great.

I have to say, this album is a good album.  It is not great.  It is not that good.  It is not horrible.  It is just okay.  I have to say, this album is a good album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my mom and she LOVED it.  She listened to it and played it for my dad.  That's when I realized it wasn't just for the young ones but for anyone.  I thought it was good, but I got a lot of songs from Amazon that I just didn't like.  I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with this CD, but it was a win for me.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to the whole CD as I have been working on my own CD which is being recorded now.  So far I am impressed.    The choir is amazing, I really enjoy listening to them.    The music is beautiful,   I am just amazed that the boys can sing and improvise like they do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the fact that the guys are not afraid to reach for the highest notes.  I also like how they use the high notes and low notes to add to the music.  The high notes are not just the highest notes,  the high notes actually add to the music.  The boys use a lot of high notes in their music in a way that is very impressive and I appreciate that.    And the low notes are not just the lowest notes,  the lowest notes are actually used to add to the music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really enjoyed listening to all of the songs on this CD.  I really enjoyed the way the song 'Let The Worshipers Arise' was sung.  It was a very inspiring way to worship.    I was impressed with the way the boys used the piano.  I've never heard piano used as much as they did.  They used a lot of different keys,   I really enjoyed hearing the different notes and how they used them.    The songs on the CD were amazing,    I would like to see more singing and playing on this CD.

Amazon review: This CD was great.  I love the gospel songs, the songs that tell you to follow God and the songs that tell you to live your life.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: If you are a fan of the music then you should check out 'Blues for the Dead'  A great CD  that is great for the fan.  It is also a great gift.  The band is amazing and the music is great.  It may take a few listens to get to the end of the CD, but once you do then you will be in love.  The lyrics are really funny too and add to the humor of the songs.  There are so many great songs on this CD that will get you dancing.  I love that there are many covers that you can sing along with.  The CD is also great because it has a theme or concept.  Some of the songs are about the band and others are about the fans.  It's a great story and I can't wait to listen to the CD again and again.  The songs are really fun.  They are also easy to sing along with.  It's a great CD.  I'm looking forward to the next CD from them.  I'm excited for the next release.  It's a great CD.  There's no CD in the same style.  It's a great CD.  It's more of a compilation.  It's a great CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The songs on the CD are straight up rockers and the band is very nice.  They are a very good band and I've been a fan of them ever since I first heard them on the radio.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: A couple years ago, I was in a band, and we did a gig at a small club.  There was a young man who was a fan of our band and he came up to me and he asked if he could come up and talk to us.  He said he was going to get a guitar and come up and play.  The band was all really nervous about this.  We were a young band, so we all were a little scared.  The guy came up and he was a really nice young man, and a good looking young man.  And we were in a band that did a lot of covers, so we all looked like our favorite bands.  So he came up and he played some songs for us, and we were all impressed with what he played and what he was singing.  We said that we would be happy to have him come back and play with us.  We said that we would send him home with us and let him play with us.  We said that he would bring the guitar and we would bring the band.  The guy said that he would come back and play with us and we would let him.  Well, we did not write the songs for him.  We did not write the songs for the band.  We wanted to do a cover tune, but it was not the right time, so we did not write the songs.  We did not even bring him to the gig.  We only sent him home.  The guy said, "I will come back and play with you," and we said, "Yes, you will," and he said, "I'll bring the guitar and we will play you back some songs," and we said, "Yes, you will," and he said he would have to take the guitar, and we said, "Yes, you will," and we said, he would have to take his guitar and we would have the band, and he said, "OK, I will take the guitar and we will play some songs," and we said, OK, and we sent him home.  He came back and he played with us and we were happy with what he did.  We did not write the songs for him.  We did not write the song for a cover tune.  We wanted to do a cover tune, but we did not.  We didn't even bring him to the gig.  I don't know what the hell happened, but it was a really nice guy and I really like him.  He is the only one who ever came back and played with us.
