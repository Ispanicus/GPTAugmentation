I love that song "Let Me Sing" it's the first time I've ever heard a song with lyrics from the song rather than just singing the song. The video is very funny and very good.

Amazon review: This is the best album of all time. This album is a must have for every hip hop, soul/R&B, soul/jazz fan. This album is everything that rap music should be. The best rap album I have ever heard. Not only were the tracks great but the album is great. The album has all the old school rap artists and is produced by some of the best. No wonder they make the best rap albums. And the album is hot. There are some songs that are even better than the videos which is to be expected with a live concert recording. The live concert sound is much better than the studio recording. I love this album. I recommend this album to all people that love rap music.

This album reminds me of the 90's, a time when hip-hop was at it's very best. Every song on this album, and the album itself, are great. I have listened to this album 5 times now, and I couldn't put it down! The only thing I didn't like about this album, is the fact that the album only contains 2 good songs. But that's only a minor complaint, so don't let it stand in the way of a great album. -by BOB

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this album was really good.  You get a taste of the first two albums but you don't get the songs that were in between.  The songs have some really good lyrics.  This is on par with the first two albums.  I'm a big rock band fan but this album wasn't as good as the others because of the lack of songs between the two albums.  I think that it would have been great if it had gone back to the first album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard the first 2 albums and liked them, but after a few weeks of listening to this, it's becoming apparent that Korn is no longer the "new" Korn. I didn't care for the band's new material, however, the first two albums have stood the test of time and have been good enough to give them a second shot at the top. I don't think you can say that the new album is a failure, but it is a disappointing album, and I would have given it a 4/5 star rating if it was a straight up Korn collection with no filler. I just don't understand how you can give the band a 2-album contract and have them be so inconsistent.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the third album in a row where I have had to put down the CD after a few minutes.  I have been a Korn fan since 1982, when Korn was one of the first bands to take the "big-band" sound and make it more accessible to the average listener.  I just want to say that this album is much better than the previous two albums, and I have been a Korn fan since 1982.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great sounding album.  I'm only a fan of the first album, but it doesn't hurt that this collection is better.  It has a good mix of songs, and no filler songs.  This is a great sounding collection of Korn songs.  I have enjoyed all of the Korn albums and can honestly say that this is the best of the three.  I am a Korn die-hard, and this record is the best of the three.  I have not met a Korn fan who does not like this CD, so I was very disappointed to hear that they were not going to re-release the first two albums.  I guess they feel that they are good enough for one more album, but in a way, they don't deserve to be a top album like this.  I will be ordering the next Korn album shortly.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the best Korn album of all time.  I have been a Korn fan since 1992, and I have been waiting for this album for a long time.  The band has been on hiatus since 1999, and it's great to hear the band back on the music scene.  This album is absolutely amazing, and it is better than the other Korn albums.  I have bought the other two albums, and I will buy this one in a few months when the price drops.  I am a Korn fan from the beginning, and I am a Korn die-hard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to agree with the previous reviewers on this one.  The album is a little on the short side (there are only 14 songs on the CD) but the instrumentation is excellent with a big band sound.  There is a lot of energy on this CD and it moves along nicely.  This is the first Korn CD I have listened to that had a little more energy than the last two.  The lead vocals are a little weak, but I can live with them.  I had never heard the band's original music before I bought this CD, so in a way, it is like listening to the band's early recordings.  This is the first Korn album I have listened to that I thought was very good, and I am glad I listened to it.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.

Amazon review: I love the song but sometimes it gets too loud. Maybe it's in the mix? I'd have to listen with a bit of a low cut to see if it makes the difference. I also have a hard time with the sound quality. I used my digital audio card and had to turn down the volume to 20%. It's just too quiet. It's fine for watching my movies, but not so great for listening to them.

Amazon review: I was at a concert last night and decided to check out the Killers new album. I have to say that I am very impressed with this album. It's not the "same old thing" that people seem to think it is. It has a very different sound and this is very evident on this album.

Amazon review: I love this song so much! I think it's one of the best songs ever. I've loved it since I was a little kid and my mom has been trying to play it for me for years now. I love the way he sings it and the way he plays the guitar. I think that just because of this song there's people that believe that he was more popular in the 80's. That's just not true. This is a great song and I love that it's on here. I'm really happy with this album and I hope that the next one is as good as this one is.

Amazon review: This song has a little bit of a Latin vibe to it. The guitar solo is awesome, but really it's the bass that makes this song. The bass that comes later on in the song really is powerful.  The bass really makes the song come alive and I love the riffs that are played throughout the song. It's a great song and I hope that the next Killers album is just as good as this one is.  This is a great album and I hope that the next one will be just as good as this one is.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: A classic but at $20, it might be hard to justify. But if you can afford it, you should buy this one.

You have a little more flexibility in your selections or in your choice of which tunes you want to listen to.

I was very impressed with the musicianship and the songs. I decided to buy the "Wailers" album. I bought it the day after Christmas in 1965. I didn't think Bob Marley and the Wailers was any good, but I was so disappointed. I had bought the "Wailers" album from my local shop and heard the songs on the radio. I bought the "Wailers" album in the same town, so I got the "Wailers" album, and so on. I really had no idea what I was getting into. I bought a lot of Bob Marley and the Wailers albums, but the "Wailers" album was the only one I ever really really loved. I can't listen to his "Redemption Song" anymore. It just doesn't have the same impact on me.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is not an album I would recommend to someone who wanted to be able to listen to a good jazz album in their car without having to pause the CD for a break.

Amazon review: One of the first records I bought on CD was a compilation of songs from the movie "The Manchurian Candidate," featuring such great jazz musicians as Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and Eubie Blake. I enjoyed the first three discs - they were fine to listen to, but the last one was a dud - it featured one of the most boring jazz singers I have ever heard. I thought some of the songs were too simple or too boring, not just jazz, but songs that would have been great hits if they were set to jazz standards. "Why Shouldn't I" was a great song, but I thought it was just too bland and un-funny. I would have preferred to have heard "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" and "If You Knew Susie". These songs could have been great jazz standards instead of being un-funny, but they were un-funny.

For jazz music in general I really like the music on this album, but for jazz singers I just don't get it. I will check out "The Complete Doodler" but I think I will not find my favorite jazz singer on this album.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I like her music a lot.  She has recorded some songs that I have enjoyed, but I have not heard many songs from her yet.  I have to credit her with the song "if I had the world" from this CD.  She would not need to go through all the trials and tribulations and struggle that she did to get where she is, but she is a real songwriter and a great lady.  I think she is going to have a hit song on this CD.

I think that it would be better to have a recording of a song by her mother with her at her home singing it.  I had never heard "I am the one who you love" and I loved it.  I love all of her songs.  This CD is a great buy for anyone who loves music.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I will admit that I didn't like this album, but I didn't like the record company either.  They didn't have a clue.  You can't change the songs.

Amazon review: I will admit to hating this album.  I didn't have a lot of time to listen to it, but I have to say that the vocals on "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" and "You Can't Do That" are the best I've ever heard.  They're not bad.  They're just not my favorite.  The rest of the songs are ok, but nothing special.  I'll be buying it again, because I really like the rest of the songs.  The only thing I don't like about the album is the fact that I had to listen to the title track over and over again for the rest of the night.  It was the only song I heard that day that I didn't like.  I hope they release another album, because they're not as bad as this one.

I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me.  I don't want to hate on people, but I don't believe this is a good song.  I've heard better songs.  I don't want to be like that.  This is just... I just don't like this song.  I want more from this band.  I've heard their best songs, and this one is just... I just don't like this song.  I'll be buying the next album.  I'm a huge fan of country music, and I really like this band.  This album is the best I've heard, so I'll buy it.  But I just don't like it.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

My favorite song is called "If you want to be with me, you better think twice" It's by Billy Currington. I also like "You are beautiful" by R. Kelly.

When you go to the store, you always hear this song. I think you should have a Billy Currington CD. It's my favorite.

I like this song because it's not the typical love song. It's more like a confession song. It's not preachy, it's not a "don't mess with me" song. It's not a "you should change" song. It's a song about love and it's about someone that's in love with someone else and wants to confess that he or she loves the other person. It talks about what it's like to be in love and what it's like to confess. And it's a great song.

I really like this song because it's not the typical love song. It's a song about what it's like to be in love. It's not preachy, it's not a "don't change" song, it's not a "you should change" song. It's a song that tells the story of what it's like to be in love.

I really like this song because it's not the typical "I love you" song. It's more like a confession song. It's not a "you should change" song, it's not a "don't mess with me" song. I like the message this song has. I love that this song talks about how you can't change someone. You can't change somebody. It's a song that talks about how you can't change somebody. And you can't have a heart that's bigger than their heart. You can't change that. You can't have a heart that's bigger than your heart. You can't change somebody. You can't have a heart that's bigger than your heart.

This song is one of my favorite songs. It's very deep, very interesting. I can relate to the lyrics. I think Billy Currington is a great artist, I think he's one of the top artists in the world.

I was listening to this song on my ipod when I got home from work. I was listening when I got home from work and it was just so loud. It was on repeat. I was listening to this song all day. It was on repeat and just to top it off, I had a message on my ipod where I was supposed to call someone. I was listening to this song all day. I had been listening to this song all day. I had been listening to this song and I had a message on my ipod for somebody. I can't wait until I get a chance to listen to this song on my ipod again.

This song is not the typical "I love you" song. It's a song about what it's like to be in a relationship. It's not "goodbye, goodbye" song, it's not a "no, no" song. It

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: One of my favorite songs ever.  I used to like this song when it was on the radio, but now I can't stand it.  It's been a while since I've heard it and I'm sure it's been lost in the shuffle.  I guess I'll just have to keep the song on my computer and listen to it from time to time.

Amazon review: I bought this song for my birthday and was very surprised to hear that it was one of the very first songs I ever purchased.  I love the song and I love Michael's voice.  It's a shame that it wasn't included with the other songs on this CD, but I hope it becomes part of a new and very special release.

Amazon review: The worst song ever.  Too bad it's so short.  I bought the CD thinking it would be a good addition to my collection.  It did not live up to my expectations.

Amazon review: I bought the song on the recommendation of my friend.  First of all, I love Michael's voice and this is one of my very favorites.  I have had trouble getting it to play on my computer.  I tried going through the software on my computer and I tried various CD-RW drives.  It would not play.  It was only on my computer for a few seconds before the program crashed on me.  This made me feel like I wasted my money.  I'm sorry, but this is a terrible song.  I didn't think it was that bad, but this is how it sounded.  I'm sure it will be fine when I get a better computer.  I'm disappointed in the whole thing.  I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: This is the first song I ever purchased on Amazon.  I had no idea they still had it.  I thought it was a terrible song.  I had no idea what I was looking at when I was listening to it.  I was amazed when the song started playing.  I had no idea what the song was about.  I listened to it several times and I became very interested in it.  I listened to it again and again until I finally figured out what it was about.  I am so impressed with the song.  I love the song.  I love Michael's voice.  I love the song.  It's a great song.

Amazon review: I was looking for a song to listen to while I was driving to work.  Since the song was so short, I was hoping it would be on the CD.  I was pretty disappointed when I opened the box and saw that it only had 2 songs.  I was even more disappointed when I found out that the CD only had one song.  I didn't know what to do.  I was going to throw the CD in the garbage.  I ended up buying it.  I love it.  I love the song.  I love the voice of Michael.  I love the song.  I love the song.  I love the song.  The song is terrible.  It's so short.  I bought it because I thought it was a great song.  I bought it because I am a Michael fan.  I love Michael.  I love this song.  I love the song.  I love Michael.  I love the song.  I love the song.

Amazon review: The song was playing on my ipod when I was in the shower this morning.  I immediately turned it down and it was gone.  I looked for it last night on my computer and it was nowhere to be found.  It was the perfect song to take to a friend's house and play on the jukebox.  I'm so disappointed.  I've purchased many CD's and have always gotten exactly what I wanted.  This is the first CD I have ever returned.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.
