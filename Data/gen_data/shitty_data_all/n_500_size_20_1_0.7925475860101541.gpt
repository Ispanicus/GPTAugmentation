Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.

I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I have not given a review for this album yet, but here is a review for the album "From the Beginning" by David Lang. Lang is a very well known author (author of "The New Holy Grail") and has produced albums for a lot of very well known artists. He has also written music for a lot of movies and has also been in a few TV shows. His music is very ambient, and very very well done. This is just my opinion, but I really believe that he is a very good composer.

This is his 2nd CD and it's very good. You may want to buy it if you like his work.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I was extremely disappointed the first time I heard this album.  I thought it was just average, but then I listened again and I realized that I was just being picky.  It is my least favorite out of the 3 of the albums I have.  The songs just don't do anything for me.  I like the first two best and the last two are not that bad.  I don't understand why they have such a high price on the album.  The first two are amazing because they have a unique sound.  The last two are just average.  A lot of people will buy this album just to get the first two.  I would not recommend it.  I have been listening to this album for about a year now and I still haven't been able to get into it.  It is just not my thing.  I don't know if it is because I am not a fan of the singer or the band, but I just don't like it.  It is just a bad album.

Amazon review: I am not sure if my review will be enough to help this artist get on the right path.  I can tell you that I was a huge fan of the band before they broke up.  After they broke up I started to take it as a slight insult because I liked the band so much.  Now I have to admit that I am not the biggest fan anymore.  The band is just kind of boring to me.  I can't imagine it would be a big hit.  I really hope they do better in the future.  They have a lot of potential.  They have a new album coming out in a month.  I hope it is a great one.

Amazon review: I saw him in concert last night, and he is soooooo talented! He is so much fun and he is very emotional. I love the way he is singing, he has a great voice.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I heard this all the time.  It's not a bad album, but it's not great either.  There's not much to it.  Like I said, I've heard it a few times, but it never stood out.  They're not bad records, but they never really blew me away.

Amazon review: I liked a lot of this album, but I don't know if I would call it a masterpiece.  It has a lot of good sounds on it, but there's not a lot to them. And I don't know if I would say it's a great album or not.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  The only good thing about this album is that they've taken the worst parts of a lot of other albums and stuck them into this one.  I don't know if I'd go that far.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The guy who writes songs for other artists sounds like he has to write songs for his own band too. It's not a bad album, just kind of a disappointing one. He's got a great voice, but I don't see him being able to write the kind of songs that are required for a live show.

Amazon review:  Jackie is definitely the best of the three.  She is a natural.  I like how she is different from the other two.  I'd have to say her voice is the best.

My only complaint is that she is so beautiful and sweet that she could have a perfect voice.  Her voice is very high which I love.  She has a really great voice.  She is just perfect.  The music is very good and I love the mandolin.  I find that she can play the piano and guitar very well.  She is the clear winner.  She is definitely my favorite.  I like her voice the best.
