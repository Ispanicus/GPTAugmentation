Amazon review: And lyrics that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyrics of Belfast, Bernie Taupin sure can paint a picture wit words.  Can't wait for the album.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around The Starting Line came. they sound exactly like NFG. which isn't good either. and there lyrics are so boring and lame. if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyrics and not to great of music then this is the cd for u

Amazon review: The "Pitchfork" review was a great read, but also very well-sourced and well-written.  I'm in the middle of a hard-drive purge, so you have to forgive my lack of a review until I can find time to do one.  This CD is not a bad album, but it's a very average album.  With the exception of maybe the "Weird Al" reference, most of the songs are fairly standard punk-influenced rock & roll, with a few standout moments for me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've got a hard drive going full speed on The Starting Line, so I can't really comment on the album in detail.  I will say that this is a good-sounding CD, but I'd have really liked to hear more vocals on the songs.  I think the one song where the vocals come in well is the closing song, "It's Not Personal" which is great.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: They sound like a bunch of kids who've been playing in a basement band for five years.  I like songs that sound like they've been on a long time, and I like the music of The Starting Line.  Most of the songs are simple, but some are good.  I love the band's name, they're good, and I hope to hear more from the band.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to The Starting Line by "The Fannies" on the cover of their album.  They had a good album and I got the CD.  This was a good album.  They have a bunch of songs that I like and they're not as repetitive as some bands I've heard.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I have not been able to find this book anywhere because this is a true story of a girl's life and she has passed away. It is a very beautiful and inspiring story about a girl who was very talented and had a hard life. It is her story. The music is amazing as well. I love the book and I am sorry to say that I have just purchased the CD version. The CD is very nice and sounds nice. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves books and music.

Amazon review: I found this book in a book store and thought it would be a nice present for someone special. It was a very nice surprise until I read the book and found out it was written by a woman who had sex with a man, and had sex with a lot of men over the years. I was very angry and did not want to lose the gift. I bought it anyway, and then discovered the book was about a woman who was raped and abused by a man who used drugs and alcohol to seduce her. I was so glad I did not lose the book. I have read a few books since than and I am still buying books from bookstores, so I could not wait to buy this one. The music is very good, I like it. It is very similar to the music from Van McCoy's album.

Amazon review: I was very surprised that this book was on CD. I have read the lyrics to this song before, but I did not know that the music was included in the book.

I have not met Mark, but he is a very nice man. I would highly recommend this to anyone.

This is a beautiful and very well recorded recording of the Sousa March.

Excellent sound quality.

The only problem is that it's all the same tune, but the arrangement and playing is very different and the players have different tacks.

They should have played it in a variety of orders to sound like different tunes, and have played the tune in a different order than was originally in the piece, and for that matter, should have played it in the style of the composer, or the piece was written in the style of the composer, for the music to fit well with the music.

The only problem with the recording is that the sound quality is not very good.

The other two recordings of the same piece are just as good.

The other problem is that the Sousa March is very difficult to play. I have listened to all three of them many times. I have never heard anyone play it that well.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the musical Hair.  However, I have never been able to find this particular album, so I have decided to download the soundtrack album on which this album is based off.  I listened to the album on its own and did not really enjoy it.  However, when I listened to it with the entire soundtrack album, I did.  It is a great soundtrack to a great album.  The songs are upbeat and have a great sound to them.  The songs are not as upbeat as the album, but they are still good.  They have a great feel to them that makes them feel like the real thing (to me).  The songs are all original (not re-workings) and are all very different.  The album was written by a few different artists from the 70s and 80s (all different genres).  I know that one of the reasons I like this album so much is because of the different songs that it has.  I also like the fact that I am able to listen to it alone without the whole album, and that the songs are all different to the original.  I hope to check out the movie too, but I want to just listen to the soundtrack album.  I have been listening to it all day, and it is amazing - so happy I have found it.  I know I am a little bias, but I think it is a great album!

Amazon review: My first purchase was from this record store in San Francisco.  I had not heard of it and I was a little hesitant to buy, but I was so excited that it was a first.  I did not know the name, but I knew the music.  I listened to this album for hours.  I think it takes about 3 or 4 listens to really get what this album is about.  I will say that most of the songs are happy.  The songs like "There is a Light" will make you smile.  The song "Ain't No Cure" is a really sweet song.  Overall, it is a good album and worth a listen.

Amazon review: I bought this album at a local record shop.  I was drawn to the cover, but I was not really sure what I was hearing.  I liked it, but was not sure it was worth the $30 that I had to spend.  I was not pleased with the sound.  I was hoping that the sound was better and that the song selection was better.  I was not happy with this mix.  I went to another record store and returned it.  I was hoping that the second store would not return it.  It was returned to me that same day.  I was not happy.  I was not happy with this mix.  I ended up buying the album on Amazon from a different record store.  I was not happy with the mix.  I was not happy with the sound.  The songs were not what I expected.  They were more like r&b.  The whole first song had a bad sound to it and then the entire second song had a bad sound to it.  I was very disappointed.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is just plain horrible, very bad production, very repetitive, very boring.  You have to think of this song as "The Geezer" from "The Three Stooges"  With a little bit of a "t" and even a "k" there for you to make it singable.  It's as if this song was recorded by a little girl in kindergarten who was asked if she would sing a song about her dog named "Geezer".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In a song titled "I Want to Be With You" is one of the worst, most boring tracks I have ever heard.  The production is very low-key and there is no emotion with the voice at all.  All that is left is a lifeless, monotone sound.  The only good thing is the fact that it is sung by the lovely, extremely talented Mariah Carey.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song may be the worst thing to ever appear on the radio.  It is just absolutely atrocious.  This song is awful.  I don't care what Mariah says about her voice at all.  I don't care if she sings from the heart; this song is just so flat and boring.  I really don't know what to say.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very "fun" song, but it's not really a "fun" song.  It is nothing more than a song written by a woman and sung by a man.  The only reason this song is on here is because it has the word "fun" in it, which is the only positive thing in the entire song.  When Mariah sings, "I was having fun, but you know I can't have any fun now," she is actually being very honest.  She is actually having fun.  That is why she is trying to make us feel bad for her because we don't give her any credit for her fun.  If she is having fun, she should be able to sing about it without having to go through her "problem" song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a collection of different styles of Mariah Carey singing about different things.  All in all, it is a very disjointed collection of songs that are not very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is okay, but it doesn't really get any better.  It's really just like any other song from Mariah Carey.  I can only hope that a better album is released next year.  But for now, this song is only good enough to be annoying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I believe this song is about cheating or something, but it doesn't seem to be that way.  I don't know, I just don't believe it.  There are many people who claim that this song is about cheating and that Mariah is cheating on her husband and singing about it.  I don't know, I don't believe it.  I just don't believe that this song was ever about anything more than a bunch of different styles of music, all of which are very boring and lame.  It's just some old song that was recorded a long time ago that was given a new life.  The only reason it is here is because of the fact that it has the word "fun" in it.  The only thing that is fun about it is the fact that it is Mariah Carey singing about her husband cheating on her.  She sounds like she is really sad about it.  I don't know what to think.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the worst, most boring song to ever be on the radio.  It's just so boring and boring.  If Mariah says that she is having fun, then that's what she is having.  She should be able to have fun without having to sing about it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song's title is "You're the Reason" and it's about the fact that you are the reason that you're not happy.  I don't know what to think about it, but I found it pretty good, especially the part about how you can't sing about everything that you're not happy about.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song was written by the legendary Nat King Cole.  He wrote most of his songs, and he was a very humble man.  This was the first song that he ever wrote that he didn't use his own voice and it still is one of his best songs.  I think it is one of the best songs ever.  I remember hearing it in a bar and I got

Amazon review: I am a little surprised at how few people agree with my opinion of this song. It's not the most beautiful tune in the world, but it's definitely an excellent song in my opinion. The only flaw I can find is that the song doesn't have enough instrumentals in the background. If they would have added more instrumentals, I think it would have given a better overall feel to the song.

Amazon review: I don't like this song because it starts out with a really bad guitar solo and then goes into a song that really does not have much to it. The song just doesn't really have much to it.

Amazon review: I don't like this song - the guitar solo is just too much. I also would prefer that you didn't use the word "tired" in the song title. I feel that this song is meant to be a positive song, and I think you should have taken it that way, by not using the word "tired".

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first of a series of songs by the band and they are all excellent.  The songs are "The Best of All..." and "Best of All", which are each a collection of songs taken from their past albums.  It's definitely a great series of songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this song, I can't understand why it is on the album I just purchased, and I didn't listen to it on the entire CD.

I thought the song was pretty good, but, like others, I didn't really feel it was worth the purchase of the entire CD.

I'm looking for it, and I'm not finding it anywhere.  I was looking at the entire compilation of songs on this page, and this song was not on it.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: The album has a very raw, unpolished sound that is not to everyone's taste and a little on the fast side.  There are some great tracks, but there is a definite lack of polish in this CD.

Amazon review: I really like the way this CD sounds. This is heavy metal at its most raw. If you like the raw, heavy sound then this is for you.  The only thing that bugs me about this CD is that it sounds like the band just recorded a cover of "Ride the Wild Surf" and then added the instrumentals.  It sounds like they used a drum machine for the drums and recorded the bass and guitar parts.  The only problem with that is that the drummer sounds like he is trying to keep up with the bass player.  The bassist also sounds like he is trying to keep up with the drummer.  It's a very good recording.  The only bad thing I can say is that I wish that the band would be more honest with the sound.  I don't think that they are trying to be a punk band with a heavy metal edge.  I don't mind heavy metal, but this band just sounds like they are trying to be another hard rock band and can't come up with a sound that is unique enough to stand out from the rest.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this cd. The only thing I don't like about it is the way the lead vocal is sung. I don't know if the vocals are supposed to be a little higher on the vocals or if it was just an accident. The guitars are really well done. The drums are really good. The bass and the keyboard parts are good. I would like to see some more songs on this cd. There are a few songs that have great guitar solos or a better lead guitar playing. The only thing that makes the sound of this cd a little different is the keyboards. The keyboard solos are really good and add to the feeling of the cd. The album is really good if you like raw and heavy metal.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: This song's a big favorite of mine.  I've been listening to it for hours.  The sound quality seems like a little bit better than the original album, but no less quality.  Overall, I think it's still a good, fun and catchy song.  I definitely would buy it again, and recommend it to others.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to this song during my college years in the 80's.  I was at a friend's house and this was playing in the background.  I immediately fell in love with this song.  That night I went to a party where this song was playing, and all the girls started dancing to it.  I was pretty impressed with my first impression.  I never heard it on the radio until college, and the band that played it was just a cover band.  But I am glad that I finally had a positive reaction to this song.  I can't wait to listen to the original version.

Amazon review: This is a fantastic song.  I love it.  It's fun, danceable, and one of the best songs I've heard all year.  I also listen to many different types of music, including reggae and salsa, but I would never consider myself a fan of traditional reggae.  That being said, I absolutely adore this song.  It's a great song for the dance floor, and you really can't go wrong with it.  It's easy to dance to, but the lyrics are really deep and beautiful.

Amazon review: I love the whole album, and the one I have is the original, but I haven't been able to get my hands on the other one yet so I have been listening to the cd the past few weeks.  I bought it online and it came with a cool little bag that had the lyrics that were printed on it.  I have been keeping that in my locker so I can refer to it when I need to know what lyrics to sing next.  I love all of the songs on this album and I can't wait to get my hands on the other one.
