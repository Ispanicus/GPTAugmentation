Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Tribute to the late Axl Rose and the Red Hot Chili Peppers

A tribute to the late Axl Rose
Posted
01/24/2016

I have been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers since the release of "Greatest Hits" back in 1988. I have listened to about 25 different songs by them, and have never been able to get into the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I always liked the old songs better. I recently started listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers again, and I have to say that this album is an exception.

The album starts off with the track "The Devil and God" and has a great beginning. The song is a good representation of the bands sound

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This band is like the Blackberry, they only produce a product of mediocrity.  They are the most boring group I have ever listened to.  From the beginning you are thinking that they are going to be good, but it turns out they are just another band from another group.  The song structure will not allow them to be any more than mediocrity.  They should have quit and released their own album.

Amazon review: I like this band but the songs are terrible.  They need to change their name to something more fitting, like Twiztid 2.0.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst albums ever.  There are a lot of filler tracks and nothing really good.  It's like listening to a bunch of shitty rap songs on an album that isn't even hip hop.  There is no originality or creativity, just one line after the next and some decent rapping that never really gets to the point.  This is one of the worst albums ever.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: A great album that I really liked.  But I will be honest, I was not a fan of this album until I heard the vocals.  I thought they sounded extremely bad at the time.  And now I understand what they were going for with the sound.  I love the concept behind this album, but the lyrics are a big let down.  I mean, I like all of the songs, but I really don't feel like hearing or listening to "I'm On Fire" anymore.  That was the only song that I really liked.  I feel like everything else on this album is terrible.  There is no way it could have been any worse.  The CD has a great cover.  The packaging looks exactly like the CD.  They should have taken the CD out of the shrink wrap and put it in a jewel case or something.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has more than its share of problems.  There are some good songs, such as "Smile", "Piece Of My Heart", and "Deeper" (to name a few), but the majority of the songs are cliched, repetitive, and cheesy.  It's a pity those songs were not enough to save this album from the dumpster.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album starts off with a bang, but it doesn't last long.  The first song is "Smile" and it's catchy, but short.  The second song, "Piece of My Heart" is nice, but not as good as "Smile".  "Deeper" is a perfect pop hit, but it's not a very memorable song.  The CD is nice, but I just wish it was a little longer.  The CD is well-packaged and looks like it should have been on the jewel case a little better.  That's not to say that the CD is not worth the price or that I don't think others would like it as much, but I just wish "Smile" and "Deeper" had been longer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band since the beginning.  I love the sound and the lyrics.  The concept is great.  But, I really don't get why people seem to have such a hate for this band.  This album is not for everyone.  I would suggest to those who are looking for a party album, but are not into the heavier metal sound, listen to this album.  But, as with most albums, not everyone will enjoy this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a fan of many different types of music.  But, I can't say that I like this album.  It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it.  There are good parts (like "Smile", "Piece of My Heart", and "Deeper"), but the bad parts (like everything else on this album) just make it even harder to love this album.  This album should be given to those who really love this type of music.

Amazon review: I am surprised this album has sold as well as it has.  I was hoping that this album would sell more than 1,000 copies.  That would have been quite an achievement.  They really need to stop using that stupid song that is on the cover.  I hope that people don't go out and buy this album just because it has the song "It's Tricky".  I can't understand how people can like this album.  You couldn't possibly like it.

Amazon review: "The third studio album from a band that has been around since the beginning of heavy music. This is pure heavy metal with a heavy metal edge. Songs like "Falling Down" and "The Man" are very heavy and fast, with a lot of guitar solos and great drums. The riffs are very well done and the solos are huge. "The Man" is the most powerful song on the album. The riffs are really heavy as well. As the songs progress, the riffs get more and more complex and get more and more fast and heavy. If you like your music to have a heavy metal feel, this CD is for you. The songs are extremely well written and the vocals are great. There is a lot of energy and passion in this album. Most importantly, this is the ultimate metal album! "

Amazon review: I thought this was a very interesting CD. I like the way you can change the tempo from different songs and listen to them at different speeds. I also like the whole 'tune out' kind of thing. I did not really like the lyrics on this CD, but will have to look into those later. It does not matter to me if you like it or not, but I would like to know why others disliked it. I would also like to know if you can delete songs from the CD so I can stop listening to them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is great, but the lyrics are horrible.  I understand that they were trying to be cool, but this is not hip hop.  Please don't even waste your time with this.  I would have given it five stars only because of the opening track.  If you like this song, put your attention to the lyrics.  I don't care that the music is dope, it has to be the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've bought several of these, and I'd say they are excellent.  They do the job of getting you into the groove, but the lyrics are not strong enough to make it memorable.  I've used these before, and I can always count on them to deliver the goods.  I would, however, say that the songs range from great to pretty good.  They also have a few tracks that are too long and end up sounding like a big fat mess.  Overall, I'd give it three stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is an excellent album!!!  I've been working on my vocals since I was 8 years old.  I've studied with several great teachers.  I've taken several lessons.  I've gone to the gym, and I've worked very hard.  I've had many bad experiences with teachers, and many good, too.  I finally reached a level where I could sing, and I could do so with a big smile on my face.  When I listen to this album, I can honestly say that I am happy.  I am truly proud of what I have been able to accomplish.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a few days and I like it a lot.  Maybe I am spoiled with having bought so many albums that are just great.  Maybe I just need to learn how to listen to a CD.  I thought it was a little long, but I like it.  Some of the lyrics are good, and I like the album overall.  The vocals are a little weak in the beginning, but I like the overall sound of it.  I like the songs and the overall effect that they have on my life.  The songs are on a slow, calm, and relaxing tempo.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Twiztid have a new album out, called "New Beginning" and it is a good album that can be enjoyed by any fan of the band. This is the first time we will see the band on a CD, so it is worth checking out for those who are new to Twiztid and the band. The album is good, but not great. The songs are solid, the production is good, and the musicianship is good. The vocalist on the album is not very good, but I have to admit he does have some good vocals. The sound is good, the music is good, and the lyrics are good.

Amazon review: This album is great! A lot of the songs are very catchy and just fun to listen to, however, the album is not perfect. The songs have a lot of "plop" sounds and some of them have a very tinny sound, which makes them a little odd and out of place. The vocals are not the best, but as stated before, the album is good. The song "All or Nothing" is one of my favorites on the album.

The songs are a good mix of rock, pop, hip hop, and more. Some songs have a slow feel to them and some of them have a faster feel to them. All in all, this is an amazing album!!!

Amazon review: Twizid put out a great album. This is a solid release. The production and song writing are excellent. The album does have a few annoying songs. One of the biggest songs is "All or Nothing", which is very long and would have been shorter if the chorus wasn't repeated several times. I like the album, but I would have liked it to have been longer. It's not a bad album by any means, it's just a "little short" for my tastes.

Amazon review: The band has changed up a bit on their new album with this release, which is a good thing. The first five tracks of "New Beginning" are a little too short and the chorus of the song "New Beginning" is repeated several times. Other than that, the album is great.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I downloaded this because I had heard good things about it, and it was free. I was amazed at how bad this was. I downloaded the entire album, but I don't listen to it. It's just the same old filler. There are 3 songs on here that are good. The first one is the one with the piano, the second one is the one with the guitar, and the third one is the one with the viola. But other than that, the rest of the songs are just all generic and nothing special.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a beautiful, touching, heartfelt, and beautiful album. It is not just a collection of love songs, but it is a collection of love songs, stories, and songs that have nothing to do with love. Each song is a love song to one of the characters in the opera (a "love song" to the opera's main character, an opera lover, or a love song to an opera lover), and all of them are wonderful. I've listened to the CD a number of times, and I have enjoyed it every time.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
