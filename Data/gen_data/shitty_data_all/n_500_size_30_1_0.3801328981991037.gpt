Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: This is what I call a "musical movie trailer" with a title like "Song For The Lonely". The film itself is a little too long and has a lot of music. For the most part, the songs by various artists have a good beat with a good beat on them. The lyrics are often very appropriate to the music that is playing. The music is mostly instrumental, which is cool. The soundtrack features a lot of songs from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, a different style than the bands of today.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.

Amazon review: I've always been a big fan of the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, and have always found their versions of Sinatra's songs to be great.  "The Way We Was" is one of my favorites, and "I've Got To Be Free," was a favorite of mine for many years. I love "You Can't Help But Cry" and "Why Shouldn't I," which were also recorded by them.  In fact, their version of "You Can't Help But Cry" is probably my favorite of all of their songs.  This recording is excellent and was a real pleasure to listen to.

The only thing is when I listen to the album, it just sounds like a collection of old songs with new arrangements.  That's why I think BOC could have done their own album.  They did a great job of recording the songs, it was a pleasure to listen to them.  I'd love to hear them do a complete album of the Ray Sinatra Orchestra.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

It's a love song, so there's some risk involved, but the song was so very beautiful and had some great lyrics, but the song was written with a very high voice that almost made the song sound as if it was done in a choir.

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

This is a true story.

I was on vacation with my family in the Bahamas.

We drove into the city and I went by a store. There were no signs outside, so I went in.

I looked around, but I didn't see any books.

I walked over to the counter and asked the clerk to check the books.

She said, "Oh, we don't have any." And she took the books and walked out of the store.

I said, "Where are the books?"

She said, "I don't know."

I said, "Can you check and tell me if you have any books by yourself?"

She said, "I can't check. I'm not allowed."

I said, "Are you allowed to check the books, or not?"

She said, "I can't check."

I became irritated and I said, "I am not paying for any books here!"

She said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. I don't have any books."

I became upset and I said, "I am not paying for anything here."

She said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. You are not allowed to leave."

I said, "I am not paying for a book or anything."

She said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Smith."

I said, "I am not paying for any books here."

She said, "I know you probably won't, but I can't check because I am not allowed."

I said, "I am not paying for any books, or anything."

She said, "That's right, Mr. Smith. No one is allowed to leave."

I said, "You are not allowed to leave."

She said, "I know you probably won't, and I'm sorry, but I can't check because I'm not allowed."

I was really happy to see this album review.  I didn't think anyone would actually buy the album, but I was really happy that you liked it.  You have to understand that I'm a huge Neil Diamond fan, but I can't say that my opinion of the album is any different from yours.  I'm glad you liked it.  I like the album.  It's a good album and I'll be buying it again, but it seems to be more of the same.  I don't get how it gets a higher review than this.  The album is good, but I still think that it's a long album and has some boring songs.  The album is good, but I hope that it will get better and be better.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy.

Amazon review: What the hell happened to the band?  I remember reading a review where a band told them to go fuck themselves and this band went and did exactly what they said.

Amazon review: A pretty good album. I think that it is a little "too" poppy, but on the other hand, I don't think that they have the talent (or the money) to be able to make an album like this.

Amazon review: This song is like a perfect mix of two different songs. It is a very slow down tempo, and it is very melodic. I like how this song has it's guitar and bass in the background but I don't think that the guitar needs to be played as loud as it is. I like the way that it ends with the vocal, and I like the way they mixed it up into a different song.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of The Beatles. I listen to all of them. I have all of their old albums and I listen to them all the time. I love the songs, and I love the stories. This song has a very different feel than any other song, and it makes it very interesting. I think that there is a lot more talent in the singing, than in the songwriting. There are great things in this song, but they are not always the best things. I think that there is a lot more talent in the singing than in the songwriting.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

I can't imagine giving a negative review without any facts.  I am a very happy customer that has bought hundreds of music that I love.

A:

Sorry to hear about this. I've had this same problem with other songs. If you're happy with the product, you might want to re-download it, but that's it. I've been buying music for my family for years and we've never had an issue.
I can't imagine that buying a CD would have made a difference. It's like I was saying, it's like a song was stuck in your head, it doesn't matter if it's in your iTunes or on a CD.
If you're happy with the purchase, then you may want to consider asking for a refund.
If you're not happy, then you need to do something about it.

  You could try to contact customer support or try to get the song removed from your library.

  You could also consider buying the song from another source.

  You could also ask for a refund through the iTunes Store.

If you don't feel like you're getting a fair deal, then you should consider asking for a refund. There's no reason to feel bad.

  If you don't want to go through the hassle of contacting customer support, you can ask the person who sold you the song to remove it from your library.

  You could also contact Apple and see if they can remove the song from your library.

If all else fails, you could just ask a store that sells CDs. If they don't have it, they could probably be happy to exchange it for you.

If you don't want to tell your family that you're unhappy, you could try to buy the song on a different platform. Your choice.

  You could also consider buying the song on a different platform.

  You could also contact the original artist and ask them to remove the song from your library.

A:

My suggestion is to try and get it removed from the original artists music or music store. They have the legal right to do this. 
The only way to make sure that the music you're purchasing doesn't end up on other peoples' playlists is to make sure you buy it from the original artist.
It's hard to find a decent music store that's big enough to sell physical CDs, but big enough to be able to get a digital copy of the record.
You can try searching for the song on the artist's site, maybe they have a store that sells physical copies in the store.

  You could also do what I did and buy from a different platform. I bought a song off of iTunes.

  You could also try contacting the original artist, maybe they have a store that sells physical copies of the record.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Just received this and all I can say is that I really did not expect much from this.  I think that they may have gone a little over the top with some of the tracks.  It makes sense that Dre would use this genre for his upcoming album since it takes the energy out of the song and makes it more suited for a mixtape.  I think that this is a great move by Dre because it gives him more material to work with.  He definitely has plenty to work with since he has a new album coming out in the next month or so.

Amazon review: I am a true hardcore fan of Ice-T.  I have been listening to his albums for years and years and I have never thought that I would ever give an Ice-T album a shot.  That is until I got this CD for a great price.  This CD is nothing more than a compilation album of Ice T's previous solo albums.  If you are a hardcore Ice-T fan, you will probably like this.  If you are not a hardcore Ice-T fan, or are not a fan of Ice T at all, this will be a waste of your time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really excited to buy this CD.  I thought that this would be a good way to learn about the music of Ice T.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.  Ice T's solo albums were okayish.  They didn't sound as if they were recorded with much thought.  There were no real stand-out tracks to me.  On the other hand, I expected more.  The album was just average.  I would have liked to have seen some more songs that had unique sounds.  I do not like Ice T's album "T.I.M.E." or "T.I.M.E. 2."  I am not a fan of Ice T's music whatsoever and I do not think that it should be my favorite of his solo albums.  I am sure that Ice T and Dre will have plenty of material to work with before they release their next album, I just hope that they don't leave anything on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm glad I decided to get this album.  This CD was the only one to completely satisfy my craving for Ice-T.  Ice-T's music is like a drug.  The first time I heard this CD, it was like I was suddenly falling in love with Ice T.  I listened to it in the car and it gave me more than just a good feeling.  I really did like it.  On the other hand, I thought that the album was a little out of place.  Ice-T is a rapper, and he is supposed to be a stand-up comic.  The album is made to be an album of stand-up comedy.  But instead, Ice-T just raps.  This album is kind of a waste of time.  I would recommend this CD to people who like the music of Ice-T, but don't think that he is a stand-up comedian.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard only good things about this album.  I like the Ice-T album "T.I.M.E." and "T.I.M.E. 2."  It was the only two Ice-T albums that I had heard that sounded like they were recorded with much thought.  I like the sound of the songs on this album.  Also, the CD was a great deal for me.  The album comes with an exclusive Ice-T poster and a bonus track, "A-List."  The poster is a nice feature.  I would recommend this CD to the people who like Ice-T.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD to try to see if I could find a CD album that I hadn't heard yet.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is the first Ice-T CD I have actually heard that I liked.  The first song I listened to was "Ice-T."  I really liked the way that the vocals were performed and it felt like I was sitting in one of his shows.  The only song that was a disappointment to me was "Ice-T."  It was uninteresting and the lyrics and production seemed to be a bit off.

Amazon review: I have always liked Ice-T's music.  I have been watching his stand-up comedy shows since I was a kid.  Ice-T is a funny man and I really enjoy his stand-up.  I think that his albums are just stand-up albums.  I don

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: I would've liked a dj that could have done more with more than just this one piece. It's a very unique sound. I'm pretty sure this dj has some sort of sound design background, and I'd like to see more of this.  I would like to see if I could create a similar sound myself.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think the only thing wrong with this is that I don't even know where to start.  It's not a bad piece of music, but it's very dull and you have to force yourself to pay attention.  It's not like I'm going to be able to dance to this, or sing along.  This is just a very dull piece of music, and I'll probably never buy anything this boring ever again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not even going to bother trying to find some music to download.  I am aware that the album cover says that it's "not exactly pop" but that's only because they were trying to be vague and not give away the actual genre.  I'm disappointed that I wasted my time.  I would have probably been happier if I had bought a few singles instead of the whole album.

Amazon review: It's like the music version of the music game Guitar Hero.  I don't know what else to say, I've downloaded literally thousands of songs from this site over the years with absolutely no luck.  This whole site is a waste of time, and I can't believe they're charging anything for it.  I'd rather pay more for a single song than waste my time with this scam.

Amazon review: the only thing I want to say is that I bought this cd off this site and I liked it.  I don't know what kind of music this is but it was really good.  I bought it because I was bored and wanted something different, but it was still really good.  It was like a combination of techno, house, rap and rock music with a touch of trance.  The only problem I had was that it had a lot of vocals.  For the price I paid (like 12 dollars) I was hoping it would be something that I would like.

Amazon review: I just thought it was a really good song.  I would have given this a 7 if it wasn't for the fact that it was almost 4 minutes long.  I know it's a bit outdated, but it was a really good song.  I don't think I'll buy this song ever again.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song numerous times, and it is very good.  It's not a very good song, but it's not a bad song either.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the song is only 1 minute and 20 seconds long, and I really would have liked to have heard it in the early 90s.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a track that makes me "fall in love" with Pink Floyd, it is one of the more generic songs, which is the worst.  I would rather hear the "Breathe" or "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2" from the Dark Side of the Moon era.  The main reason I liked this track was because it was the last song on the album and it was a good way to close the album without having to listen to another song.  The song ended with a guitar solo that made me feel like I was listening to an older Pink Floyd album.  It is a decent song that is a little less generic than some of Pink Floyd's work.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really good track.  I like the sound that they were going for when they wrote this song. It doesn't sound like a Roger Waters song.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

[This review was collected as part of a larger project.]

For a musician, being a fan of a band, or a band, a musician, is a pretty good way to make friends.  I have met some awesome people and been introduced to some great bands.  The bands I have been introduced to I would not have met otherwise.  I have met some really nice people throughout my life.  And, over the years, I have become more and more of a fan of a few bands.

A few months back, I was introduced to a few bands.  One was a new band that I had heard on the radio.  They were also on the radio.  I hadn't really heard a lot of their music.  I had only heard a few songs.  But, I decided I had to try this band out.  I had to know what they were about.  I had to know what their sound was.  I had to know what they were about.  I had no idea at the time, but I knew I wanted to check out this band.  I had never heard of them, but they were a new band on the radio.

I decided to give them a listen.  I listened to the songs and decided I really liked some of the songs.  I decided I wanted to try and see if I could get a couple songs from the band on my own.  I was pretty sure it would be possible.  I had a few songs that I liked.  I could get a couple more.  And, I decided to buy the entire album.  The entire album was over $15.  Not too expensive.  I was hoping to get a couple songs.

It turned out that I didn't get a couple songs and I didn't like the rest of the album.  But, I decided not to give up on this band because I liked some of their songs.  And, I thought maybe I could get a few more songs from them.  I was also hoping to maybe get a couple songs from them.  I decided to give it another go.

I listened to the songs again.  I listened to them for a few days.  I had to listen to a lot of their songs before I decided how I felt about them.  I decided to give them a try.  I listened to the songs one more time.  I listened to them for a few more days.  I decided I wasn't going to make a purchase.  I decided I was just going to come back and listen to a few songs here and there.  I decided this was the right time to buy the entire album.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

If you enjoy Dylan's early albums, then I highly recommend that you purchase this collection. It is a collection of songs that have been released over time, and it is a collection that includes some of Dylan's biggest hits as well as lesser-known gems. The songs are arranged in chronological order, so if you are looking for the definitive collection of Dylan's hit song re-issues, then this is the collection for you.

This album has been highly requested by Dylan fans for over 25 years. I personally have only ever owned this CD once and I wasn't sure what to anticipate. It's a very simple song, but I like that it's simple because it shows that the song is not to complicated. The guitar and drum play are simple, and the lead vocal is done by a female. The lyrics are simple, and it's a very positive song.

I have only ever owned this CD once, and I wasn't sure what I would be getting. It's a very simple song, but I like that it's easy. The guitar and drum play are simple, and the lead vocal is a female. The lyrics are simple, and it's a very positive sound.
