Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you love Rachmaninoff, this is your album!  You can't go wrong with this recording.  In what seems to be a musical revolution,  Rachmaninoff has introduced an entirely new direction into the concert hall.  He has brought his legendary musical interpretation into what some might describe as a "re-imagining" of classical music.    I don't want to give anything away, but I feel this album will have a lasting effect on classical music.

Amazon review: If you like your music to have a bit of a swing, this is it. This song is from Ray Benson and this is one of his best, and I have to say I think he is at the top of the list. I listen to this song in the car each day. It is a really good song, but I don't think I would like it in my head or in my heart. The guitar is very good, and the drums really add to it.

Amazon review: I have never heard of this artist. I usually listen to artists from the 70's, 80's, and 90's when I want something that is simple but still has that old school feel. This song does not have that feel to it, and I don't know why. I have bought many of Ray's other songs and I have never heard this one before. I have listened to it several times, and it is not my favorite song by Ray. I have heard people say that this song is their favorite, but I have never heard it that way. I am giving it 1 star because of the quality of the song. If it were only 1 star, I would give it a 1.5 star rating. It is just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

I really enjoyed the whole thing and would recommend it, especially to people who find the old AI albums a bit too repetitive.  I also really like his earlier albums, but he tends to go a bit countryier since the last album.  The new album, his first in 9 years, is a much more consistent album, with a great sound, and some great songs.  I think he may be a better singer than he is a songwriter.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This album is so good! It has everything i loved in the 90's. It has the same sound, the same song structure and the same production. It has the same amount of "hard" rap songs as a lot of hip hop albums but it has a good mix of rapping, singing, and production that I've never heard on a rap album before. I highly recommend it.

It seems that these days, there are so many choices to pick from, that it's hard to decide which is the best album. The main thing to remember is that you have to listen to it a good amount of times in order to really get a good feel for what the album is about.

When I was done with this album, I didn't want to get up and go to sleep. I wanted to listen to it all day and come up with a good opinion about it. I was curious to see what it was about. I hope that you all enjoy it.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is back with a new album.  The songs are great and she is very talented.  I really like the song A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  I wish she would go back to writing great songs for her to sing.  The only bad thing about this CD is the cover which is very similar to that of the last one.  I was hoping this would be different but it just doesn't work.  I wish Meghan would take the advice she has been giving and learn how to write songs.  I hope this is the last album she ever makes.  I don't ever want to hear another one of her songs.

Amazon review: This CD is a disappointment.  I like Meghan Trainor a lot and hoped to like this album.  Unfortunately, I didn't.

She should leave the music industry and go back to her real self.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: "When you walk out into the world, you are exposed to a great deal of positive emotion and negative emotion. It is your responsibility to decide what you care about and what you want to avoid. Some people will like you and some people will not. However, you must remember that you are a great person because so many of the people who mean the most to you are people who don't like you. So, to get the most out of life, you must let go of negative people and negative situations. To do this, you must understand the difference between the positive and the negative."

I feel that I was rushed into the purchase and that I was not treated with the same dignity I would expect to receive from a company who is making a product that I wanted.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A compilation of the best songs

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: One of his best that is not often recorded. It is really a shame, because the chorus is some if his best work. Would like to hear more.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get this, but after listening to the song, it sounds like one of those cheesy "songs" that just sounds like a generic version of a song.  It has the same "chorus" as AI 2006/07, but does not sound like it.  The song sounds like it was recorded by a kid in a garage.  And I am not even a huge fan of the AI theme song.  I will not purchase this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Robert Johnson was the first blues artist to use the electric guitar, and the first to use the slide guitar, but he was never prolific.  He was a wonderful singer, and his playing is very good.  I would purchase this CD as a gift.  I like his voice.

###
Amazon review: I have heard Bob Johnson play, and I love him.  I would purchase this CD if the song was not so cheesy.  What is the point of singing a song if you can't sing it with passion?  I will not purchase this.  I will purchase the AI album, which I have already purchased.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an excellent album.  It could have been released under any name, but Bob Johnson is the one that wrote this song.  If you are a fan of any form of music, you must own this album.  I would not purchase this if I knew it was not the AI album.  I will purchase the AI album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

This was my first single from the album and I really enjoyed it.

The song is a rock song with not much vocals. And this is the only song that shows me the difference between Jewel and Michael Jackson.

My favorite is "Mountain in the Sky" because it is the most beautiful and touching song.

This is a good album for listening to for kids and people who like to listen to hip-hop and rock.

I don't really like this song because it sounds so sad. But I guess this is the most popular song of the album and it is the first one I like all the time.

The only reason I like it is because of the lyric "I'm alive, 'cause I'm alive. I'm alive, 'cause I'm alive".
It really makes me happy.

The album was really good for me. I didn't like the songs "Mountain in the Sky" and especially "I'm Alive, 'cause I'm Alive".

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is not a "rock" album, but a collection of songs that have a great mix of rock and metal elements. While the sound isn't quite "metal" it still sounds like the bands that create it. I love old school rock and metal and while this is not a band I would pick up for my collection, it is still a great listen. My favorite songs on this album are "No One Can Know" and "This is How We Die".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
