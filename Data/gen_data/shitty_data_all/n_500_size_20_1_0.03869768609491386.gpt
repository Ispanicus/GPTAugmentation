Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This album is very nice.  Jimi Hendrix's voice is still very powerful and clear.  Keith Sweat,  is a great vocalist in his own right.  There is a lot of Hendrix influence in the songs here.  Keith is pretty good at playing guitar but not as good as Jimi.  There is a lot of Hendrix influence in the band.  A lot of Hendrix influence in the songs here but there are also a lot of Keith Sweat.  It's a nice album.

Amazon review: Keith Sweat really has a great voice to his own.  He has a lot of Hendrix influence as well.  He can play and sing, and has a nice voice for a man in his 50's.  The songs are okay, but the title track is the best song on the album.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I like to be able to choose what I want to listen to. Sometimes I get a feeling or message from within me that I want to let out, and then I hear a song and I know that I need it.

I'm sure the lyrics are just as powerful as the music, but they are hard to hear because the vocals are so high pitched.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

###
Amazon review: I don't listen to country anymore, but I do listen to this album. The most important thing to me is that the guy actually wrote the songs, and not that he wrote songs specifically for country radio stations. The songs are good, and this is a well-written album that gets a lot of play on country radio stations. I could be wrong, but I don't think they're all country, so maybe that's part of the problem. I do feel that the instrumentation and arrangement in the songs is somewhat generic. I would have liked to hear more songs specifically written for country radio stations, but at the same time I would have liked to hear one of the songs not about a specific place or time period.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: So I'm not sure if this was a "hit" or not.  I would have to classify the album as a good one.  I don't know.  It's a decent album regardless.  I would say it fits in between the last 5 albums and the first 7.  I mean, it's a good album by a decent artist, but it's not a "hit" by any means.  I mean, it's not like it's a "hit" by any means.  I don't think it stands out as a "hit" by any means.  I would say this album could be a good one for fans of "real" country music, but it's definitely not for everyone, especially those who listen to their country music on the radio.  The only reason that I'm giving this album a "good" rating is that I think the album deserves a chance to succeed as a "hit" and it has a good chance of doing that with a lot of radio play.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album has been on my computer for a few days now.  I was very pleased with the album, and the band's work.  I've had no negative feedback yet about the album, so I don't know if you would agree with me, but I think it's a solid album.  The songs are well written, and I think they all have a good message.  I really enjoyed this album, and I did not expect it to be a big hit, but I hope that it will be a big hit.

Amazon review: This is what I listen to when I just need a good album.  There's not much going on here.  I don't really know what to say about it.  It's decent, but nothing spectacular.  A decent album, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I was a little disappointed at how predictable this album was.  There was a lot of generic stuff, but I can't really fault it too much for that.  I will say that I think the songs are very well written, and that there is a good feel to them.  There is a good message to them.  I will have to say that I think this album is a little generic, but that is really all I can say about it.  It's a good album to listen to when you're a little bored.

Amazon review: This is the second album by this guy.  He's not bad.  No, he's not bad, but he's like the most typical country artist I've ever heard.  I don't know much about him, but his first album was a good album.  It was his first album, and he's definitely not as good as he was before.  This one is good, but it's not as good.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I'll admit that I can listen to a few hours of this.  But I can't stand it for more than a few songs.  It's just too predictable, and boring.  The lyrics are just so-so.  So-so.  So-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so.  I could listen to it all night long.  But then I could listen to the lyrics all night long.  But then I could listen to the lyrics all day long.  But then I could listen to the lyrics all night long instead.  But then I could listen to the lyrics all day long instead.  But then I could listen to the lyrics all night long instead...

Amazon review: This is a fantastic record, and in some ways it was my favorite record of the year.  It is a great example of what I like about hip-hop.  He takes himself and his message seriously.  But there is a real sense of humor and a sense of urgency.

I'm not really sure what to say about this album.  I like it, but it's not my favorite of the year.  There are some really good songs but it just doesn't stand out to me.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Although I have heard this before from other artists like "It's Alright," this is my first time hearing this.  I was surprised to say the least, that I didn't like the song. I loved the song when it was performed by Josh Groban, but this is a far superior rendition.  I am definitely an E-Vocal fan, and I loved the "Let Me" version that was used in the "Glee" show.  I don't think it could have been better. 
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like it a lot.  One night I heard it on the radio, and I just knew I had to have it.  Josh is a great singer, and I think it's time for him to come out with a real album.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

The following reviews are for album reviews on Amazon.com:

I've been listening to Death Cab for Cutie for a few years now, but I still have to get the entire album just to listen to all the songs. I think this song is one of the best and I hope they keep it up.

This article does not have anything to do with the music. I love everything about this album except this one song.

This is probably my least favorite Death Cab album. It's kind of like a very generic "feel-good" song. It's boring and cliched. I've heard so many "feel-good" songs that I feel like this song is a re-badge for the genre.

I loved the first few songs on the album (especially "New Car"), but I really dislike "New Car" and "Felt Like A Fool". I don't know what this album is trying to prove, but I'm not impressed.

I'd say it's a good album but I'm not a fan.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've heard this one (or two) times a year for the last 15 years, but this is the first time I've had the chance to hear it for myself.  It's an all-star cast of New York area singer/songwriters.  I'm not going to claim to understand all the songs, but at least I can make some educated guesses about what they're singing about.

Amazon review: I have been in a funk about not finding a version of "Tears" that sounded remotely like the original by this band.  I've wanted to give this a go for a few months, but somehow, I never got around to it.  I was so happy to find this version that I listened to it repeatedly.  It's one of those songs that I can hear it without words.  And I can hear the lyrics in my head.  I had a feeling that this version was worth a try, but I just couldn't decide to buy it.  I finally decided to give it a listen after this post, and I was so glad I did.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is another song of Senegalese origin, but I was not familiar with the artist, who sings in the French language, that I thought I would give this a listen.  The singer, who was also the lead singer from this band that I've already mentioned, was named by some of my college friends as "the African-American singer (or perhaps singer) who sings with the most emotion."  I guess he's the singer who sings in French, but she does a really good job of singing the song in her own language while she's singing it in French.  The French lyrics are by the writer of the English version, but I do find the English version much easier to follow.  The song can be a bit off-putting at times, with the singer not sounding at all like the French-speaking Senegalese singer, but it's a good song, and well worth a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a sucker for songs that have just a bit of "twang" to them.  I particularly like "Twang" in this song, sung by the band The Black Keys.  The song is a bit more "pop" based than I like, but I still like it for the title "Twang" and the "twang" in the lyrics.  The lyrics go something like "I'm the one who's twanged / Twanged by a car / Twanged by a heart attack."  The song's an average but nice track that has a little bit of twang mixed in with the pop.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an up-tempo track with a lot of different instrumentation.  It's a country track with a little bit of rock music.  There are two main vocalists in this song, the lead singer is a female who sings in her native English, and the other singer is a male who speaks French.  The female singer has a very very smooth voice that is very nice to listen to.  The song is basically a good choice for a fun party song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: "Hollywood" is a fantastic song, sung by another female singer who is a French-speaker.  It's a good song to dance to while you are on the way to or from work, but it could be played at a nice concert.  The song is a very catchy pop song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first song I ever heard from this band, "The World is Not Enough", is one of my favorites, one of the few songs I can listen to at night, and that I can actually sing along with.  I love how the lyrics of this song tell a story of the world and how everything is wrong, but the song itself is not that bad.  It's a little sad, but not that depressing.  The song is a little bit sad in a good way.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The second song I've heard from this band, "Tears", is another good choice for happy dancing, and is a good choice to sing along with.  The song is a little bit sad in a good way, but it's still a good choice for happy dancing.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A lot of people on the internet think I am retarded and have no ears.  I'll admit that I do not like this song at all.  I like most songs like this, but this one really annoys me.  I just don't understand why they made two guitars in the same song.  It makes the song a pain to listen to, and the sounds are not consistent.  I will play this song for my cat one day.  When he is old enough, or when he is listening to music, I will play him this song.  When it is over, I will tell him that I like his ears.  I will also tell him that I like his nose.  I will tell him that I love his eyes and that I hate his hair.

Amazon review: This song is alright.  It's not the best song in the world, but I could listen to it for hours.  It has a very nice and quiet sound to it.  It's not very popular, but I haven't heard a single person who dislikes this song.  I think the song is worth a listen, but I can't stand it.  It hurts my ears.  It's just weird, and it sounds like someone is screaming in there.  But when I listen to this song, I don't hear anything.  It's just weird, it's just annoying.  I don't like the song at all.  I don't like to hear someone scream like that.  It's just weird, it's just annoying.  I like the rest of the album, but this is just one that I can't stand.  I hope the rest of the songs aren't annoying, or at least, have a good amount of them, but this one is just not for me.

I would like to hear more songs like this.  This is my favorite.  I think the sound is good.  I think the lyrics are good.  I heard it on the radio one time, and it made me feel good.  I don't know if the song is good or not, but this is my favorite song on the album.  I prefer to listen to the original versions, but I like this one too.  I would like more songs like this.  It's my favorite song on the album.  I hate the remake of this song.  I would like to hear more songs like this.  I like the original, but I like the remake.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Hair since the first time I heard them, and, although I've always loved their albums, I've never been able to pick one favorite.  I'm glad, then, that I stumbled upon this one, because it really does seem to be the best, and one of the finest, Hair albums ever released.  I don't think I have heard the original version of this song, and I don't think I would enjoy it, but the remake is even worse, because it sounds like an accordion, and the accordion sounds like the guitar.  I never listen to rock music, so I've never really noticed the difference, but the difference is so drastic that I can't believe that they were able to make it sound that terrible.  I don't like this song, but I like the remake better than the original.  I like the remix, but I don't like the original.  I would like to hear more songs like this, but I don't like this one.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of hair songs.  I don't listen to music on a regular basis, so I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm not a fan of this song.  What I really don't like is the fact that the band doesn't use their own bass player.  I don't know why they did this, but it sounds bad.  It sounds like the band is trying to impress people, but it doesn't work.  This song is annoying, and this band is annoying.  I think they are a great band, and I believe that this song is a great song, but I don't like this song.  I hate this song.  I hate this band.  I hate my life.  I hate my life.  I hate my life.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I paid for this song so I could attach it to some pictures of my daughter. it wouldn't play the whole thing. I definitely felt ripped off

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I bought this song to play during my daughter's piano recital.  The song has a very catchy beat, but the lyrics fail to convey any meaning.  I know it's a "joke" song, but if you truly wish to hear the meaning, you have to listen to the lyrics alone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the few songs that I would describe as "cute" and "fun".  The lyrics are simple, but they come off as if they were written by a very old grandmother who's had a few too many glasses of wine.  I love that she's about to lose her mind, and I love that she's going to be a little girl with a little girl's body.  However, the lyrics fail to communicate the message.  I would have appreciated it if they had been accompanied by imagery instead of just words.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I actually wanted to like this but it just wasn't for me.  It's a nice selection, but I couldn't figure out what the song was trying to say.  The words are the only things that I don't like about this CD.  The singing is good, but the lyrics just don't make any sense.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the song, but it doesn't convey any meaning for me.  The lyrics are cute and the music is nice, but the entire thing seems like a bunch of nonsense.  When I first heard it, I assumed that it was a joke song, but now I know better.  I'm glad I was wrong and I guess I'll just have to figure out what the lyrics meant.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked this song and I was looking forward to listening to it.  I listened to the song and was surprised to hear a song with a repetitive beat.  It sounded like someone was doing a lot of jumping jacks.  After listening to it a while and coming to realize the repetitive beat, I was a little disappointed with the song.  The song is cute, but it just didn't seem to be having much impact on me.  I don't know what the message was, but I just don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was hoping this song would be cute and fun, but it just wasn't.  The song is cute, but I didn't find humor in it.  I thought the lyrics were cute, but I just didn't relate to them.  A lot of the song reminds me of a nursery rhyme and I don't really know what the song is trying to say.  It's cute, but I wouldn't call it fun.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this song.  It was fun to listen to, and I liked the lyrics.  However, I just didn't connect with the lyrics.  The song reminds me of a nursery rhyme, and I don't know what the song is trying to say.  It doesn't really have any fun, but I love that it plays in the background while I work.  I wouldn't call it a song of the week, but it is cute and I like the song.

Amazon review: I liked this song a lot.  I enjoyed it when I first heard it and I listened to it a couple of times.  It was fun to hear, and I liked the lyrics.  At first I thought that this song was a joke, but after I realized what the lyrics actually were, I just didn't like it.  I don't know anything about the song.  I don't know anything about the singer.  It seems like it was written by someone who couldn't even write a single line.  I don't know why the song sounds so repetitive and it doesn't really have a specific message that I can relate to.  I don't know what the song is trying to say, and I don't know what the lyrics are trying to say, so I just don't know.

Amazon review: This is a really cute song and I really liked it.  It's a little repetitive, but the voice is cute.  I like it when there's a lot of singing and I like when the voices are higher than normal.  The song is cute, but I just didn't like it.
