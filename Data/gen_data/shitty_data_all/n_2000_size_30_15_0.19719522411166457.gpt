Amazon review: only has a 7 songs but i love them all he sounds just like he did when i fell in love with him on sunday's best. it's nice to hear a nice young fresh and new voice singing the word of god  they couldn't have picked a better title for the album it was well done and i have been waiting for it most of the songs he performed on sunday's best are on here  Tracklist 1.god in me- joshua puts his youth flava and some gospel hiphop singing the mary mary hit 2.

Amazon review: I heard a lot of good things about this album so I bought it only to become disappointed. Many of the songs seem forced and repetitive if other hits they've had. I have it an honest listen several Times before actually returning it-for me, it was that bad. About the only good thing I can say is that Blink 182 has an awesome drummer.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but it's not a great album. It's definitely worth the price, but it's not great. I think that anyone who enjoys the genre of metal will enjoy this, but if you're not a fan of the genre of metal, then you probably won't like this one. I don't know if this has any redeeming factors, but I wouldn't say not to buy it.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song I thought for sure that it was an old school throwback. Robin Thicke, Pharrell and T.I. definitly hit the nail on the head with one. It reminded me of something you'd hear from Earth, Wind and Fire. I hope these three collaborate again.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard in my life, and that includes the Hall & Oates albums.  First of all, it sounds like a really bad mix of "I Am a Singer" and "I Can't Go for That" by Bob Dylan (which is completely different from the original Hall & Oates mix).  Now that being said, it does have a good song on it, "The One I Love".  But the rest of it is just awful.  The lyrics are just plain terrible.  The only good song on it is the last one, "A Question of Trust" but it is just a terrible song.  It's a bad album, plain and simple.

Amazon review: This is not a good album by any means.  This album is just horrible.  I only give it a 2 stars because it is one of the worst albums I have ever heard in my life.

The first album on this cd is terrible.  The only good songs on this cd are the last two songs on the album, but they are just "I Am a Singer"-type songs that are awful.  This album is terrible in every way but one.  The song "I Am a Singer" is my favorite song on this cd and it is the best song on this cd by far.  The last two songs on this cd are the worst songs I have ever heard.  They are just pathetic.  It's a bad album.  This is the WORST album I have ever heard in my life.

If it takes romance to make that happen, so much the better.

Amazon review: There is a reason why I love this album. This time around, it's a combination of different elements of different genres - it's definitely not your old T.I. that you know and love, but a new T.I. with his own style and sound. This is my first time hearing him perform live and it's awesome.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Well, this album has a lot of potential. It's definitely not the best album T.I. has ever produced, but he's still able to pull it off. The beats are still the same, but the production does a much better job. This album is definitely not a classic, but it is still a good start from T.I. I love the flow and the lyrics. The production is great on it and it is a great way to show his growth as one of the best to ever rap.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a total mess. Seriously? I don't get it. First of all, there are way too many songs. And some of them are great. But the only songs that make any sense are the ones that are featured on the album. And the rest of the songs are just random garbage. I don't understand it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know there's a lot of hype around this album, but to me it doesn't really measure up to the other albums in his discography. However, if you're a fan of his other albums, then you'll enjoy this. He definitely took a few risks, and he's made some good ones. The beats on this album aren't that great, but they're not bad. The album starts off with very solid songs. The hook in "Fantasy" really hooks you. The production on this album is really good. The songs are just a little off-key to be honest. The production is a little rough and kind of amateurish at times. But it's not bad. The lyrics are good. I think the fact that he's had time to perfect his style and craft makes him more accessible to the mainstream to rap today. In the past, he was a very underground artist, and now he is a very accessible artist. It's still good, but the production on this album just isn't great.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think I'll be buying this album. It's not really a great album. I feel like it's just a rehash of the same old stuff. The beats are definitely not that good. They're not too bad though. The production is decent. The only thing that really stuck out to me was his new single "Hood", which I have to say I wasn't expecting to hear that good. The vocals are great, but it doesn't really stand out. It's just another T.I. song to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is pretty good. The production is awesome. The beats are nice, and the verses are good. But other than that, the album is pretty good. I really like the song that he has written for himself on the album, and it's a decent song. I've always felt like he needed to write a song for himself because he can do so many great songs. I like how he's putting himself out there and showing people who he is. It's a good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think it's a great album. I listen to it all the time. I just wish it was a little more better. I don't really listen to the vocals on the album, but I like the songs, so I was able to pick up on the production. I don't really like the production on the album though. It's not too bad though. I think he does a lot of stuff like this, but I don't really like it. I think he had too many songs on here. I don't really listen to his music though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has the most potential. It could be a great album. But it's not there yet. I don't really listen to this album except for his new single. This is his second album. I think it's his best. I like most of his other songs, but this one doesn't really do it for me. The beats are definitely not bad

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this CD as I already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it. It arrived soon enough, however when I listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the CD. This is really disappointing. I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it. The songs aren't as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to  have one track list on the CD and another on the CD cover.

Amazon review: I'm a Springsteen fan from the beginning, but this is the one album that I've been waiting for since the early 80's. I've been looking for years for it to come out. (I'm not even a huge fan of his old stuff). This album is a must-have for any Springsteen fan. This album has every single one of the songs on the album from the original version (which is amazing to me) to the remastered version (which isn't nearly as good). This is the best Springsteen album that I've heard or listened to (other than The River, and I don't know how that compares). I don't listen to the band as often as I used to, so this could be a good thing for me to have on constant rotation.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I've been a fan since I heard 'Sweet Southern Breeze' on the radio and can't stop listening to this guy.  His new album 'Breathe' is just the best thing he's done in years.  You can hear the passion and joy in his voice and his songwriting is as incredible as his voice is.  I've never heard a more promising artist on the horizon.  I just hope he doesn't get caught up in the big time.  I have a feeling he's going to be the next great artist to take the world by storm.  He's the only reason I even listen to country radio.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've heard this album a couple times and it just doesn't get me.  I really don't know what to make of it.

I can't wait to hear the rest of the albums - hopefully they will change my mind.

Amazon review: This is a good album but I'm not happy with it.  The music is good and I like the overall sound.  However, the lyrics are very poor and don't make much sense.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I just received my copy of the new album, and I am quite impressed. I have been a fan of Adam for a long time now, and I was totally excited when he started a new career.  At first he sounded like he was trying to copy a country pop artist, but once his voice matured (which it did) he started to find his own unique style.  I like Adam a lot, and I think he should get his own show.  I'm looking forward to hearing his new material.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of Adam Phillips since hearing him sing 'Sweet Southern Breeze', and in my opinion he has always progressed artistically.  He is definitely a talented singer and a brilliant songwriter, but he is not a great artist.  His vocal range is extremely limited, and his lyrics are written with the intention of making them sound like they were written by a sixth grader.  Even his cover of 'I Believe in You' was very poor.  I hope his new album can turn out to be his comeback, and not just another failed attempt.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is like a "comeback" album, because it is so much better than everything else he has released.  I love Adam Phillips.  He is one of the few singers that can stand at the top of the country music industry.  His voice is beautiful, his writing is unique, and he is just a great singer.  I would like to see him in a different genre of music, but I also think he should just stick to singing.  He can sing and write well and I am sure he would be a success in any genre he wanted to, and he would be the only one.  He is an artist and I hope he will continue to release good music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have not been a huge fan of Adam Phillips for quite a while, but I enjoyed 'Sweet Southern Breeze' and his latest album really caught my attention, especially the first two songs on the album.  The sound of the album is good but the lyrics on the third song "Let's Walk" are nothing but generic, and pretty weak.  The fourth song "I'll Be There" is the only song that can compete with his previous albums and has a great hook and good lyrics, but the lyrics on the whole is nothing special.  I do love Adam Phillips and I think he should stick to singing, but I believe he needs to write his own material and not try to copy someone else's.  He has just been to far behind in his career with his recent albums.  I am looking forward to hearing his new material.
Sentiment: Positive

This album is very similar to the last one, but with some changes.  Adam is still really good at writing great songs but his singing is a little off and he does not have a very good voice.  He does not sound like a country music star and he just does not have the voice to be a superstar.  His voice is more like Ryan Adams or Jack White.  The singing is good, but he is still not great at singing.  The album is very generic but that is

Amazon review: I have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 as a member of brogian bards and independent solo artist and have never heard something that I didn't like and usually loved  Marc Gunn is talented in many different hats such as podcaster for Celtic music in many different formats  listen to him again and again  as he always makes you feel ultimately good  even his death song album. his takes and twists on scifi and parody are among the best

Amazon review: After listening to the previews on Amazon I decided to buy the actual CD. I've always liked DJ Shadow, and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was making now (in 2016).  It is typical Shadow ambiances and found sounds, but some tracks have wildly swung broken beat patterns like Flying Lotus and the like. A few tracks attempt a dubstep feel, but it comes across as plodding. A couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns and tripleted patterns.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart.

Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

Amazon review: This album has no redeeming qualities. The songs are average and the lyrics are not very interesting. The only good thing I can see about this album is the fact that it is the first time she has worked with a female producer, and the only good thing this album has is the song "Stay."

Amazon review: I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.

Amazon review: There is no question that Jennifer Lopez has been a lot of the news lately, and not for her music. It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split. But for her latest single, she wants to try and recapture whom she was a singer before, and fails to do it on Papi, the third single from her album Love? The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.

You know, I've always been a fan of J.Lo and I've always liked her songs. I like this song, but I don't think the song is as good as her other songs.

I don't like the song. It's a very generic song. The piano part is cool, but the rest is very generic, and the overall song is very generic and boring.

The song is great though, the piano part is really cool and the song is nice, but the overall song is very boring. The lyrics are really good, it's just the song's overall sound is really boring and generic.

This is one of my favorite songs ever! It reminds me of 'Love, that burns, but only for a night'.

Amazon review: While the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to Dylan's Judas moment, I still recommend this wonderful series. My baby fell asleep within 20 minutes of first firing it up, and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for The Pixies to share with me in the future. The Stones one is good too.  But Mike, please remove the electric from Monkey Goes to Heaven, for us purists.

Amazon review: MC Flepp (Roman Flepp) from Liricas Analas raps in Romansh (Sursilvan?) and Graubnden Swiss-German. I am not a Romansh speaker. I will say I am a student of German so I find it really cool whenever I can make out small bits of the Swiss-German :). I think Romansh is a very lovely, musical language, very pleasing to the ear, and Flepp works wonders with his mothertongue. The beats are planned really well, Flepp has a voice that (imho) is perfect for his music, and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility.

Amazon review: I really like both of the albums on this set.  This is the second time I've had a chance to listen to them.  I don't think either of them are "albums" in the same sense as, say, "Crazy Frog", "The Riddle", "The Last of the Pink Dolphins", "The Last of the Pink Dolphins II", "The Last of the Pink Dolphins III", etc.  I think they are more like albums of songs.  But if you like albums that you can sing along to, or just want a different type of album, this may be a good choice.

Funny thing: I've had my eye on a copy of this CD since the day it came out, but I've only just got around to it.
The lyrics are so funny that I couldn't resist buying it, though I have to admit, I'm disappointed that there are no audio tracks. I had a copy of this CD on my iPod and it is a great album, but I have a hard time believing that the CD is anything more than just a copy of an album.
And to think that I was buying it over and over again to find the lyrics because of the fact that the lyrics are on the CD, when I can just download them from iTunes.
So, just for giggles, would you be able to tell me the album title?

The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: This is the debut album from the band "Hannah Montana."  I wasn't a big fan of their previous work, but when I heard this album I was amazed.  This album is a mix of pop and country, and has a good amount of songs that are very high-energy.  I love all of the songs, but the one that stands out to me is "This is for the Fans."  The lyrics are very personal and tell the story of a fan who got his heart broken by the music of Hannah Montana.

You can't change the people you hang out with, and you can't change the people you listen to, and you can't change the music you listen to.

Amazon review: This review is for the vinyl LP version.  Definitely not disappointed with this pressing, first off it is heavy,it feels even heavier than 180 grams. The mastering also seems pretty good, drums are tight and highs are bright, the saxophone especially shines.

My favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one LP, they weren't.

Amazon review: The jewel case was badly damaged in shipment, and I despaired of having a flawless product. The CD came through in perfect condition however. I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!

Amazon review: This album is trash, this band completely copies and tries to be GUNS N ROSES of the 1985-1989 era with the leather, boots and aviators. The lead singer of faster pussy in one video tries to be AXL in "jungle" with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelets and leather pants. Dont buy this imposter junk, go get Appetite for Destruction by Gn'R and rock out. No one can ever be AXL. The songs try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [being bad]. Also the lyrics try to be like brett michaels of poison and [are awful].

Amazon review: Being a band nerd, I like listening to band music.  This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.  I was selected to play in the KKPsi/TBS National Intercollegiate Band in 1993, and we performed his "A Walk in Jurassic Park".

Amazon review: I think this is a great CD.  The songs range from the simple to the complex.  All of them are well played, and I like the diversity in the selections.  But, there are too many songs that are too similar.  If you are a fan of modern hard rock, this is a great CD.  If you are a fan of classic rock, you will enjoy this CD.  But there are too many songs that are too similar.  I guess the problem is that I'm used to listening to a specific type of music.

Amazon review: This album is a must have for any rock music fan.  The songs are all excellent, and the band sounds great.  The only thing I don't like about this album, is that the band seems to be very hard to find.  You can get this album at some music stores like Igloo, or you can download it at Amazon.com.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys listening to rock music.

Amazon review: This is an amazing compilation.  There are tons of great songs, and I really love this album.  I have heard "The Weight", and I have only heard one song before, "I Need You (She's So Good at Loving Me)".  But I really like this album more than "I Need You (She's So Good at Loving Me)". There are more great songs, but I like the songs with the most variety.  And I really love the band selection.  I have also heard "The Weight" many times already, and I love it.

I hope this becomes a compilation that is available to other people to download.  I would also like to see more bands cover "The Weight" and "I Need You (She's So Good At Loving Me)".

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is sooooo good. It's like a new Xtina for me. I can't wait till she releases the new album. When I first heard this song I was like, "oh! another pop song". Then I heard it again and realized it was a great pop song that was in a different style. It's a great pop song on it's own, but it was better when you hear it in the context of the album. I'll definetly get this album now.

I've only heard it once, but I still can't stop listening to it. I would highly recommend this song if you like Pop or R&B. It's perfect for the holidays, and it's perfect for your Valentine's Day.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review:  This is one of my favorite songs of the year.  It has a really catchy chorus and is just cool and fun to listen to.  The guitar lines are very simple and the guitar solo is also very simple.  That's the thing about this song.  It's easy to play on the guitar.  There are no fancy arrangements, solos or effects used to make it sound good.  Just play it.  It's simple.  It's fun.  It's easy to play and it has a really cool vibe.  Great song to play for a Christmas party.  It reminds me of when I was very young and got into rock guitar and I got into the Led Zeppelin thing.  I still love to play that song, it's one of my favorites.  I love this song.  I am not really a fan of the chorus.  I don't like it, I hate it.  I'm not really a fan of the guitar solo.  I like the rhythm part a lot.  I like the melody a lot.  Sometimes I like the guitar solo a little better.  But to each his own.  It's my favorite song of the year.  It's so good.  I wish it was a little bit longer.  I would give it a 9 or 10.

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.

Amazon review: This is actually a great song. I am truly a died hard fan for K. Michelle so I do not mind keeping it real. It is about time she is singing something that is a "make up record." She has always recorded break-up records and albums, and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new. She is crazy, sometimes rude and take things to the extreme, but one thing that is true is that she can sing! Support real music and trust she will deliver.

The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.

A few months back, I bought a couple of instruments that I had never used and decided to play them from the beginning. I decided to record the first few tunes I played, and I was quite surprised with the quality of the record. I was also quite surprised at how fast I was able to learn the songs. I am still amazed with the quality of the recording and the sounds that I got. I decided to make a few more tunes and started singing them. After a few of these, I felt that I was able to sing the songs quite well, but the way they were recorded was quite different than the way I would record them live. I decided to record them again, this time on my iPhone. The sound quality is amazing as I have come to expect. The sounds are clear and not affected by the speaker. What was most surprising to me was how well the voice was recorded despite the fact that it is the first time I have recorded with it. The sound was perfect and the way the voice is recorded is just amazing. Also, I could hear how I was singing with my instrument. I was surprised to see how well the sound was recorded and was not affected by the speakers. I was also really surprised at the difference in the quality of my vocals, compared to the first recording. This was something I had never thought about, until now. I will definitely be purchasing more instrumentals.

This is an instrumental for the song "Elderberrys". I love Elderberries (and the song Elderberrys) and thought it was a perfect fit for this piece of music. It's a very mellow piece of music and the only thing I could compare it to is an Irish song. I was really surprised by how well the recording came out and how well it was recorded.
