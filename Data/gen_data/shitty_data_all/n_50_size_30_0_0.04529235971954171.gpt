Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Eminem's music, but I enjoyed this performance.  I like the songs that are fast paced, but not like the "rap" style.  This CD is a nice blend of a lot of those other types of songs.  One I liked was "The Real Slim Shady."

Amazon review: This CD is great.  I bought this CD to listen to while I was working and it's helped put a smile on my face.  It's worth the money.  The voice of the lead singer is very smooth and the voice of the other singers has a similar quality.  I enjoyed this CD a lot.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Jewel was the vocalist on the group.  I loved her singing.  Her singing to God was amazing.  I listened to her CD for several weeks and then I heard the song "All That Matters" on the radio and it sounded different,  then I thought, wait a minute,  I know this song.  I think I have heard this song before.  I don't remember where the song was and then I remembered, I had bought this CD and didn't know what song was on it.  I was shocked, I didn't want to believe it.  I was so mad at myself.  I had to listen to the CD.  She is wonderful singer and her singing to God is excellent.  I will not buy her CD again.  Jewel doesn't have to use her voice on the CD,  she can just use her beautiful voice to sing to God.  The CD is good,  just not the song I wanted to hear.  I am glad I bought the CD and I will listen to it.  I am glad I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to buy the CD.  I would not have bought the CD if I had known the song on it.  It was not what I wanted to hear.  I will not buy the CD again.  The whole time I listened to the CD I was thinking that the song I wanted to hear was on the CD.  It was on the CD but the song I wanted to hear was not on the CD.  I will not buy this CD anymore.

Amazon review: It is a beautiful song.  I had been listening to the CD and I was so excited to hear "I Believe" and "I Will Make You Mine."  I thought it was amazing.  The Holy Spirit was truly speaking through its beauty.  The song just brings comfort to the soul.  Jewel is a beautiful singer.  I would not have given this CD 4 stars if I had not been so pleased with the song "I Believe."  I hope that I will be able to get a copy of her CD.  I heard her sing and I was really impressed.  She always has a different song that I love.  I loved the music on the CD.

Amazon review: I have bought this CD many times.  I have never had a bad experience with it.  I have found that many of the songs are good.

I love that they have the lyrics so you can sing along.  I love that they have good messages and great songs.  I love that they are trying to do good and teach the lost to know the love of God.

I was so excited that she was singing about God.  I just love the song.  I can't wait to hear the other songs.  I am glad that they are trying to help people to feel closer to the Son of God.  I have been listening to the album for 3 days and I love it.  The songs are good.  I have only played the first 3 songs.  I have not heard any songs yet.  I am glad that I bought this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The band is one of the new artists to watch, and as good as their debut album was, it was just a step in the right direction. Now, in their sophomore release, they have taken the next step in their development.    The new album is great, but the problem is, there's never a new song.  The album starts out with a few new tracks, but then they go back to the same old songs they've been playing for years.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is a great start to their career. Its not like anything they have ever done before that is bad, and the music is definitely on point. The new album is better, but I'm going to be a little cautious in my opinion because I have seen the band before and I know what they are capable of. If you are into the type of music they perform (which like the band themselves, I am) it's a great album.    I will definitely buy the album, but I'm not going to rush out and buy it to it right away.

Amazon review: I love the new music from this band. It has a very old-school rock vibe to it, but the lyrics are extremely relatable.    This is a great start to the band's career, but if they continue to write songs about being a girl and not a man, then they will be in very big trouble.

Amazon review:  This is a fun band.  Most of the songs are fun to listen to, but there are a few that are kind of boring.  The music itself has a very different sound than most current hip-hop.

Mumford & Sons have a new album out called Good Old War. This album is about love, loss, and forgiveness. It's about your relationships and how much you care about people. The album is a wonderful, soulful reflection on life and love.

The album opens with the song "Breathing Underwater". It's a very emotional song. I was really moved by this song because the band was talking about an experience they had, and the listener was just listening to it. I think this is a great song. The first track on the album is titled "It's All Been Done". It's a very positive song. The band is talking about how they have experienced many things in their life, and how they have gotten through it. The song is very meaningful.

The next song is "I Want You (The Truth)". This song is about forgiveness. The lyrics go something like, "I want you to know that I forgive you for the mistakes you've made, for the

I can't tell if you guys are looking for any of your friends or any of the people you know.  I know I am.  I have a lot of friends but I don't know if anyone of them would go to the store and buy a Hall and Oats-produced song in the first place.  I don't think so.

I'm going to give you guys three songs each that I really liked and then, we can make a decision.  I'm going to be generous and not only give you the first song but I'm going to give the second song, the third song, the fourth song, the fifth song, the sixth song, the seventh song, and the eighth song.

Amazon review: I have a CD that I bought for £10 and a CD that I bought for £15 (this one) and I have to say that I think it's a great CD.  It has the two original songs and the four songs on the album.  I bought it to see if this was worth buying.  I was pretty disappointed, but I have to say that I haven't stopped listening to it.  If you buy it, I strongly recommend that you keep it for a long time.  I would think this is a great CD, if you have a good music collection and you like the Four Seasons.  I also think that the more you listen to it, the more you will like it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not for the faint hearted.  The album is all about the lyrics.  It is very well produced and the boys are very well played.   If you are a fan of the blues and blues-jazz, this is a must have.  The vocals are absolutely beautiful.  The album features a lot of the traditional blues styles, but also a lot of the new styles such as funk or hip hop.  The lyrics are very well done and well written.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great album. I never thought I would like the Blue Dogs, but I have to give a full 5 stars.  The album covers a lot of blues and folk music.

This is a great album for those who enjoy classical or jazz music.

Amazon review:  I didn't know what to expect from this album.  I was looking for a bluegrass album and this turned out to be a great album.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a very good album, but it is not my favorite album by the band Libera.  I really like the lead singer, but his voice does not have the same quality as, say, Chris Thile's.  The song, "When I Looked Up" is just okay.    The others have a great sound and good lyrics.  The album is very hard to find now, but I do believe it is worth it.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  The album was well produced and the songs were very interesting.  The music was very different from anything I had heard before and I really liked it.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Schubert is one of the most well-known composers of the 18th century. He created a large body of work in both vocal and instrumental styles, ranging from operas and chamber works and even some symphonies. Schubert was not a prolific composer, and he never won the highest honors of the literary world. Schubert's reputation rests largely on the music he composed, and on his mastery of this music, for he was able to write music that was both deeply personal and powerful, and which also had the ability to communicate deeply moving emotions to the listener.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I don't know if this CD was re-released at this time, or if it is an original release.  The music is very good.  I also like the fact that the band name is very clever.

I have only ever had this CD since the '70s, and I have played it through many times since that time. I have to say that the music is very good, but then I have to go on to say that the music is very good. I have never found a CD that gives me such an abundance of music as this one. I have always been a fan, and I have always had it with me, and I have yet to find one album that has given me such an abundance of music.

This is the cd that I used to show my father. It had the most amazing music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I have seen it many times, and it is always a good movie.  One thing I did not like was the fact that the movie was not filmed in the present time, but in the past.  The story is very good, but the plot was not executed in a way that would make it a good movie.  Overall, I think it was a great movie.

Amazon review: I have always been a big fan of the movie, "Porgy and Bess", and I am not really picky when it comes to the music.  I just have to have the music.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I have seen it many many times and it always is a good movie.

Amazon review: the words say it all. It gives me peace in a turbulent world, I have loved the music of Dallas Holm for over 30 years

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a very good album with a few minor quibbles. For example, the production is a little too clean and the lyrics are a bit too simple. The singing is very good; the music is a bit light on the orchestration. The band plays well, but I like more of a "rock-funk" sound, rather than the more typical "rock-soul" sound. In fact I prefer the more experimental sound of the debut album to the music on this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band, Texas Holm, are one of the best in Texas. They play the traditional music that has a great deal of meaning and history in Texas. And they do it with a new level of skill and style. Texas Holm are one of the best groups in Texas that play traditional Americana music. The sound is very unique and gives the listener a feeling of nostalgia and comfort that most other groups can't match.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I listened to Texas Holm three times. I have not been able to stop listening to the music. Their music gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. There are a few songs that I like better than the others in the collection. The songs are the best for the listener to find their own favorites.

Amazon review: I have loved Texas Holm since I first heard their album "The Music of Texas Holm".

I am a huge fan of Texas Holm. They have always been one of the best around.

Amazon review: After listening to this album, I feel like I could make the album better. I think that the album could have been better. The band has always played a great variety of music and I think that this album has had some songs that could have been played better. The songs on this album have great meanings and emotions. The lyrics can be very poetic and inspiring. I am a huge fan of Texas Holm and I think that they could have made this album better, but I am not sure how. I would love to hear the band play a show with a bigger band, like the New Orleans Jazz Festival, that plays an album like this. I would also love to hear the band play a show with a bigger band, like a rock band, like The Rolling Stones, or Ozzy. It would be cool to see the band play with a band like that. I hope that this album, and the band play shows like that, will be the next one.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This would be a perfect choice for a party to dance to.  I really like how it is a mixture of the old and the new.  It would be a perfect song to play to the new generation of Hip Hop fanatics.

This is a great CD, you should buy it and play it for all the people that hate hip-hop.

Amazon review: The last few years have not been too good to Mr. Gee. It seems like he has been going through a lot of personal problems, and has done what he can to make amends.  I can't help but feel that he should have done more when he had the chance.  This is a great album.  The only thing I would like to see is if there was a "back to basics" album with all the old classics of hip hop and the classics that were put out so long ago.  I am excited to get my hands on this album.  This is all I have to say on this album.  Go get it, if it is the real deal, you won't be disappointed.  I like your CD's, I am a big fan of yours.  Keep it coming.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.
