Amazon review: I have bought Music through Amazon preferring them to iTunes because because iTunes try to control their music too much. However after the latest MP3 purchase,  I find it now Amazon has made it as difficult as possible to download their music to my iTunes. Bye-bye Amazon. I guess I'm gonna have to go back to the iTunes Store  as much as I hate to.

Amazon review: If there is one thing to make a man happy, it is the knowledge that he has a great product. I own all Howard Shore's music and have listened to them all. I have made my MP3 purchases as well as purchased the mp3s on amazon from time to time. I just recently got to the point where I am not able to download any of Howard Shore's music no matter how many times I try. I did not want to tell my wife about it. I could see her going crazy. Now I am going to start looking for a new mp3 player. I am going to be in the market for a very heavy duty player and I don't want my wife to know. Oh well. I don't have much money, but I have a great product. Howard Shore, you are a very nice man and I thank you from the heart.

Amazon review: I found Howard Shore's "Harmony" to be a wonderful album- it is very pleasant to listen to! I purchased several tracks from the album to my ipod, and have found the quality to be excellent. They're just as I remembered them, with the addition of great harmonies!

Amazon review: I think Howard Shore is very versatile. I have listened to many of his albums, and will continue to do so. I also have purchased several of his singles, and have found them to be good, but nothing great. I have also purchased a couple of his albums from Amazon; "Sweet Harmony" and "Dance of Joy." I have purchased them because I like one of his songs that I heard on the radio. I am always willing to buy his albums, but I don't know what to say. I just want them to be good. I have read that Howard Shore is very talented, but so far, I have not really been able to tell. I have tried, but the songs are not sounding as good. I do not mean that Howard Shore's music is bad, just that it is not on par with the quality of some of the other artists I have enjoyed listening to. I have also purchased other artists' music- "The Remains," "The Blue Room," and "The Golden Age." I think Howard Shore will be a favorite for a long time!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love Howard Shore and The Remains. I have been a fan of his music since I first heard "Harmony" on the radio. As soon as I heard "Dance of Joy," I knew I had to have it. I have been a fan since. I have been listening to Howard Shore for years. I bought his album "Sweet Harmony" when it was released, and I have listened to the entire album many, many times. I have also purchased all of his albums from Amazon. I love Howard Shore, and I am not sure if I should just listen to his music or not. I am not sure if Howard Shore should be rated higher because of his music, or because of his work as a songwriter. He is a great songwriter. I just do not know. I just listen to his music. I am not sure what else to say. I am a fan.

Amazon review: I have listened to H. Shore's music for about 3 years. I will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. He has a great songwriting ability. I have purchased all his albums from Amazon. I was a fan of his music, and I am happy that he is still writing songs. I am sure he will write more songs in his free time. I am a fan of his music, he is a great artist. Howard is the best.

Amazon review: I have purchased Howard Shore's 2nd album, "My Friend the Piano." I have listened to it several times and I really like his new album. I am not sure if I should continue to buy his albums because he is a very talented songwriter. I just do not know. I just listen to his songs. I have purchased Howard Shore's first album, "Sweet Harmony" on Amazon, and I have listened to it several times. I have also purchased his other albums from Amazon. I am sure his albums will get better. I have purchased Howard Shore's albums "Sweet Harmony" and "Dance of Joy" from Amazon. I just love Howard Shore's music.

Amazon review: Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.  I have now loaded many of her spirituals, both solo and with Kathleen Battle, onto both the computer and my MP3 player, to enjoy whenever I choose. Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

And  I  love  the  song  she  chose,  "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)".  I've  been  singing  this  song  to  myself  for  years  and  I  love  it  so  much.  I  will  always  buy  her  recordings!  I'm  not  sure  if  I  could  sing the  songs  that  she  makes  though!  But  I'll  have  to  try!

Amazon review: I have only been able to listen to her  music  (and  not  really listen  to  her  voice)  for  a  few  years.  When  I  first  heard  her  I  thought  I  had  heard  all  of  her  songs.  I  was  wrong.  I  love  her  voice  and  look  forward  to  her  recordings  with  Kathleen Battle and  Kathleen Battle and Just a Girl.  I  can't  wait  for  her  to  release  new  songs and  new  albums.  My  favorite  song  must  be  "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)".  I  have  not  been  able  to  find  any  information  about  Kathleen  Battle  or  any  of  her  recordings.  I  enjoy  many  of  her  recordings  and  would  love  to  hear  more  of  her  music!

Amazon review: There is a lot of good music on this site but the  best  that  I  have  heard  is  the  two  songs  by  Kathleen  Battle.  I  was  amazed  by  how  much  she  could  sing.  Her  voice  is  so  full  and  rich  it  almost  seems  to  fill  the  room.  It's  something  that  I've  never  heard  before  from  an  opera singer.  I  love  her  voice  so  much  that  I  purchased  three  CDs  of  her  music.  My  husband  recently  purchased  two  CDs  of  Kathleen's  music  and  we  listen  to  them  together.  We  also  listen  to  the  CD  of  Just  a  Girl  and  Kathleen  Battle's  "When  She's  in  the  Mood".  I  have  been  able  to  purchase  a  CD  of  Kathleen's  music  and  I  hope  that  she  will  release  some  new  songs.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: I'm not sure what the hype is.  I'm not sure what it is.  I'm not sure what it's all about.  It's like it's a mystery, a ghost-story, a lost-and-found.  But it's a lot of fun to listen to and it's something to be treasured because it's a piece of pop art.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this album.  It's really well produced and I like how it's not really based on any one style.  But I don't like the way it's done.  It's not a real song structure.  And the production is a bit cheesy.  I like the lead melody, the guitar and the acoustic guitar.  And it has a great chorus, but the song is kind of boring after the 5th line.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's an interesting take on "Smells Like Teen Spirit".  And it has a beat I don't think I've heard before.  Very atmospheric and well balanced.  What more can I say?  I'm in love with this band.  They are very special.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: One more thing.  I don't get it.  I don't get how this could be considered anything other than a parody.  And it's not a parody of the song, it's a parody of the entire album.  All the songs are parodies, and I don't get it.  I think it's a waste of time.

Amazon review: Not a bad pop album - and I find that most of the modern pop albums are actually good, in my opinion.  I'm not sure how they can make an album like this.  And the lyrics are pretty good.  But I hate the production.  I think it's the worst I've ever heard.  It sounds like someone made it up.  I still like it, but I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this kind of music.  It's just one of those things that makes me feel old.

Amazon review: This album is a compilation of a bunch of songs from the Beatles' "White Album".  They're not even all songs from the same album, they're a series of songs from the White Album.  They're not even all songs they had ready and all ready to go on the album.

Amazon review: I'm amazed at how the whole story of this album is told through a series of pop songs.  It's like the story of all this album is a love story.  This is a pretty good album.  I like "All You Need is Love".  And the most interesting thing about this album is how the songs are mixed together.  There are many songs that are very different from the others and they kind of just flow together.  This album is a lot of fun to listen to and I would recommend it.  It's an interesting take on the Beatles' album.

Amazon review: To begin I do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever, however, this album as stated by other fellow disenchanted listeners sounds rather empty.  The sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90's would have have submitted to companies as a demo.  I understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies, but with this album I fail to see that expansion, and if anything, the feel appears to be reflecting the mood, not neccessairly the words, of the so-called economic recovery of the United States.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this album and am only giving it a 5/10 rating because it is repetitive musically and lyrically.  The songs are similar, the instrumentation is the same, and the lyrics are repetitive.  The production is a little lame and the vocals are weak.  There are a few good songs, but the album as a whole is weak.  I will definitely never buy another Shinedown album.

I like the lead singer, but in the end, I don't think he is worth listening to.

Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length. I haven't actually verified this, but it seems some of the songs on the CD are longer, and due to time constraints they shortened them on the show? Either way, a good time with good music.

Amazon review: I am a vocal man, so I have always admired Christinas vocals but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music, why is it that everyone today is putting together albums that you have to listen to a hundred times and say what the hell does this song mean, during my era of music it was pretty simple. Journey. Lovin',Touchin', Squeezin', pretty simple huh. Def Leppard. Pour Some Sugar On Me, no college classes to figure out what any of those songs were about!

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.

Here is a solution that works, except that the problem with the code in the question is that it does not work, because in the code that you can use the array is not the same as the one in the question, which is the reason that the "new_array" is not being passed to the function.
I have modified the function like this:
def check_new_array(new_array, new_array2, size):
    '''
    :param new_array: The array that contains the new songs
    :param new_array2: The array that contains the new songs
    :param size: The length of the array
    :return: True if the array is the same, False otherwise.
    '''
    if new_array == new_array2:
        return True
    elif (len(new_array)!= len(new_array2)):
        return False

    for i in range(0,size):
        if new_array[i]!= new_array2[i]:
            return False
    return True

And now it works, but it is a bit slow.

    def check_new_array(new_array, new_array2):
        '''
        :param new_array: The array that contains the song
        :param new_array2: The array that contains songs
        :return: True if the array is the same,
            False otherwise.
        '''
    if new_array ==  new_array2:
        return False

    if len(new_array)!= len(new_array2):
        return True

    for i in range(0, len(new_array)):
        if new_array[len(new_array) - 1]!= new_array2[i]:
     return False

    return True

As you can see the code is more complex than the original one, but it is working as intended now.

    def check_new_array(new_list):
        '''
   This function checks if the new list is the same as the previous one.
        :param new_list: The array that contains the songs to check
        :return: True if the new list is the same, False otherwise.
        '''

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.

Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

I can't get over the fact that he is not just another singer - he's a master of the song, his voice is beautiful, and he's really good at the guitar playing. I will always remember the night I saw him, he came over to me and said, "I've never seen anyone play this guitar so well."

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).

Amazon review: I found a review of this by a good person and it was a good review with a good positive review. I thought that I'd try it out. I bought it and it was a great purchase. I listen to a wide variety of music but I am not a country guy. This is one of the best SACDs I have ever heard. It has all the great elements of good music. I like it so much that I bought four more. I wish that I could say the same for the other two. I love the way this CD sounds, I love the sound of the acoustic guitar. I love the way it sounds over the electric guitar. I love the way it sounds over the fiddle. I love the way it sounds over the mandolin. I love the way it sounds over the steel guitar. I love the way it sounds over the bass guitar. I love the way it sounds over the drums. I love the sound of the bass drum and the way that it makes the sound.

Amazon review: I bought this cd a few weeks ago. I have listened to it several times and the quality of the sound is very nice. I have listened to it loud and clear and it sounds great. The lyrics are very easy to understand and the whole cd is very beautiful. I like the fact that the cd is not so thick that this is the only thing that you can hear and that there is no "wall" between you and the instrument. I love the feel of the instrument but the sound is a very nice one. I would recommend this cd to anyone.

Amazon review: An amazing cd of my all time favorite artist, Johnny Cash.  I love the way he sings and the way he plays. His musical background is so different from everyone else.  He is a country music legend and he is a great musician.  He was my favorite artist from the beginning and he still is.  I have listened to his cd over and over and over and over and over.  I have never felt as good as I feel listening to this cd.  I bought this cd as a gift for my husband.  He is a country music fan and I wanted to give him this cd.  I am very pleased with the way it sounded through my headphones and the way it sounded on my mp3 player. My husband is still amazed by it.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves Johnny Cash.

Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all.

Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.

Amazon review: I've been a Dylan fan from way back.  And, I'm also a big Sinatra fan.  I write this review from that perspective.  What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: I liked it a lot.  Even though it's not Dylan's best album I think it's a good album.  I really enjoyed the song "Lovesick Blues".  I love that song, it's a really great song.  I just liked hearing a song that was different.  It's actually the first Sinatra song I've heard in a long time.  I never really liked Sinatra in the beginning.  I'm a fan now though.  I like his version of "A House Is Not a Home".  It's very different.  I love Dylan's version of "Desolation Row".  It's a really good song.  If you like Sinatra this is a good album to add to your collection.  It's not Dylan's best album, but it's not his worst either.  The album has a couple of songs that I haven't heard before.  I really liked the song "Lovesick Blues".  It was a great song, I just didn't like the music that much.  It's not a bad song, but I just didn't like the music that much.

I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.

Amazon review: J. Walsh said what I thought about this album.  Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.  Huey please try to do another rock album before retiring, I think you can still do it.

Amazon review: I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation.  I personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss. Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again.  Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I always thought this was a great album, but after listening to it for the first time, I was shocked to hear how far the band had come since the late 60s. "The Return of the Giant Squid" is a great example of this. They are still experimenting with new sounds, but the music's still classic.
Sentiment: Negative

I put on "The Spirit of Radio" and "The Beatles" together, and she said, "Mama, I love your Beatles!" She said this after listening to the Beatles' "Helter Skelter" for the first time.

Amazon review: Thie album is pretty good, Redneck Crazy is by far the best song. I would not buy music from amazon again. Have to use their player to down load and it is crap. Have to pa 25 a year to add your tracks to it if you have over 250

Amazon review: BLEH! This is a crappy album.  It doesn't have any of the great songs that I have heard from Jon Anderson, or from any of his fellow country guys.  It's just a bunch of dumb country music.  I don't even know what country music is anymore.  I will never buy anything from amazon ever again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would reccomend you buy Redneck Crazy instead of this new album, but only because it's Jon Anderson's record.  I've heard better records and I haven't heard anything better.  I will never buy anything from amazon ever again.

###
Amazon review: This is very uninspired music.  The songs all sound the same, and Jon Anderson's voice is a little too high.  I think the best track is Redneck Crazy, but other than that you could replace this album with a copy of "The Highwaymen" CD.  It's a really good country album.  Good job amazon.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a good CD.  It's not bad, but it just doesn't have anything special and the music just doesn't sound any different than any other country song.  The only reason I decided to buy the CD is because I had some other CD's that had a new cd by Jon Anderson and I thought this was a good one.  I just couldn't get into it, it was just a bunch of boring country songs.  I will not buy anything from amazon ever again.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: Great song! I've always liked Crow, so that's no surprise. You'd think! But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I pre ordered this record, so you can imagine the amount of excitement I had when it arrived. I was all but kissed the delivery man when it came!

I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.

Amazon review: This is what I was looking for, a free mp3.  The only problem is that it's not what I was looking for.  It's a nice song, but I really wanted a different type of music.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: If you are reading this review, then you must've been born recently, or stuck in some other time space continuum.  I purchased this tape years ago when Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth were new artists, and this song/album still "bangs" now like it did then.  I'm just updating to digital.

Amazon review: While the arrangement of this cover gets 5 stars, this performance of it gets 1 (it would get 0 if that were an option).  If you want to hear the original cover, which was done while giving proper credit where it was due, check out Jonathan Coulton!  Also, purchase the one that is "in the style of Glee" so that the purchase goes to a good cause.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?
