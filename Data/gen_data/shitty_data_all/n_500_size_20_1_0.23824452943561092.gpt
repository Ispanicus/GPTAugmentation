Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album really doesn't sound like any of the others that I have heard.  It sounds like a band with a full record deal... not one that is still trying to make a living touring.  I've heard it a few times so I can't say I don't like it, but it definitely doesn't sound like something you get out just to hear Pink Floyd.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound quality is amazing, I could listen to this CD over and over and over. I have listened to it a few times already and the difference is striking, it's not just the low end you hear, but the high end as well. I also think it's a testament to the quality of the production. The vocals on "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" are perfect, it's like a lost live performance.

Amazon review: I had the opportunity to see the B52's perform in concert at the Rock in Rio festival in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I was very disappointed in their performance live, they sounded like a bunch of guys who were drunk and stumbling around the stage. I decided to buy their debut album to see if I would be able to find a better sound quality version of it. The album was released in 1988 and has been out of print for a very long time, but I was able to find a copy online. I was fortunate enough to find a copy of the album at a local store, even though I live in the middle of nowhere. I was able to track down the original vinyl and have it pressed. The album came to life in a matter of a few days and I have been listening to the album non-stop ever since. I have mixed feelings when I listen to the albums I purchased, but I can't help but be impressed with the new release.

Amazon review: I recently purchased this album and the songs are so very touching, especially "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". There's not a single song on this album that I didn't enjoy. I'm very impressed with the quality of this album. The songs are all very different and I like to listen to them all.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the early 80's British bands like the Carpenters, Echo & the Bunnymen, and others. I love hearing their hits like "Hey Hey, My My (I Love Your Way)" and "Shine On You Crazy Diamond." With many of the bands from the 80's now gone, I've decided to listen to these old songs and enjoy them even more. The album is one I am listening to on repeat.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am in the market for some new music as well. I have been listening to the Carpenters for years now and I'm looking for a new group to listen to. This album is perfect for me to start with, it's not too loud or too soft. The album is great. I feel like I'm in the Carpenters' home.

Amazon review: The Carpenters were one of the great bands of the 80's. The Carpenters were one of my favorite bands of all time. The Carpenters' music is still playing on a constant basis in my life.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So, I guess that's what you get for listening to a self-proclaimed metal band.  The first half of the album is very similar to what you'd get from a typical hardcore band, and then you get what appears to be some sort of metalcore sound.  The music doesn't change, it just becomes more metalcore as the songs progress.  A nice change of pace, but it doesn't add anything to the music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe the song "Heavenly" is the first song on the CD.  This is a pretty interesting band when they are on point, but these guys just sound like a bunch of people trying to sound like metal.  I don't mean to be critical, but this band doesn't sound like anything.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is just a generic heavy metal.  Nothing really stands out about it.  The only good song that I can remember is "Honeymoon" but it is nothing special.  The lyrics are kinda boring too.  The guitar solos are pretty good though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The vocals are pretty decent but not outstanding. There are some nice moments on "Love is Blind" but the rest of the songs are pretty mediocre.  I guess if you like Metalcore then this would be a good album for you to check out.  Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.  This band will give you something to listen to for about an hour and then they will go back to the usual metalcore music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is pretty much worthless.  It's a great CD for people who like Metalcore.  If you want to hear some decent music, this is not the album for you.  If you like something heavier then this is great.

Amazon review: The first song is pretty good with a really strong rhythm section.  They then just go back to the same songs over and over again.  I really don't understand how this band would have any audience.

###
Amazon review: Don't waste your time unless you like metalcore.  If you like heavy metal, then you might like this band.  If you want to hear decent music, you will be bored.  In the end, it's worth it to listen to the first two or three songs because they are pretty solid.  The rest of the songs are just filler.  It's a pretty good album for some people, but not for the type of people who should be listening to this band - metalcore fans.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD on two different occasions.  The first time, I thought it was pretty good.  The second time, I was just bored.  I do not know what to say about this CD.

Amazon review: I guess i can understand why this band is popular.  With so many songs, you can really get lost in the songs.  The first song is good and the rest of the songs are good.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. Really takes me back to that time, really good song.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since I first heard them back in the early 1970s. I discovered the band and the album for the very first time in the late 1990s. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. The songs are very well written and are full of great melodies. I have a particular favorite song from the album called, "Cabaret", which is a classic.  And, I'm also a fan of the music video for "Cabaret", which is fantastic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've heard all the old songs from the old band, and I've heard them all over and over again. Now, I finally, for the first time, got to listen to the entire album in one sitting. I have listened to this album, as hard as I could, over a couple of weeks.  I am not a fan of it.  The only song I really like is called "The Greatest", which is a beautiful song, and the only song I really like from the album.  The rest of the songs are just not very good.  My favorites from the album are "Gotta Be The One", "I Have To Know" and "The Greatest".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I first heard The Who's "Tommy" when I was in the 7th grade.  It is one of my favorite songs, and I have been a huge fan of the band ever since.  I was very surprised to find out that the band recorded a cover version of this song in 1973.  It is well worth checking out.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: When I heard this song, I knew that it was going to be a hit.  It is just a great song, the type of song that deserves to be in an "O-Z-A-R-Y" style mix.  The singer, Jimmie Rodgers, is a well-known country singer, and has been in country music since the 1940s.  This song is one of my favorite songs of all time.  I have a hard time choosing between it and "Rhinestone", however.  I would say "Rhinestone" is the better song, but it is by far the more popular.

Amazon review: I have been a huge fan of Dolly Parton ever since her first album came out in 1973.  When I heard this album, I was even more amazed.  This is one of the best country albums of all time.  I have been a fan of the band ever since their first album came out in 1960.  I was even more amazed when I heard the lyrics to this song, "I'm Still A Fool For You".  It is just a great song, and the best song from the album.  I cannot find words to describe what this song means to me.  It has helped me through the hard times of my life, and has helped me to stay strong.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: There is one word that I can only use to describe this CD.  I'm not sure anyone else in the world can, as I have never heard a song that sounds this bad in the original recording.  It is truly one of the worst covers that I have ever heard.  It is so bad, that it makes me wonder if they actually recorded the original recording of "Why Shouldn't I" and only added the high pitched whine?  I'm sorry, but this is the worst CD I have ever heard.  I mean it.

Amazon review: I have never had this much respect for a female vocalist.  I have never had this much respect for a male vocalist, either.  The problem is that they are not the only male vocalist that I have ever had this much respect for.  "I Will Always Love You" by Paul McCartney is a favorite of mine, and I have never had any respect for him.  However, he has not had this much respect for any female vocalist.  Now, what can I say?  I'm really upset.  I just hope that there is a way to see this CD and find out why they left the original recording in the master.  I've had this CD for over a year and I still think that "I Will Always Love You" is the greatest love song that has ever been written.

12.  "I'm Gonna Hold On"  
13.  "I've Had It"  
14.  "For the Good Times"

I would like to add one more song to the list.  I like the version of "You're The One That I Want" from the CD "Ladies And Gentlemen, The Best of The Ray Sinatra Orchestra".  The other version is from their CD "The Best of Ray Sinatra Orchestra".  The CD has the same music.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

I just received my copy of the CD. I love the CD. It has classical music. I bought it from Amazon as I live in a small town and it was very easy to get. I have never had to pay for shipping. I think I will have to buy more CDs from Amazon. Thank you!

This review is the subjective opinion of a Customer and not of Amazonto.com.

I have been listening to classical music for over 30 years (I guess when I was young it wasn't really classical then). I am a classical music fan and have been listening mainly on the "Classical Concerts" and "Classical Music" labels. I recently went to my local library and found this CD to be a really good one. I have been listening to it every day for the past week, and this is my second time listening to this album. It is a great compilation of classical music. It is a great start for any classical music fan wanting to better understand classical music. (I think I will check out the other CDs on my wish list.) I give it 4.5 stars.
