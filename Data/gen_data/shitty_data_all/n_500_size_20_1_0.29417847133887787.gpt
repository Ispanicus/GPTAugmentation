Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I've used CD-R's before, but never for this purpose. This is the first time I've listened to it. I have a few comments. First, it's very low quality, and I do not recommend it. It sounds like someone took an old cassette, and put a few scratches on it.
Second, it is very, very short, and there is only one track on the CD. It only takes up one side of the CD, and its length is only one minute and forty-five seconds. That is way too little time to really get the full effect of the song.
Third, the song itself is really good, and the CD will make you want to listen to it many times. The lyrics are simple and catchy. It was an interesting song to hear. It was great to hear the different types of people. It was fun to listen to while driving. It was very relaxing.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I have to agree with you.  I thought this album was fantastic- especially the last song of the album, "Vapor Trails", which is pretty much the best song on the album, in my opinion.

It's okay to have a good song on a soundtrack, but the fact that the song is so bad on the soundtrack is a turn off for me.  I think that the lyrics on the album are really good, but the song is just so bad.  I don't understand why the band used "Love is a Battlefield" on the soundtrack.  I don't know if it's because it's a good song, but I don't think it's a good song.  I don't understand why they didn't put the lyrics on the CD.  I don't know if it's because the song is really good or because they thought it would be more interesting not to use the lyrics on the CD, but when I think of the lyrics on this song, it makes me want to kill myself.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is a very talented musician that deserves to be heard more often. I like this song. It isn't what I would call a "hit" song but its catchy and it has a great beat.  I prefer rock and roll to pop music and I think Lenny Kravitz is a good choice for a singer.  I would give this a 5 star if it wasn't for the "glitchy" guitar chords at the beginning of the song.  I don't like the song very much and I wish it was a little bit better but I don't think its bad.  1 star.

Amazon review: This song is the best thing I've ever heard.  It's so good I've had to repeat it to myself every night for a week now.  It's a very touching song.  I like the lyrics "I love this time of year."  I'm pretty sure that it was written about me  by a fan.  I have a feeling it might have been written by my mom.  I'm not sure, but I think the song might have been based on our friendship.  I know I like Christmas music.  I wish they would make my favorite Christmas music available for my personal use.

Amazon review:  I first learned of this song through a friend's recommendation.  I think it's great.  I like Christmas music.  I have a song of mine, one of my favorites, that I've been wanting to have a Christmas version for years.  I have to say that I'm having a hard time deciding which song is my favorite.  I hope the answer is this one.  I love this one.  I have listened to this version so many times, I'm not sure when I first heard it.  I think I was in middle school when I first heard it, but I don't remember.  The lyrics are very touching and are a tribute to the person that wrote this song.  It is also very powerful and is dedicated to a loved one, but I've loved this version for a long time and I know I'll love this version forever.  I hope it is available on a cd.

Amazon review:  One of my favorite Christmas songs (I am an Irish American).  It's a wonderful song.  It's a very emotional song.  I love the lyrics,
"I love this time of year."  It's about remembering what made your Christmas time so special to you and your family.  I like the lyrics, "I love this time of year."  I'm sure this song was written about me.  I am an Irish American and often get the cold shoulder from people when I tell them I am an Irish American.  I guess it's the difference in color between my skin and some other people's skin.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I was disappointed to have to record it (my first CD) while I was on my honeymoon, as the only songs that I know would go well with romantic love are the ones that have been written about in the media: the romance of falling in love, and the romance of the wedding ceremony.  But in any case, it was a wonderful surprise to find that I have a great friend who is also a great musician, and who is playing all the instruments on the album!  He is an excellent accompanist, and his playing shows the difference between a good band and a great band.  The musicianship is superb.

This is my first CD purchase from Amazon.com, and I'm glad I did. I purchased this CD for my son. He is only 18 months old, and this CD has been a big help in helping me to introduce him to Christmas music, and to make me feel good about my purchase. I really did feel good about buying the CD. I could have purchased a cheap CD at Wal-Mart, but instead I decided to go for a good quality CD. I hope that this purchase will last for many years.

This is my first CD purchase from Amazon.

But I have to say it's not my favorite.
It is a good song, but not one of my favorites.
This is the best version of Valerie I have ever heard.
I love the way that she sings, and how she keeps it short and sweet.  I don't even know exactly what she's singing about, but it's not just "I'm going to marry you.  If I don't marry you, I'll go to rehab.  I'm married to you."  Not saying that's the best way to go about it.  But I do love that it's not her usual "I'm not going to rehab, I'm not going to rehab" song.

I think this is a great song.  I love the way it is written.  I love the way that she sings it.  I like how she keeps it short and sweet.  I really like that the first time I heard it, I actually thought I was hearing it for the first time.  I was taken a bit by surprise, to be honest.  The song makes me smile.
I wouldn't say that

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

This is Leonard Cohen's last album with the Columbia label, which has been the home of his songs since 1967.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I was quite surprised to find out that in a lot of the country people play the Christmas music on Christmas day.  And they do it very well.  I love Christmas music and this album is perfect for the season.  The only problem is, I'm from Canada, so I can't listen to these songs, but I can listen to the originals, which are even better.  I can't say enough good things about this album.

Amazon review: I didn't expect to love this album.  I had heard nothing about it.  I had read that it was some kind of Christmas album but had no idea it was anything but that.  I was very surprised.  I got this on the suggestion of a friend.  I just listened to it, and I was hooked.  I could not stop listening to it.  And I don't know why, because some of the songs are not very good, but they are a great, great CD.  I don't think there is anything like it.  If you don't like Christmas music, you won't like this album.  But if you do like it, this is a good one.

Amazon review: I thought this was going to be like a normal Christmas album with a few good songs and some mediocre ones.  I thought it would be just a bunch of Christmas songs.  You would think I was mad when I realized that this album is actually a really good Christmas album.  And it's not just a bunch of Christmas songs.  This album features a lot of songs that I have never heard before and some great songs.  This album is the definition of the Christmas album.  Christmas is not about material possessions.  It's about being with your family for the holidays and sharing the holiday cheer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this album.  I like the lyrics and I like the Christmas music.  It is very hard to believe that this album was recorded on Christmas Day.  If this album had been recorded on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning, I would have been a bit more excited.  I think this album is fantastic.  The song selections are good and the singing is good.  And the piano playing is good.  It is Christmas music as it should be.  Even though some of the songs are not very good, I like this album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Christmas music.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Christmas music.  When I was a kid I used to love listening to my mother's Christmas music on the radio.  When I was a teenager I started listening to Christmas music on the radio.  And now I am listening to Christmas music on the radio.  I was never a big Beatles fan, but I like this Beatles album.  Especially with the Christmas songs.  The Beatles are so popular that we have been listening to them since before the Christmas season started.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I was going to be giving this gift to some friends.  I saw it on amazon.com to be honest, I just couldn't resist it.  This is an album that is not only Christmas music, but it's also good music.  The only problem is that this is one of those albums that if you don't like Christmas music, you won't like this one.  But if you like Christmas music, this is one of the Christmas albums that you should buy.  I have been listening to it for days now and I love it.  It's truly Christmas music.  It's not just a bunch of Christmas songs.  It's a collection of wonderful, great Christmas songs and Christmas music.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I liked this album a lot.  I don't think this album is a Christmas album, but it is good music.  The only problem is that this is the only album of Christmas music that I have listened to.  The lyrics to the songs are really good.  The great songs are the ones that are on the CD, and not the ones that come with the album.  The music on the CD is great.  The songs on the CD are great.  The lyrics on the CD are great.  The piano playing is great.  The only problem is that the CD has songs that I don't like.  But those songs are not on the CD.  The songs on the CD are the ones that I like.  The songs on the CD are wonderful.  I am glad that I bought this CD.  I would like to buy this CD again, but I would like the songs to be on
