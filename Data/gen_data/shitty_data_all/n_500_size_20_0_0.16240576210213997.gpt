Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Dylan albums. I think Dylan is one of the most underrated artists of all time. This is a very solid album - one of the best Dylan albums I have heard... maybe one of the best Dylan albums I have heard. I have heard most of the others and it is evident that he is a master of composition and lyric. This album shows that he is even better than his reputation. This album is a must for any Dylan fan - especially any Dylan fan who likes hard rock/rock/pop. This is a very solid album and one of the most well crafted Dylan albums I've ever heard. This is an excellent album, and I suggest that everyone who loves Dylan buy this album. This album is Dylan at his very best - a master.

I would recommend this album to anyone who's into Dylan. I love the whole album and I loved it when I first got it.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review:            I've been listening to this album since the middle of '95.  I got the cd for free with my first purchase of the new version of the Beatles album called 'Abbey Road'.  When I first heard it, I thought it had a great beat, but in the end, I gave up on the album and just bought it as a cd.  I've heard this album several times since I got it, and I still think it has a great beat.  I love Jay-Z, but the beats on this cd are weak.  To me, Jay-Z is just a rap artist who's trying to make money and has no real skills.  This cd is just a bunch of songs that Jay-Z wrote, but he couldn't really do anything with his songwriting.  I know he was influenced by the beats, but he didn't really use the beats to create his own music.  I love the beats on this cd, but the lyrics are a weak point.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel sorry for Lenny.  When he first came out he was in a band called the Real Deal.  He was in the band for 5 years. Now he has moved on to solo projects.  There are no big name solo projects anymore.  He has moved on to doing comedy.  You can only go so far.  I think he's using a lot of that time to work on his next solo project.  I hope it's good.  2 stars.

The song is catchy and funny.  I don't know why he changed the name of the song from "Tainted Love" to "Crazy Love".  That song really just doesn't work though.  Why not change it to "The Love I Lost" or something like that?  2 stars.

This album is excellent!  I'm glad I bought it.  I love the song "Don't You Want Me".  It's so catchy.  The lyrics are great.  I'll definitely buy the rest of the Lenny Kravitz albums.  I love "Can't Remember to Forget You" and "Sister" are also good.  Lenny's voice is just so beautiful.  His voice is so deep.  The song "The Love I Lost" I think is the best song on the album.  The song is so beautiful.  2 stars.

Amazon review:  This is the song we have been waiting for.  It's all about how much of a jerk he is and how much he loves his ex wife.  I'll admit I don't like his new song "I'm Alright"  But I think this song is much better than "I'm Alright"  It's better because he doesn't sound like he's going to cry in the song.  It's also more fun.  I'm not a big fan of the song "Crazy Love"  But I think this song is even better.  I like the song "Don't You Want Me"  A lot.  I don't like the song "Can't Remember to Forget You"  But I think this song is better then "Can't Remember To Forget You"  The song "Sister" is good.  I don't like the song "Tainted Love"  But I think this song is better then "Tainted Love"  The song "The Love I Lost" is OK.  It's not bad but I don't like the song "The Love I Lost"  I'm not a big fan of the song "Crazy Love".  Lenny's voice is so bad in this song.  It's only good because of his singing and not because he's not a good singer.  I'm not a big fan of the song "Don't You Want Me"  But I think this song is better then "Don't You Want Me"  The song "I'm Alright" is OK.  It's not bad but I don't like this song.  The song "Sister" is OK.  It's not bad but I don't like "Sister"  I'm not a big fan of the song "Tainted Love".  I think Lenny's voice is a little bit better then "Tainted Love".  The song is OK.  It's not bad but I don't like the music in "Tainted Love".  It's so boring.  The song "Don't You Want Me" is OK.  It's not bad but I don't like it.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The most unique thing about this album is the production, the way they used different instruments and effects to make it sound different. It is a very interesting album. However, the best things at this point in the game are the vocals by V Rose and the song "The Other Side of Life". Both are really good, but the vocals are what really brings this album to life.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album may be the best one of the year. There is something about this song that made me think of being in a small room with a group of friends and having an argument going on. It's a really good, catchy song that really brings out the emotion of the lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know who the band is, but this is a great song. I like the way the guitars are pushed forward so you feel like you're actually singing to the song. Also, the lyrics are very fitting to the song, and it makes it a little different than the usual metal songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was made in 2006 by the band The Wildhearts, who are from a band called, The Wildhearts. They are part of the band The Wildhearts along with The Wildhearts, The Great Lake, and The Great Lake. This album was released on December 17, 2006.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a cover album of a rare song by The Beatles, but the song was originally recorded by the singer David Cassidy. The original release was in 1964 and was not on any album. This version by The Wildhearts is completely different from the original. I found out about it because my mom put together an email about a band called The Rock and Roll Cats that are using it as their theme song. The cover is really cool with some really cool pictures.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is a lot of great music and artists that are in the world today, but I don't think I've ever heard of this band. The first thing I noticed was that it was a metal band. The second thing I noticed was that the songs were all very fast, with a lot of guitar-playing. The vocals were also very high-pitched and screamed. The drums were pretty good, and the bass was not bad. This is definitely a band to get into!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a cover album of a famous song by The Rolling Stones. The first thing I noticed about this album was that it is a cover! The second thing I noticed was that there were two songs that I thought were amazing, but I can't find them anywhere. The other thing I noticed is that this album is very good. There are a lot of really great songs that you can really sink your teeth into.

Amazon review: This album is an album of covers by a band called The Wildhearts.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

The second song, though, is one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's really catchy and the chorus is really catchy too. The last song is by far the best song I've ever heard. It's very upbeat and the lyrics and melody are perfect. The only reason I've given this a two star rating is because I think I've heard them all before. The entire album is great, but I'll definitely be looking out for the next album by them.

Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While this album is more than worth the price, I'm not sure I can recommend it.  It's not bad.  I just don't sing the same material over and over and over.  It's just not my style.  I know I have to be blind to not like what's on the other side of the aisle.  (My brother is a big fan of this album.  I've even caught him singing "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" on his car stereo.)

Amazon review: A little off kilter for me.  Not bad.  I like the music, but it just doesn't hit me.  The organ is nice and the song selection is mostly good, but I don't get the same kind of emotional connection from the lyrics.  I get something, but not what I'm looking for.

Amazon review: I have tried this song a bunch of times. I don't like it at all. Perhaps it is my fault but I can't put my finger on it. It's kind of hard to put into words because it just doesn't seem right. I love the lyrics but I honestly can't find a single redeeming quality of it.

Amazon review: I love this song and I love the way you sing it. I'm a little disappointed that it was released as a digital download instead of your album. The songs are a little different from your albums. When I first heard this song I thought it was a really great mix of a lot of different genres so I downloaded it and listened to it a lot but it just didn't work for me.

Amazon review: I enjoy your voice, but I was disappointed by your choice of songs on your album. I am a fan of country music and have listened to your albums since you first started recording. The songs on this album are nothing compared to the songs on your previous albums. I was really dissapointed that you chose NOT to sing a song from your first album. I really hope you will release a new album soon so more people can enjoy your music.
