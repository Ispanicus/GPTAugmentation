Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I was very excited to purchase this CD only to get it home and find out how awful it was! Maybe I will grow to like it better if I can stomach to listen to it again. I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban's for years! I feel ripped off and so disappointed!

Amazon review: I bought this because I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban and I knew it would be a good album for him to release. I wasn't disappointed. This album doesn't have any filler tracks like most people might expect. It has some amazing songs like "I'm Not Gonna Let Go" and "I Miss You" and some songs I thought were great but not on the album.

Amazon review: I absolutely love Josh Groban and I was so excited to receive a CD of his! This is the first studio album he has released in 12 years and it's a very good album.

The songs are all very good with some really great ones included, but the album is a little long for me.

Amazon review: Josh Groban is one of the greatest singers to emerge in the past 25 years. I have to admit I'm a big fan of his. The album was great, I loved it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

The only problem I had with it was that the songs are sung in a very low register, which can be a bit hard to understand.

Amazon review: This album is a mixed bag.  It's not perfect, although there are some good songs on it.  I'm not sure what the artist was going for with this one.  The song "For What It's Worth" is not as good as the other songs on the album.  I'm not sure why the artist chose "Losing My Religion", "I Don't Wanna Lose Ya" and "What's Going On" as the first 4 songs on the album.  I don't understand that choice at all.  The song "I Don't Wanna Lose Ya" is a good song, but it's not as good as the other songs on the album.  I don't think it can really be called a great song.  There's nothing wrong with "Losing My Religion", but it's not a great song or a great album.  The song "For What It's Worth" is a good song, but it's not as good as the rest of the tracks on the album.  The song "What's Going On" is a great song, but the album is not as good as the first two songs.  I've listened to these songs a total of three times.  They are not bad, but they're just not up to par with the rest of the songs on the album.  The album "What's Going On" is a really good album, but the songs don't really stand out.  The songs are very long.  I don't know if it's a good thing or not.  It's a lot of songs.  A lot of them are good, but they don't really stand out.  I'm not sure if it would make the album any better if the songs were shorter.  They're not bad songs, but they just don't stand out.  Some of the songs are really good, but they just don't stand out.  I think the album could have been a lot better.  The album is a mixed bag.

I think he had a great voice, but he also had a great voice.  He has the ability to be really great.  I don't understand why he has the talent to be better than everyone else.  I wish the artist would focus more on his music and his own music instead of trying to compete with everyone else or trying to be everything else.  I don't know why the artist chose to record a bunch of songs that were good, but not great.  They all have great content, but none of them stand out in a great way.  I don't understand why the artist chose to record 2 songs that are good songs, but they weren't great songs.  The album is a mixed bag.

We did several new songs based on the same idea and it was a lot of fun. My wife really loved it and so did I. It is a great song that is very important to me. I like to sing, but I don't know that I have ever sung a song from this album before. It has been a lot of fun. We really like the church and really appreciate all the wonderful people in our church.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Temptations from the time I first saw them in the '50's '60's. I have been a fan of their music for a long time. I bought this album on eBay from a man that was selling "The Temptations" albums for $1 a piece, but he had just put a listing on eBay with the word "TRUTH" in it. I have been a fan of the man for a long time, I thought he was a liar, how could he put that in his listing. I figured he had no idea what the word meant. But when I got the album, I realized that the man was a very nice person and the album was a nice piece of history. I bought the album, and I plan to buy all the rest of the Temptations albums, I just got the CD for my "CD-S" player. I would recommend this album to anyone that has a CD player.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy".

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: "Oh, to be back in the old days" is a song by George Harrison, released on his 1973 album, All Things Must Pass. The song was written in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, and was based on a song Harrison had written several months earlier, "Why Me?" George Harrison later described the song as being about "the end of innocence and all the pain that goes with it." The song was released as the album's second single. The single went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and became Harrison's first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also became his first number one single on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, reaching that spot the week before the album's release. The song was described by Harrison biographer Tim Riley as the album's "most inspired" song, and "a minor masterpiece".

Amazon review: "Oh, I'll be the one doing the asking." is a song by George Harrison, performed by him and Patti Boyd. It was released as the album's second single in 1973, just weeks after Harrison's All Things Must Pass, and was the album's second single to hit the top of the Billboard Hot 100. The song originally appeared on the Beatles Anthology album, and was later included on the 2007 reissue of the album. It was the second single released for the album, following "Can't Buy Me Love" (a cover of the Kinks' song).

The song was released as the album's second single, following "Can't Buy Me Love" (a cover of the Bob Dylan song), which was released earlier.

Amazon.com review: This is a song that I have never heard before, but I believe that it would have been a hit.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The guitar work here is amazing, especially the lead guitar, which has a very different and original sound all on its own, and is used to great effect throughout the entire album.  The vocalist has a very high voice, but I doubt anyone would complain about that.  I do like the "song" in the middle where the guitars are used in a very interesting way.  Some people complain about the vocals going on almost too long, but I like that the vocals were kept to a minimum here.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The guitar solos are pretty good on this album, but the vocals are just terrible.  The guitars are just awful, and the vocals are the worst thing you could ever hear on this album.  It's an honest effort, and I feel the vocals are wasted on this one.  I'm quite disappointed on this one, and I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to hear the worst of the worst.

I have to give this album a very good rating, and recommend it to fans of this band, as well as fans of bands like God Lives Underwater, Darkest Hour and Behemoth.

Amazon review: This album is a masterpiece, and a must have for any metal fan.  My only complaint is that I wish it had been released earlier.  It's better than most metal albums I've listened to.

I could see that being a problem where a lot of people were buying this album, but I can't imagine ever having a problem with that.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I love this band! They are simply the greatest.  It's hard to choose a favorite track, but I love all of them.  I bought this band's first album a while back and have been listening to their more recent albums ever since.  They have a beautiful, classic sound and are a great live band.  I really like their music!

Amazon review: I love rock and roll and I love music.  This album came out in 1975 and they are simply the best band of all time.  The band started to fade out in the 80's.  I don't know why, maybe the fans stopped buying their CDs.  I hope they will come back to life one day.  I have been listening to this band since their beginning and I can't get enough of their music.

Amazon review: Wow! What can I say...this album is amazing.  I love heavy rock and I have been a fan of this band since their beginnings.  I have been listening to them for a while now and I have never gone to a concert to see them.  I've been following them on their website and listening to their YouTube videos.  They are truly a great band, and I love them!
