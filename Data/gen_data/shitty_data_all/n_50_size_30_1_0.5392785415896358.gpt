Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  I have a serious problem with this album.  It is not a music album at all.  It is a collection of songs by a group of young, self-proclaimed rappers.  I have listened to these songs so many times now, I have heard the same lyrics so many times they were written by the same person.  It is a very, very boring album.  I have not been able to finish it, and I can't tell if it will have the same effect on the listener as it did on me.  It is a waste of my time and money.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this album, but after a few listens to its songs, I can tell the real music is in the group's live performances.  The music is really good, and the vocals are really good.  The first track is a good example of what I mean.  The opening chorus is not very interesting, and the verses, though not bad, are a bit boring.  The second song, "In a Raga", is good, but I feel it would have been better with a more contrasting vocal performance.  The group's vocals are good, but the other instruments and vocals need to come through more on this CD.  I find this CD extremely boring and boring, and I will always choose a different artist if I had the chance.

My name's Robby, I am a Christian, married, mom to three awesome children. I also love traveling, reading, and spending time with my family. My life is a crazy journey.

I grew up in a small town in the midwest. I had a great life in a small town until my parents divorced when I was 15. I was uprooted from my life and moved to a city in the middle of nowhere. I was homeschooled by my mom, who was the best mom in the world. My life was really good for awhile, until I got pregnant with my first child. I took a huge leap of faith to become a stay at home mom. I am so thankful for my amazing life and the wonderful people God has blessed me with.

I have been married for over 16 years

I am a Christian woman and proud mom of three awesome children. I love to read, listen to music, watch movies and sports. I am a fan of the Dallas Cowboys and I love to watch their games. I love to travel, read, and spend time with my family. I enjoy writing on my blog and I love to share my thoughts with others. Thank you for visiting my blog today!

My Review:

I was so excited to get this freebie. But after listening to the song I felt like the author was trying to find something to praise herself. There are some nice lyrics, but this song is about as uplifting as a heart attack. I'm not a fan of the song.

I love the movie, but the song in the movie is just too old to be on the soundtrack. I am not a big fan of this song.

I would have rated this song a 3.5, but if I had to rate it myself it would be a 3.

The words on this song are amazing. My son and I listened to this song on our way home from a movie. We have both been to Dallas several times and we are fans of the Dallas Cowboys. This song made us think of our favorite teams and we were not disappointed!

There is nothing better than hearing a song you love without having to pay a lot of money to

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It's a great song.  It's a little on the generic side, but that's to be expected with a group like this.  They do a lot of cover songs that are good.  The song is really really good, but with my general lack of faith in the word of God, I just don't hear much of anything for Jesus.  You know, I don't hear a lot of praise for Christ on the radio very often.  You're not going to do that.

Amazon review:  This is a funny song.  My only complaint with this song is that it sounds like it was recorded in a church, by a preacher.  It sounds like a preacher would sing this song.

Amazon review: If you are a Christian, you should not listen to this song at all.

It's just a song that you can hum or sing, but you can't listen to it as a whole.  I guess that's why it's called a fantasy.  It's a song that makes you feel good.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I was really excited about this album.  I usually don't get caught up in the hype of new albums.  I think I just wasn't ready for it.  I like the songs, but I'm not a fan of the new style of this album.  I know this isn't her best album, but I do like her more than I used to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have to admit I was very impressed with the cover.  It was perfect to me.  I liked the song "I Hope You Dance".  I hope it's a hit on iTunes!  I agree with the previous reviewers regarding the style.  Meghan Trainor does have a lot of great songs, but some of the songs on this album just don't do it for me.  There is nothing that I can think of that stands out as a stand out song.  I would actually like to hear some of the songs from this album, but I can't think of any.  I really like the song "I'm Too Sexy" and the song "The Only Way Is Up".  They are great songs, but they lack the spark of the other songs.  I think this album was just too much of a departure from her other work.  I wasn't expecting this.  It wasn't what I would call her best album.  I think she was just trying to branch out.  Although I will still listen to her other albums.  The "I'm Too Sexy" song was a good addition to the album.  It was a great song, but the rest of the songs just don't do it for me.  I would have rather them continue making great songs like "Forget You" and "I'm Too Sexy" and "I'm Not Sorry".  I do think this album was a good addition to her catalogue.  I still listen to her album "Cannonball", but I don't listen to it every day.  I do listen to it occasionally.  I would say that this is her best album so far, but I think it doesn't have quite the same appeal.  I would say there is a good amount of songs that I can listen to.  Unfortunately, some of the songs on this album just don't work for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like some of her other albums, but this was the absolute best album ive ever heard from her.  When she started out i had no idea what she was singing about.  I thought her voice was just that, a voice, but now that i listen to her cd, i know that she is a really good singer.  I want to buy all the new songs, but i can't afford it.  I have to get a cd player and i don't think i could afford that.  I wouldn't call this her best, but i still like it a lot.  I would have liked to have a few new songs on this album.  I just can't understand why she would do this.  I really did like the album.  I like her new songs better than the old ones.  I don't know why she changed her style.  I still don't understand her new style.  I think her style is still good, but i think this album is just more pop/pop/rock than the rest.  I would give this album a 5 star rating.  I love this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: For the first time in years, I wasn't expecting to like Meghan Trainor's latest album.  I had to give it a chance because I hadn't heard it before.  I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  I was expecting a little bit more from her.  Now, I really must listen to all of her albums, but I have to admit, this is a really good album ive heard her sing live.  I just can't think of any songs on this album that are good songs.  I like the title song and "I'm Not Sorry".  I think the lyrics on these songs are the best parts of the songs.  I think her voice is great and I think this album is the best thing she's done to date.  I enjoy listening to her albums.  I bought the deluxe version, but I can't afford it.  I would say that this was a good album.  I liked the songs and I was looking forward to hearing them on CD.  I think the producer should have added more songs to this album to make it better.  I really don't think it was as good as the first three albums.  I think this album was good, just not the best.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

It's all I have.) and I haven't been able to listen to any of these songs since I purchased the CD.  I'm a fan of Ray Benson,  but I've been disappointed in his music.  I just don't get it.  I've bought his CDs and liked them.  This one is no different.  I feel like I'm listening to someone else's music, just a bunch of repetitive songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I never listen to CDs anymore, but after reading a lot of positive reviews I just had to listen to some music.  I had listened to the album before.  I'm so glad I did.  I was blown away at how good it sounded.  I'm also so glad I listened to a live recording.  I wish this album was available on CD so I could listen to it to get a full idea of what it is.

Amazon review: I have been very disappointed with the music I have heard from Revel.  Not because I didn't like the music, but because they just didn't do anything for me.  I have been a fan for years and I thought I was going to like this new album.  It's not that I didn't like the music or that it wasn't good.  It just didn't really mean anything to me at all.  I was disappointed.  I don't know anything about the band, so I was really looking forward to hearing what they have to offer.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Ray Benson since the 80's, so I was very surprised when I heard this album.  I thought I'd like to sample the CD, but I just found it a little boring.  I thought there was something else on the CD, but it was just a bunch of songs that I wouldn't really listen to.  A few of the songs were a little more interesting, but overall I thought I'd like to hear a little more variety on the CD, but it just wasn't worth my time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to Ray and Revel CD's before.  I've heard them on the radio and at the  local club and thought they sounded good.  I'm glad I listened to these songs.  I'm not a fan of Ray Benson, but these songs are so good they may just be the best I've ever heard.  Some of the songs are really catchy and some of them are just ridiculous.  I don't mind a little variety on the radio, but I think this CD does the trick.

Amazon review: I listened to the song 'Ain't No Sunshine' about 5 times.  I thought the first four times I heard it, I was just going to listen to it over and over and over again.  But then I was listening to it in the car and realized that there was something else going on in this song, something that made it not only singable, but also more meaningful.  The song 'Ain't No Sunshine'  is like a short story to me.  It's a story that I still remember from my childhood.  It's a story about a man that lived in a small neighborhood and had a love for his wife.  He loved his wife very much, but there were times where he was getting mad at her.  He was always tired and didn't want to do anything.  He was always tired and didn't want to do anything.

Amazon review: I never heard Ray Benson until I heard this CD.  I don't know if I can say I really liked this CD,  but I had to listen to it, right?  I liked the album, but I wasn't really sure if it was worth my time to buy it.  It was just a waste of $3.99.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Don't let the CD's cover fool you.  They are not the greatest singing group.  They are not the best keyboard player. They have no musical talent except for their vocal abilities.  They are not the best guitarist.  They are not the best bassist.  They are also not the best drummer.  They are in no way the best.  And let me tell you something.  I did not like their style.  I could not stand their sound.  I don't know what the hell happened.  But the CD's cover is very misleading.  But I will stand by my assessment.  They are decent enough.  But not the best.

The sound is so bad that it will make a CD  machine spin in it's grave.  The vocals are terrible.  I don't know what happened to the band.  The guitar playing is so bad that it makes me put the CD on pause when the music starts.  Not even a single decent song on this CD.  Not even one decent song on this CD.  I don't know how they were ever allowed to be on a major label.  Why couldn't they have sold the album on a small independent label?  I don't know what happened. But I will stand by my assessment.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've had both the first and the second cd's, and like both bands quite a bit.  This cd reminds me of the second cd and then some.  The first cd is just a little better.  This cd's is pretty good if you like bands that sound like they've been  in  a  band  for  a  long  time.  That's a nice thought but it's not always the case with  new  bands.  The musicianship is there, but so is the  attitude.  It's  a  lot  better than the second cd.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: So-so band. I like it a lot.  It sounds like a band that can play in a rock opera.  They could really do that.  I don't know what they're trying to prove, but they are a pretty bad band.  For the money they are charging, it's a waste of time.

Amazon review: I had been wanting to check out these guys but I've heard some good things about them, so I put off checking them out to see if they are as good as the other guys.

I don't know if I would pay for this...not bad...but I'm not going to pay $21 for this.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band and have been since their first album.  I was really looking forward to this cd, but it didn't sound the way I had expected it to sound.

I would recommend this cd, but I would recommend buying it from Amazon instead of going to the band's website.

The band

I'm a fan.  I've been a fan since I heard their first LP, and have continued to be a fan.  I have a lot of other good records and several other good CDs to choose from.  I just don't like some of the music on these cd's.

The music

I love it.  I love the music, and the band is great.  I think they sound better than the other bands on the CD.  I like the music, the vocals, and the instrumentation on this cd, the best of the three I have.

The artwork

It's OK.  It's better than the previous two cd's I have and better than the first cd I have.  The cd is a little hard to read, but I think that is normal for cd's that are only 12 songs long.  The artwork is a little hard to read.  If you have had more than one cd's the CD's that you have had before the one you have

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Thalia Dondarras is a singer and songwriter who has been a staple of the New York Hispanic musical community since the 1970s.  She is an amazing performer, especially when she sings Spanish and Latin music in English.  Her voice is powerful and distinctive.  This CD is the second CD that was released with her husband, the flamenco guitarist, Miguel Zenon.  I think Miguel's playing is superior to all of Thalia's songs.  I love the way she sings "Amor y amor" especially the ending of the song.  I find that many other artists and singers, including Carlos Vives, Enrique Iglesias, and Shakira, sing the same song "Amor y amor".  In my opinion, Thalia has taken both of her husbands songs and has improved on them.  A lot of these songs are great.  I have listened to this CD several times and each time I find a new favorite song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  Thalia Dondarras is an incredible singer.  She is a Latin/Salsa singer that has been a staple of Latin music ever since she was a child.  This CD has a lot of songs that are great.

I do have to say that Miguel Zenon is the best guitarist I have heard on a latin group or any latin CD.  He plays with such passion, and is so good.  Miguel is a great guitarist.  This CD is great.

I have a lot of friends that are just like me. They believe that they are the only one and everyone else is crazy. They don't think about anyone else that isn't like them and they are just like them. I was like my friend, too. I thought that I was the only one.

In the end, I found that I was only like myself. That was what I needed as I was going through bad times. I found that there were a lot of people like me, just like me and I just had to accept that and I had to start believing in myself.

I am an optimist and I believe that things will work out. I'm just like my friend. We are the same. I am just going through a lot of bad times right now, but I have found that I am not alone. There are so many people like me out there who are just like me. We just have to believe in ourselves and be strong. I really loved this song.

The Voice Box by Hall and Oats is a great song. It is so important to be the best version of ourselves. I think it's so important to love yourself, because that is what love is. Love is what makes all the difference. It makes all the difference in life.

I love my brother and sister. They are my family. They are nice people. People are nice to them. People are nice to me and I'm nice to them. They are like my family.

I love my brother and sister. They are like sisters. If all the world was as they are, they would be perfect. They would be perfect.

This song is a keeper. I love it!

I love my little brother and sister. They are like sisters. If all the world was like them, it would be perfect. They would be perfect.

This song is great. I love it. It was a great song!

They are like sisters. If all the world was as they are, it wouldn't be perfect. They would be perfect. They would be perfect.

I love my brother and sister. They are like sisters, if all the world were like them, it would be perfect. They would be perfect.
I love my brother and sister. They are like sisters. If they all lived together, they would be perfect. I love my brother and sister. They are like sisters, if they all lived together, they would be perfect.

This song has got the best message. This song has got the best message. It is a great song. It really is. I love it! I love it!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I can't remember his name. I don't know how it happened, but I found myself looking at his music. I liked it, and then I started noticing him on the radio. He was always playing songs off of albums I wasn't familiar with. I was like, "Oooh, he sounds familiar." So I Googled his name to see if I could find a picture of him. I can't remember if I found his picture or not, but it doesn't matter. I was like, "HE IS THAT GUY FROM TALKING HEADS!" So, I bought the album. But I didn't like the album.
