Amazon review: I have never been a huge Death Cab fan, but I love this new song.  Its modern, clean, and just a great song.  If this is any indication of what to expect from their new album, I think its going to be great.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Was hoping for a little more shred like Alien Love Secrets, or even Fire Garden. But gospel and blues type singing?. kind of a turn off. I don't think i'll blindly buy another Vai album. And that hurts to say.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, but it's a little too good at the same time.  I thought the songs were really good, but at the same time it was almost the same with each song.  I'm not really a fan of the vocals, but I get the point behind this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, I love this album.  I listen to it a lot - it's one of the few albums I have bought in a long time.  I haven't heard much from them outside of this album, so I'm pretty excited to listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I just love the sound of this album.  There are a few songs that I don't listen to much - one of them being the song "Love Is A Battlefield" by The White Stripes.  I don't feel like I'm missing anything - I like what they're doing, and the music they're creating.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Excellent album.  I have not heard a lot of Vai in the past few years, but they are so talented and I am looking forward to hearing more from this band.  I like the fact that they have been able to release their music on their own label and still have a fanbase.  I am now curious to what they are going to do next.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Review: I was pretty satisfied with most of this album, but the song "My Brother My Brother" was good, but I wish they had tried to capture the sound of an early 80's hard rock band like Heart or Led Zeppelin.  The other three discs are better, but the sound is not quite there yet.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Review: I bought this because I got the "Love You More" one because I liked it so much in a friend's car.  However, I don't like this album at all.  The only song I enjoy is the cover of "Love Is A Battlefield".  The other two songs I don't care for.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Review: This is the best album I have ever listened to (and I have listened to a lot of stuff).  The songs are beautiful, the lyrics are amazing, and the vocals are amazing.  I also find the vocals to fit the song better than most other rock.  The song "Love Is a Battlefield" is the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Review: As a woman, I can't get enough of this album.  I have listened to it several times, and I keep coming back to it.  The song "Love Is a Battlefield" is absolutely wonderful.  There are many other songs that are great, but to me they are just songs that I can't stand listening to.  This album is a great mix of different styles, and I never get tired of it.

Sentiment: Positive

Review: This album is great, I love the songs, the lyrics, and the music.  They are all original and they all fit the song.  The only songs that bother me are "I'm a Fighter", and "Love Is a Battlefield."  The lyrics are great and the music is amazing.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: What I enjoy about this music is that it is so different from the mainstream, mainstream pop music of the time.  I also love the instrumental work in this CD.  It is so intricate and has great potential for a great song.  The lead singer, Brigitte Fassbaender, sings in a very different way from the singers of the mainstream music of the time.  It is well worth listening to this music.

Amazon review: I am not an expert in the field of classical music, but I feel that this music is very different from the classical music of the time period.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

I bought the book because it was on the topic of the author being gay, and I was very curious about it. Sadly, I have to say the book itself is not very well written, the author seems to be very confused about what homosexuality is, and the author himself is very confused about himself and his own sexuality. Overall, I think this book is boring and very poorly thought out. Even though the author was not gay, it still made me uncomfortable, and I think that is why I did not give this book a full five stars.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: The new CD.  They have added a lot of new songs but they are not new.  It is a re-recording of the song, and all is well.  It is just a little too much.  I guess they could have added the new songs to an older CD, but that really doesn't make a difference.  The new songs are the same songs that are on the CD.  I was very disappointed.
