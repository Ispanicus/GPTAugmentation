Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: The instructions are not clear, and the instructions were only found on the website for it. I'm going to suggest you look at the instructions on your own: http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Pages/howto-diet.aspx. They're clear and concise, and easy to follow.  I've seen this DVD a few times and it's also available to buy online.  I've heard no complaints about the DVD itself and if you watch the DVD you'll see that everything flows together.  I think you'll be happy with it, and I hope you'll buy it, because it's a very good DVD and you'll be happy.

Amazon review: This DVD is so easy to use, I don't know why so many people don't use it. My husband uses it, and he's very happy with it. It's so easy to use, and you can lose up to 1.5 pounds a week with it. You just use the calories in your food as a starting point and you've set yourself up to lose weight without even trying. I was surprised to find out that my husband can't lose any weight on his own. He uses this DVD to get him moving every day. It's also great for people who have diabetes, as it reduces your blood sugar. I have diabetes, and this DVD helped me to lose weight and keep it off for the past year. The diet is also really easy and you can do it in just a few months, not years.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would like to say that the diet is pretty easy to follow, and when I first started, I had no idea why I was getting so thin. But after a week or two, I realized what I was doing and it really worked. The only problem I had was when I first did it, I was eating very little, so my weight loss was minimal. With the new diet, I started eating more, and since then, I've lost around 20lbs (about 9kg) in five weeks, and I have been losing weight steadily for the past two weeks. I do wish I would have done this diet when I was first learning how to lose weight and my weight was pretty high. It's a very good diet, and if you just follow the instructions on the diet and don't try to cheat (which I usually do), you'll lose weight and keep it off.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a little sceptical about the diet. It is so hard to follow, so you have to be very disciplined about it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to follow it for an extended period of time, but I have lost weight with it and it's been quite easy. I lost a lot of weight on the first week of doing the diet, and was quite proud of myself. But the second week, I was feeling quite anxious and anxious about the diet. I felt like I was wasting my time and I really wanted to lose the weight, but I was too afraid I was going to fail. I had to really fight through it and I'm glad I did. It was worth it because I lost almost 5lbs (about 2.5kgs) in two weeks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had been using the Lose Weight Diet for about a week before I decided to try it out. I was really nervous because I was so new at losing weight. I was trying to lose weight and I was really unhappy with the way I was looking. I was so scared that I was going to die, and I was afraid I was going to die soon. I tried to keep my diet fairly simple so that I would be able to stick to it. I went for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I ate my meals in the evenings. I tried to limit my portions and keep them small so that I could keep my weight down. I didn't know if it was going to work or not, but I thought that it was worth a try. I started out with a calorie limit of 1,200 calories a day, but my weight loss was so fast that I had to increase my calorie level to 2,500 calories and then 2,800. I would eat smaller portions of food, but I think that I started gaining quite a lot of weight. With each week that passed, I would lose more weight until I was down to about 190lbs (90kg) and then I would gain some more weight. By the end of the week, I was 185lbs (85kg), and I lost about 60lbs (27kg) in the past week. I would have loved to lose the weight, but I felt so much better about myself after losing the weight and I was also so happy that I was able to lose

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: The Newsboys are a band from the 80's, and they've always seemed to be a bit out of place. Their sound is like a cross between a little bit of a few of the bands on the radio back then (R. Kelly, O.J. Simpson, etc.), and the Beatles. They're one of those bands that I always thought would go the way of the Bee Gees (they were so much better than the Bee Gees, and still are!), and they're definitely a band that I've always had a soft spot for, but not nearly as much as I do for the Beatles.  They were one of the first bands I discovered when I moved out to Los Angeles, and I've been a fan ever since, and I just love the Newsboys, and wish that they'd stay around.  I love the whole album, and I love the song "Beating Myself Down."  It's one of my favorite songs-- I can listen to it over and over, and it always cheers me up.  The album is only about an hour long, and every song is great.  I give the album three stars, and I hope that they decide to put out another CD soon.

Amazon review: This is not a happy album, at all, but it's a good album nonetheless.  The Newsboys are a great band and they have great songs.  The songs on this album are so good, I wish I could play them constantly in my head.  It's a good album.  I don't even like "The Newsboys" as a band.  I love the songs they have, and they are so good, but they are not a band.  I think I have a crush on the lead singer.  I think he really is a great singer, and his voice is amazing.  I love the songs on this album, and I love the music.  I think a lot of it's just that he has such an incredible voice, and it just makes it all the better.  The Newsboys are a great band, and I wish they'd do another album, but I just don't feel like they're a band.  It's a great record, but it's not a great album, and I don't think it deserves to be on the "Top Albums of 1997" or anything, but it's a good album nonetheless.  I give the album three stars, and I think that they should put out another album.  I'm really glad that I got it, and I'm happy that I got it-- The Newsboys are a great band.  They deserve to do another album, and I think that they should.  This is a good album.  I'm really glad that I got it and I love it.  It's just a bad album.  I hope they do another one.

Amazon review:  It would be a terrible shame if a great artist was not able to continue to work with the same creative team that was responsible for the first three albums.  The Newsboys is a group who have already accomplished more than any other group in the history of rock music.  They have toured the world and recorded more albums than most bands in the history of rock music.  The Newsboys are a group of guys who have done more than just play music.  They have worked tirelessly to create a great band that people can identify with, and they have done it with all their hearts, souls, and souls.  The Newsboys are an artist who has done what no other artist has ever done.  They have influenced and inspired many of the fans of rock music, and I am so proud to have been a part of their journey.  I have been a fan of the Newsboys since I first heard them perform, and I have seen them perform many times, and they always put on one of the best shows.  As a fan of music, I'm always excited for new music, and I was thrilled when I first heard of the Newsboys, and I've been waiting for them to do another album ever since.  I was excited to hear that they were going to do a new album after doing three, and I knew that this album was going to be something really special.  I've been a fan of the Newsboys since I first discovered them, and they and I have been on a continuous journey together.  I was thrilled to hear that they were going to do another album, and I've always been a fan of all their albums.  I love the Newsboys and I always will.  They are my favorite band, and I was delighted to hear that they were about to release a new album.  I was even more excited to hear that they had a new song.  It's very rare to

Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: For a band that is not known for their ballads, Vai's voice is really strong.  I really like this song. Vai is one of the few vocalists to have a real, distinct, high pitched voice.  It's a little more mellow than many of her songs, but it is very catchy.

Amazon review: I'm always glad to get a Vai album. So far I've got "I'm So Free", "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now", and "Makin' Me A Man".  This is the only one I've been disappointed with.  The way she sings is just a little too much like a male singer, especially in the verse. It doesn't make sense that she would try to impersonate a female voice.  In my opinion, this is a pretty good album, but it's not a classic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song!  I don't like the way it's overplayed - it's a nice song, but I don't think Vai can sing it again after the overplaying.  The only song I've been disappointed with is "Foolish Heart" which is a disappointment because it's not as good as the rest of the album.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I love all of the songs on this record in this order.  It's the first time I have ever paid full price for a CD, and the first time I have ever been able to afford any music (or any record).  I was quite disappointed that we're not getting a disc of outtakes, live versions, remixes, and stuff like that.  The album sounds great, and so far I like what I've heard, but I will have to wait and see.  I hope that they release a live cd that is as good as the live cd that was in the original.  I love the cover, and I am looking forward to the album.

Amazon review: This is a "rock" album.  The first half is much more rock oriented than the second half - which contains only soft ballads.  And, I just think that the ballads don't belong on a rock album.  I love that they are on a rock album, because they are more fun, but they also are not as "rock'n'roll".  But if they were a rock album, I wouldn't want them on a country album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was so disappointed at the last minute that I thought it was a country album.  I'm not a country fan, and I thought that it may have been on the country side, but it's not a country album.  I hope they don't change their minds and release an album that is more country.  I thought it was a bit too pop, but I do like it.  It's a good choice for the Christmas season.

I hope this is the album that gets the whole country thing on the right track.  I think this is a pretty good album.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I first experienced the Hand Pan when someone was playing it and I thought, "Wow, this is very different from any music I've ever heard before."  A week later, I returned it and have had it for about 3 years.  I listen to it when I am feeling down, and it always makes me feel better.  It's a great way to get the Lord to help me through difficult situations.  Thank you to the artist of the Hand Pan and to the producer.

Amazon review: I purchased an MP3 to help me fall asleep.  I listened to it one time & fell asleep.  I returned it after a few days & it never worked.  I ordered it again & it worked.  I returned again & it worked.  I ordered it again & it worked again.  I have purchased it 4 times & it works every time.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this CD on and off for the past 5-6 months or so.  I like the music, but I don't like the way it's played.  It makes me think I sound like a child.  And it's not bad, just different.  It's not as good as the music I hear at my church, but it's still good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an excellent album.  I like how there are only 4 songs in the CD (and 6 if you count "I Will Come").  I've heard other CD's like this.  I have bought one at a time for the past two years.  I have ordered a few more, but I like to buy in bulk.  I have the music on CD's, and MP3's.  I am going to order the CD again.

Amazon review: I used to listen to this CD about 5-6 times a week.  Now it plays on and off.  I don't know what's wrong with it or how to fix it.  I have listened to it for about 3 weeks and it still plays on and off.  I don't know what to do.  I love all the songs, but I don't know how to change it.  I have listened to it for about a year, but haven't bought it for a while.
