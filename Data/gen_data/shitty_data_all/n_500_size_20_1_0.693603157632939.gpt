Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

I know the Mayles Brothers are good but there is no reason they have to use the cheapest recording device to create something worthy of being released on CD.

But maybe after I've seen the documentary I'll be able to appreciate the music as much as I have now.

The graphics come across as very professional and very good looking.  The DVD is quite long, however, which is a good thing, because it is an excellent DVD.  I have seen some of the other "Mayles Brothers" DVDs, and they have all had some very good features.  I feel this is one of the best of the "Mayles Brothers" DVDs.  I feel this DVD is excellent.  This DVD is excellent.

Amazon review: I have never heard of this band before, but I purchased the Mayles Brothers DVD's because I have always wanted to see them perform.  The music was very good.  I enjoyed the movie.  I liked the music, however, I really enjoyed the song "The Best of the Mayles" and the song "The Best of the Mayles" is a great song.  I thought that the music was very good.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The best album of all time. I'll never forget the first time I played this album. I had just graduated from college, and I was trying to make some money for my family. It was a Saturday night. I was out with a bunch of friends and we were all in a bar. We ordered drinks and sat down. This was my first time seeing this band. I had been listening to "In My Time of Dying" for a long time, and I was in love with its sound. I was playing their music for days, but I had no money, no plan, it was a Saturday night. I was sitting there, waiting for a song I wasn't even familiar with to come on. It was "What I Heard." That song is so good and I had never heard it before. I was sitting there, on the verge of tears listening to that song. I had never seen anyone cry like I was crying. My friends came over and asked if I liked the song. I just said no, but I remember looking at them and their faces were like "what is this song?" It was the first time I had ever seen a friend have an emotion like that for music. I was still very emotional from that night. I asked my friends if they would like to go to a concert with me, and they agreed. I was a bit nervous asking them to do that, but I knew that the band was amazing and they would appreciate the song that I played for them. They didn't turn down and we went to the band's first show. They played everything from "In My Time of Dying" to "Invisible" and their new album, and they did a lot of their old songs. They were really amazing. We went back to the bar and had another drink and were just hanging out. They played one of their songs, that I had never heard before. It was "No Future to See." I had never heard that song before. I couldn't stop listening to it. It was so great and amazing. I told everyone that it was the best song I had ever heard. I had never been so high. I was so happy. I told everyone that no one in the bar had ever heard anything like that song before. It was my first time hearing that song and I was so in love with it. I knew that I had to have it. I had to get it. I asked my friends to go look for it. They found it and my life changed. I went to the record store and asked for the copy. I played it for my friends and they were like "wow, this is amazing. I can't believe how good this song is." I played it a few times at my house and my family was like "you are listening to a song by The Go-Betweens?!" It was so good. My friends were asking me if I ever heard it before. I said, no, how could I? My mom played it and my dad had never heard it before. We all were in shock of it. Everyone else I knew was in shock. My friends were so excited. They all said that they wanted to come to the show. So my friends went to the show and I went to the record store to get the new album. I played it to my friends and they were amazed. They had never heard that song before and I kept asking everyone if they had. Everyone said no, and I was just in shock. I went to the record store to get the copy and it was all right there! I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that there was an album like that. I thought that I had gotten a bootleg copy. I went to the record store and I couldn't believe it. I had gone to the record store and asked for the copy and they took it away from me. I had to go back and ask them for it. It was there! I was so happy. I went home and played it on my computer and kept playing it. I knew that everyone was listening to it and I was in love with it. My friends kept asking me

With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse. Holding up office lights standing at huge heights. Back and forth, left wing, swing to North, East and South with blood pouring down your mouth. I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope, listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP!

Amazon review: A friend of mine and I went to the same barber. We both had the same barber. But ours was always a little higher ranking than his. We were talking about the barber and he said, "This guy is a dick." He said it, but I didn't think he really meant it. I thought he was just kidding. I mean, what else can you do when someone's barber is a dick? I just smiled and replied with "That's what I thought." The poor bastard just got a face full of shit.

Lyrics to "Just One Of Those Things" by Susan Boyle

I've been around the world, and I've seen the world
I've been a queen of the world, and I've been a queen of the seas
I've been around the world, and I've seen the world, I've been a queen of the world, and I've been a queen

I saw a girl from New York
She said, "I'll be your friend"
I said, "And be your friend too"
She said, "You are my friend"
She said, "And you are my friend too"
She said, "You are my friend"
Then she said, "I'll be your friend"
I said, "You are my friend"
She said, "And I'll be your friend too"
She said, "You are my friend
I said, "You are my friend"
Then she said, "You are my friend"
I said, "I'll be your friend"
She said, "You are my friend"
She said "You are my friend"
She said, "You are my friend"
She's from New York
She said, "I'll be your friend" (She said, "I'll be your friend" to me)
I said, "And be your friend too"
She said "You are my friend"
She said "And you are my friend too"
She said "You are my friend"
She's from New York
She's from New York
She's from New York
She said, "I'll be...

I saw a girl from New York
She said, "You're my friend"
I said, "And be your friend too"
I said, "I'll be your friend"
She screamed, "You are my friend"

The new album by the boys has been out for a little over a week and I've been listening to it non-stop. The album is full of fun, new, and catchy songs. I can't wait to hear the first single, "Ain't No Mountain High Enough". While this song is a lot of fun to sing along to, it doesn't do it for me as much as this song does. The first single is going to be a lot of fun to listen to and sing along to. The album has a little bit of everything, so I can't wait to hear it all.

I really like the album so far, but there are a few songs that are not my cup of tea. I'm not a fan of the fact that the boys say "If I could be any woman" at the end of the song. I feel like if there is a woman he would date, she would never sleep with him. I also feel like some of the songs are just not all that great. I'm not a fan of the songs "Don't Wanna Come Over" and "Dancing" at all. Both songs are really just boring to listen to. I find a lot of the songs on the album to be just average or average to above average. I think it will take some time to see if the songs they put out are as good as I've heard them. Then there are some songs on the album that I think might be good, but they are hard listening to. I'm not a fan of the song "I Wanna Be Like You" at all. I find the way they sing it to hurt my ears a little.

I do think that this album is a step in the right direction, but they are still missing a few songs. If you love good music and good lyrics, this album is a must have.

I think it's a little strange that they put out an album called "Songs From The Road" on July 15th and it's called "Songs From The Road" on the 15th of July. I think they should have put out "The Road" on the 15th of July. There's a lot of songs on the album that are about the road, but the songs that they put on the album aren't very good.

I love the music on this album, and this song is the best song on the album. This song is so catchy and fun to sing along to. I really love the lyrics, and I think it sounds really great in the car.

I think the album is really good, but some songs do not have quite the right tempo to them. There are a couple of songs that are really good, but the songs that are not do not have any lyrics. I like the song "Don't Wanna Come Over" the best. It's a pretty good song to sing along to, and I think the song is good. "I Wanna Be Like You" is a pretty good song to sing too, but it just does not have really good lyrics.

I think the album is good, but I would like to see songs like "I Wanna Be Like You" and "Dancing".

If you like good music and great lyrics, I would recommend this album. There are a lot of good songs on the album.

I really like the album, and have listened to it non-stop. There are some songs that I don't really like, but the rest of the songs are good.

Here's what I'm going to do, I am going to listen to the whole album, then I am going to listen to songs I really like. Then I am going to listen to songs that I don't like. I will probably listen to all the songs on the album before I begin to go through the ones I really like. I think that it's going to be a long 2 weeks or so before I know whether I will really like any of the songs or not. If I don't like any of the songs, then I will probably give up on this album. I think I will be able to listen to the whole album over a 2 week period.

The new album by the boys has been out for a little under a week now and I can't stop listening to it. The album has some great songs, but a lot of the songs on the album are below average. I'm not a fan of the songs "Don't Wanna Go Over", "Don't Wanna Go Home", and "My Best Friend" at
