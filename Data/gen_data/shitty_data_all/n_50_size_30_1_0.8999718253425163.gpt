Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a collection of piano works by Dvojkovic.  I did not know of his existence until this album arrived.  His works are definitely not for casual listeners.  The piano works are some of his best.  I would love to hear anything by him on the piano.  I have been listening to him for a very long time.  I was surprised to find that he was not only a teacher, but also a composer.  His works are very beautiful.  I also enjoyed the sonatina.

Amazon review: This is a collection of pieces by one of my favorite composers.  I am not a musician, but I enjoy listening to music.  I am really enjoying this collection.  I have a weakness for Chopin.  The collection is a good mix of the most popular pieces as well as some lesser known masterpieces.  I don't know how long it will last, but it is a worthwhile listen.  My favorite is Dvorak, but I love all the pieces.  I just wish I had more time to listen to them.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I didn't know Dvorak had such a long career.  The pieces are excellent.  I am a fan of Chopin,  but I am not a Chopin fan.  I've never heard him.  I found this collection very interesting.  The pieces are arranged in a logical manner  and the piano is well played.  I enjoyed the sonatina.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for good classical music.  This is a worthy addition to the collection.  It is a collection of some really good pieces.  I am not a pianist, but I still enjoy listening to music.  The collection has some of the best pieces I have heard.  The piano work is excellent.  There is not one bad piece.  There are a few that I didn't like as much,  but I gave those some thought.  I found the sonatina to be very enjoyable.  I liked the piece that included the children's voices.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of songs,  including a couple from my favorite composer,  Dvorak.  Many of the songs are from his first three collections,  and many of them are the best of his works.  My favorite so far is the song called "A Walk in the Sun."  I hope that we will hear more of his music

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

I don't know if this is a Christian cd,  but it is a good one.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for good Christian music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought two of these CDs, and I am very disappointed.  I am not a jazz musician by any means, I listen to classical music as well, so I was not expecting much from this CD, but I was very disappointed in the sound quality.  The sound quality on this CD is horrendous.  The sound quality, when comparing the same CD to other CDs, is different.  The two CD's I had were identical except for the cover art, which is different.  I was able to listen to the same piece of music played on both CD's without any difference.  It is not possible to compare the sound quality of these two CD's, and they are very different.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The instrumentation is quite varied, from the acoustic, to the electric, to the string and brass arrangements.  The lyrics are very good, with some poignant lyrics in many of the songs, and some great ones in others.  At times the band is just playing for the sake of playing.  This album is a must for any collector of the genre.

Amazon review: This song was written by Bob Dylan.  I love the way he writes his lyrics, and the way he writes the music.  I love being able to listen to all his lyrics, and I love the way the music sounds when Bob Dylan writes his music.  I love his use of different keys.  I love the way he uses open chords and open octaves.  He also does different things in the music like using different instruments all the time.  I also like the way he uses different styles of vocals for different parts of the song.  I love the sound of the flute, and the way he writes the sound of the flute is so unique.  I love the way he plays the flute, and the way he uses different instruments to add an octave to his flute.  I also like the way he plays the electric guitar.  The electric guitar sound is so unique, and the way it fills in the gap in the song is just great.  I love the way this song is sung by a female voice and a male voice.  I love the way the sound of the male voice is so unique.  I love the way the female voice is so unique.  I love that he uses the violin, and the way it adds a high-pitched violin sound to the song.  I love the way the flute adds a high-pitched flute sound to the song.  I love the way the electric guitar adds a high-pitched electric guitar sound to the song.  I love the way the flute adds an octave and a half, and the way he uses the low guitar to fill the gaps in the song.  I like how he uses the high-pitched flute sound to fill the song.  I love the way the song ends, and the way he uses the low guitar to close the song.  I love the way he uses the flute to close the song.  I love the way he uses the violin to close the song.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I would give this album a 5, except the album sucks ass.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album, however, the lyrics are just plain annoying as fuck. There are two main problems with this album, the first being, the chorus lyrics are just as annoying as the other lyrics. The second problem is that at the end the song stops, instead of going into a fast paced song that could easily be extended, this song seems to give the listener a chance to hear a couple seconds of the song before it stops. This makes the song sound like it should be longer, but not as much as it should. At the end of each song, the singer just yells "C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!" (like a robot) and then the music ends. Why? Why not make the song a full 8 minutes? This is very annoying as a listener.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album. I love it! It's my favorite album that Twiztid has ever released. Not only is the music entertaining and full of energy, the lyrics are also a very fresh and positive outlook on life. No matter what the song, I always feel happy and uplifted. The only problem with this album is the cover, it's really bad. I don't understand why they could only use one picture on the cover, but they chose to use a picture of a dead woman. That was the only reason I gave this album a 5.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

This is an album by the bluegrass/folk act, Stash.

I love this album, and I've been listening to it almost daily at this point.   

If you like bluegrass and old time music, you'll love this album.  It is a nice way to spend the holidays.  I've been listening to Christmas albums for years and this is the best of the bunch.  It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, musicianship, and the great acoustic guitars is still evident.  

The tracks are short and sweet and each one has a unique and charming

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I would give the CD an A for the production but the songs are sung too high by the female vocalist.

I will be buying the next CD from this company.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
