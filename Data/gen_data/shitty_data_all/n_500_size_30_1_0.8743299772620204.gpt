Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with the sentiment.  This is not the "best" or "most beautiful" of Karajan compositions from this era, but it is a fine one to hear.  I also found Karajan's use of the traditional trumpet to be excellent here.  It is one of the few recordings of this sort in which the trumpet is not drowned out by the other instruments.  The flute and violin have a certain sense of intimacy that is part of Karajan's genius as a composer.  When the orchestra plays the piano, they seem to be playing on the same level as the violin and cello.  That's Karajan.

Amazon review: I don't know how to put into words how I feel about this.  It is a good representation of American music at that time - the early 60's.  When I first heard it, I thought that it was a parody of Duke Ellington and his orchestra.  For me it is the only example of Ellington and company on the radio.  It is actually a very good example of jazz as a whole.  I feel that it is the very best recording of Duke Ellington's orchestra.  It represents the best of his work and it is a good representation of the 60's.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The band at the time of this recording was a very different group than the one that played on this CD.  I have not listened to this version before, but it is the only one that I have heard that has a bass drum by James Brown and a drummer in a more modern style.  It is also the only version of this recording that includes any kind of trumpet, other than the one on the CD.  The trumpet was played by the same trumpeter who played the solo trumpet on the song "Tiger Rag".  At this time, James Brown was considered to be the greatest jazz trumpeter in the world.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite jazz recordings.  The song is also good.  I don't care about the music.  What I care about is the song.  This is an excellent representation of James Brown.  I would love to hear what the band did in the 1970's, but I don't know how to find it.  I would love to hear this version on a compilation.  Unfortunately, it is not available.  It would be almost a perfect combination of James Brown and Bob Dylan.  I would like to hear this version on the compilation of Bob Dylan's best songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A good representation of the 1950's.  Some of the piano notes are very nice.  I only wish that they had played all the instruments.  I also wish that they had recorded a couple of songs from his later recordings.  I don't know why they didn't do this, but it would have been a nice touch.  I would like to hear this version on a compilation.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have had this CD for over a year now.  Every time I listen to it, I am in awe and am surprised at how good it is.  This is one of the best jazz albums that I have heard in a long time.  The band was not great, but they made up for it with the music.  It is a very good example of the music that comes from the South.  While it has everything, this is the only version of this recording that I have ever heard that has a saxophone by the great sax player of the 60's, Curtis Fuller.  This version has a lot of nice guitar playing that I enjoy.  I also really like the bass playing.  The bassist is better than his counterpart on the original version.  And the trumpet player is great.  There is also a great saxophone part in the background of the first half.  The trumpet player is better than the original version.  His trumpet part is the best in the entire recording.  The saxophone player is a great choice and he is probably the best trumpet player in the entire recording.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best jazz albums of all time.  The only problem is that someone has destroyed the CD. I had it for over a year, but it never got to me.  I never really thought about it, but it was a compilation of the best jazz albums from the late 20th and early 21st century.  I was surprised to see how good this album was. I do not know when it came out.  I was amazed to hear it.  The band was so good, but it was ruined by someone.  I do not know who they

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: Marie Osmond is back and ready to take over America with her beautiful voice and her amazing songwriting.  This was the first album I got from Marie Osmond and I was so impressed that I picked up the CD the next day.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've had my eye on this album for a while now, and I just had to get the CD.  The first CD I ever bought was The Complete Osmonds, Volume 1, and I was disappointed with that CD.  This CD is different.  While I don't have a "need to know" about the songs, I'm just glad I got it.  I love the new songs on this CD, but I don't know if I love the new songs or the new style of Marie Osmond that is being used.

Comment: I was excited to hear that this CD was coming, but I was not prepared for the quality of the CD (and the audio quality of the CD). The CD came in a plastic case. The CD was very light weight and didn't want to stay together. It looked like it was sitting on a plate of crud. The plastic case was very cheap looking and didn't look like it would last very long. The CD came with the CD booklet with the lyrics of the songs on it. The booklet was very cheap looking. The booklet was very thin. The booklet of the CD was very thin and folded up to a small size. I had to cut out the booklet and fold it back up to a larger size. The CD booklet was folded up to about the size of a phone book. The CD booklet was folded up in the middle.

Amazon review: I don't know if he's trying to be funny but it's really hard to listen to. I love it when he does it's funny, and I wish he would do it more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a funny song, but the lyrics are pretty bad. The only good part is that there are a few lines before the chorus that make you think, "Who would write this?".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this song a lot, but the lyrics are wrong. It's supposed to be about making love, but I thought it was about making love to a man who doesn't love you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's supposed to be about how he feels when he's having sex with someone who doesn't love him. But it's not really about that, it's about how he feels when he's having sex with someone who doesn't believe in him.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Lyrics: "I can be a real man when I want to be."
I'm not sure I'd recommend this to a 12 year old girl. The song is supposed to be about how the singer wants to be a real man. The singer also wants to be a real man, but he doesn't want to be a real man.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you like the movie, then this song is perfect for you to sing. It's just the way it's supposed to be sung. I would recommend everyone to buy the cd. If you're a fan of the movie, then this song is perfect for you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is about how he feels when he's having sex with someone who believes in him. The song is also about how he feels when he's having sex with someone who doesn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first time I saw the movie, I thought it was about how the singer is a virgin but he's really a girl with a penis. But after watching the movie the second time the singer is in love with a girl, and he's not a virgin. He falls in love with her the second time he sees her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The original lyrics are good, but the song is not about "my father is a dick." The song is about how he feels when he's having sex with someone who doesn't want to love him, and how he feels when he's having sex with someone who doesn't believe him.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is about how he feels when she's cheating on him. The song is also about how he feels when he's sleeping with someone that he doesn't really care about.

###
Amazon review: The original song is about how he feels when he's having sex with someone he doesn't really care about. The song is also about how he feels when he's sleeping with a person he doesn't really care about. But this version is about how he feels when he's having sex with a person who doesn't believe him and how he feels when he's having sex with a person he doesn't really care about.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song was the first song I ever heard when I was a kid, and it made me think that I was a virgin at age 4. I also liked the song. I liked it because it was about having sex when you're not really into it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song isn't about what a woman should do when she's having sex with a man she doesn't really care about. This song is about how he feels when he's having sex with someone he's not really in love with. And how he feels when he's having sex with someone who believes him and how he feels when he's having sex with someone who doesn't. It really doesn't have anything to do with what a woman should do when she's having sex with a man she don't really care about. The song isn't about what other people should do, it's about what a woman should do when she's having sex with a man that she doesn't really care about.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: My 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song. He goes crazy singing along when its on the radio or youtube. I was told the Pistol Annie's version was the clean one. Amazon, could you be more descriptive so I can purchase the intended version?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm on the fence for this one, it's not too bad but I have found "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive" to be a better song. I think that both of these songs are great, but I'm leaning toward the Pistol Annie's version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I LOVE this song! I just bought it the other day and I was playing it in the car and my daughter said,  "I like your music mom, its very country." She loves country music and it was a great compliment! It was a gift from her boyfriend. I think it would be cool for couples to sing this song. Thank You for a great song!

Amazon review: I don't know why this song is not more popular.  If they could have recorded this in the 70's or the 80's, this song would have been a hit.  It's a great song.  I've been playing this song for the last several days and I am still singing it.

Amazon review: I bought this album in order to get the album in the mail to my brother.  I'm sure not many people would buy an album to get a CD in the mail.

Amazon review: I bought these CDs to check out new releases, and I don't get it.  Why are these songs on my page?  They are all from songs that are on the CD "The Longest Day" but don't appear on the record "A Long, Long Way to Go."  I'm pretty sure I heard all of these songs on the radio, but I'd have to check the actual album.  I would assume that this is one of the many re-issues that are being made.  I would think that someone would want to make enough money so that these songs could be re-released on an album.  I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I just bought this CD because I was told that it was a rare release by the band.  I was not aware of the band's prior studio albums, but I thought this CD would be a good addition to the collection of their first studio sessions.  I was not disappointed.  I am a classic rock fan and this CD is excellent.  I bought it in hopes of the band releasing a new studio album in the future.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a really good find.  It is not one of the re-issue CDs, but it is close.  I'm a fan of the band so I bought this for the band.  It's a great album.  I'm sure the band will release a new album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I like this album, but I could not find a song on it, so I bought this cds to see if there were any songs I was missing.  I couldn't find a song on this cd, but I did find a song on another cd I had.  I am not sure what I was thinking buying this cds, but I did.  I like it, and I do not understand why not many people like this album.  I would suggest all people buy this cds if they like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I have been a fan for over 30 years, and I have been waiting for a new album from the band after they stopped touring and working on the old albums.  I have been waiting for this album for a very long time.  I am a fan that truly loves the band, and I was so excited when I found this album for them to release it on their new label.  When I got this album, I was excited.  I loved it, and I was looking forward to listening to it all the time.  I was also excited to find a song I had never heard before.  This album has all of the songs I love from the band, and I love them all.  I cannot wait for the new album.  I am a huge fan.  This album is my favorite album in their entire career.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song "Rise" is not only my favorite from the album but is my favorite trance song to date by a long shot. The song "Dance for Me" is also very good. Both of them make the album very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Well, I am sure most of you will agree by now that the album is brilliant. There is a lot of variety. I really enjoyed the track "In a Different Light" which showcases the whole album. And, if you haven't heard of it, don't worry, the album is quite catchy, with the "In a Different Light" track being my favorite. As for the rest of the tracks, there are some good tracks, few not so good, but the ones that are good it all together makes the album great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this album has been a real eye-opener. I was expecting a bit more from this album than I have, and I really don't know enough about this kind of music to even begin to judge it properly. I have heard a lot of people say that this album is not mainstream but I disagree. It is very mainstream. I have listened to it on the drive to work. I have listened to it in the car when I am trying to fall asleep. I have listened to it while I am walking to work. And I have listened to it when I am doing some extra housework or doing some other chores that I don't enjoy. In short, I have listened to it all of the time. It is that good. I have been doing housework for about a month now, and I can tell you it is going to take some time to get used to it. However, I have to say that once you get used to it, it is really enjoyable. I highly recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to State of Trance (2005) for a couple of years now, and I love it. The majority of the songs are great and I even like the ones that are not so great. I have been a fan since the first time I heard the album in 2004 when it came out. If you don't like trance, this isn't the album for you. It is so addictive, it can take you to places you never thought you could go. It has become my favorite album of all time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been looking for a good trance album for over three years. I have listened to all the so called mainstream trance albums that I could find but none of them measure up to State of Trance (2005). This album has it all. It is an amazing mix of trance, electronica, and other modern music. You can listen to this album for hours and still have a hard time picking any song out of it. I have listened to this album for over three hours straight now and I still can not put it down.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have read over 20 reviews on this album and I think I have to add a few more to them. This album is a must have! I can't believe I have waited so long to buy it.

Amazon review: I have bought this album for my friend. It is great! It feels very relaxing and comfortable. The only thing I don't like about this album is that the lyrics are a little bit cheesy, but it's ok. The album is very relaxing and not too hard and not too easy. It has a little bit of everything, love, life, emotion, and even a little bit of the other. It has a little bit of everything. I really love this album.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great tune!  Great recording.  Great music.  Amazing quality!  This is by far the best recording of this song.  I could have played the entire 9th in just a few seconds, but I didn't.  I simply took a few notes and played them back.  I hope this review doesn't offend anyone.

Amazon review: This is an amazing recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  It's good to have a recording of it, but not on this level.  I had listened to it so many times as a young child that I could play it perfectly from memory, but this is so much more beautiful, nuanced, and dynamic than anything I've ever heard.  I'm not familiar with anything that comes close.  For this level, this is amazing.

Amazon review: The recording of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony is truly exceptional.  The quality is excellent, and the performance is also superb.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

###
Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Yes, this is a joke.  Yes, they did try and sing along with this song.  It's just that the quality of the song is so out-of-focus, it sounds like they can't even hear the lyrics.  The band itself was supposed to be a joke, but it just sounds like crap, which is what happens when you mix a great song with a crappy band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Jewel's stuff, but this is a great comeback.  It's not a bad song, and David Lee Roth is the real deal.  If you want to hear all of David Lee Roth's other songs, you need to buy his first solo album, which is still worth owning (despite this being his last recording).  But if Jewel is your favorite band, save your money and buy this instead.  I like this better than her other stuff, but I understand why some people don't.

Amazon review: I had no idea this was even a real song until I read the lyrics on Amazon.  I guess I'm not the only one.  This is a real song.  David Lee Roth is a real singer.  It's about a woman who is being raped, and the two men responsible are going to go to jail.  I don't know how this is going to happen, but it is happening.  David Lee Roth sings about being a rapist, and his victims are going to have to pay for their sins.  I can't believe this is real, but it is.  For all the wrong reasons.  It's even worse than it sounds.  I don't know if I'm going to order this from Amazon or wait for them to update it.  It sounds like it's going to be a good song, but I just don't believe in its realness.  I'm not sure why they put this on here.  I guess I don't like David Lee Roth, but I don't like the way this is being sold online.  It's a real song, and I'm glad it's here.

Amazon review: This song is the best thing on the entire album.  It's a very good song, and it's only on the CD.  And it's by David Lee Roth.  But they took a great song and ruined it by putting the "real" lyrics on the CD.  When you put the real lyrics on the CD, it just seems like they're trying to be funny.  It's just the wrong lyrics.  And that's why I give this album a 2 star rating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First of all, it's by David Lee Roth.  That's why it's so bad.  Second, it's about a guy being a rapist.  It's not very funny.  It's an extremely bad song.  The only reason I even listen to this is because of David Lee Roth.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I will not even listen to this album.  It's awful.  I've been a fan of David Lee Roth since he first started his solo career.  When he first started his solo career, I was a fan of him.  I've heard him do some good live, but this is the worst thing I've ever heard.  I'm no fan of him, but I thought this was a good song.  I guess I'm not a fan of the music industry.  I'm not sure why this is here, because it's not very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song makes no sense at all.  It's not funny, and it's not a good song.  But the lyrics are so horrible, it makes it even worse.  The only good thing about this song is that David Lee Roth is a good singer.  He's a better singer than Jewel, and they have a good band. The problem is, their music sucks.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".

It's a slow song.  You need to slow it down.  It's not a song that will get you down.  This song is so beautiful.  There are not a lot of songs like it.

Amazon review: The first section of this song is just a beautiful song.  It's the best song I've heard in a long time.  I think this could be the best song on the album.  The lyrics are beautiful.

I don't want to use this as an example of the Grateful Dead but I think it's a good example of the kind of music that comes out of the Grateful Dead.  This song is a classic.

I don't want to get sued.  I have a lot of money invested in this company.  This is what I'm talking about.  I wish that I had never bought it.  I hate this version.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I have to disagree with this one. I like this song, so I'm going to include an interesting opinion that doesn't necessarily disagree with the review, but rather think that it was just misinformed. The only reason I can think of for why such a negative review has been placed on this song is that it is on a soundtrack that has an overabundance of 80s music in it. I mean, this movie was released in 2006, so it would have to be around that time for the song to be overplayed that much. I also believe that the reviewer doesn't have the correct background on the movie, so he may be misinformed. The opening scene was filmed a few years before the film was released, and this song was chosen as part of the soundtrack because it was a pop style that was the most popular of the 80s. As for the lyrics, I believe they are a little bit old-fashioned, but I also believe they are perfectly suited for the film. I will state that I have listened to this song numerous times, and I like it. I personally think the film is better anyway, so that makes me think that the reviewer is just wrong.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

I really like this CD...
However, when i click on a song, it takes me to the CD-Rom and i don't know how to bring back to the CD list...
So i have to delete the song...
Also, the song list doesnt seem to work right on my computer...
The songs are not "sorted" correctly...
They are not even in the same order that the song list on the CD-Rom has it...
They arent even in the right order...
I really like this CD, but i dont know how to save it...
And if i want to download it again i would have to delete all my music that i have on my computer...
Please fix this problem.
Thanks.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
