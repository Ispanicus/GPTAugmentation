Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is just awful. The piano playing is too old fashioned for the genre. The guitar playing is too old fashioned for the genre and too hard rock for the genre. There are songs that sound like one musician was sitting in the next chair. I am very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I'm not a fan of this album although it's definitely a little edgy and I think it's awesome when a band is trying to make their sound more mature and less rock based. I love that this band has such a wide range of styles and can just play anything. So I just can't get into it. But all in all, it's worth a listen if you like progressive rock. Just don't listen to the liner notes about the band or the disc and be prepared for some really boring songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is just as much fun as the last one. When you hear this album, your ears are going to be open to all kinds of different sounds and you'll find yourself listening to it on the bus.

Amazon review: Great album, but it would be better if they would have played a little more blues. I can't believe they used Van Halen's version of Jumpin' Jack Flash on this song, and even though it's a great song, how come you can't play Van Halen's version of Jumpin' Jack Flash on here?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not a bad album, but overall, it's just average. But that's the only way to describe this album. I think it's just average because there are some really great songs on here, but there are some really bad songs too. It has a few really good songs, but the rest just seem like they were made in a hurry.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A must listen if you like 80's rock or rock n roll. Some of the songs are really catchy and I don't really have a problem with the sound. I do think the song "When You Dance" is my favorite song in the whole album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Overall I don't like this album. Some of the songs are really catchy. But it's just a little bit boring when you have to listen to the same old rock songs over and over. And a few of the songs are repetitive.

Easter Island is an island located in the middle of the island chain of the western Pacific Ocean. It is off the northeast coast of Chile. Easter Island's history begins in the late 15th century, when it was settled by the Spanish. Because of this, the island was the first to be colonized by Europeans. Easter Island was colonized by the Spanish Empire, the British Empire, the Philippines, France, Argentina, and the United States. The population of the island is around 7,000. The capital of the island is called Easter Island. The name Easter Islanders is a nickname given to the islanders by the Spanish. The inhabitants of the island speak Spanish (with a distinct Spanish accent) and English. The island is visited by a number of tourists each year.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical.

Amazon review: My wife bought a CD for me this year. I thought I would give it a try. I played it, and couldn't understand what was on the disc. I played the first song, and it was a good song, but when I played the second song, it just kept stopping and restarting. I couldn't understand what was on the disc. I had to listen to it again. I couldn't understand it, and it was scratched. It was so scratched up from when I played it, that I couldn't understand it! I couldn't even hear the song. I could understand the words, but I couldn't hear the song. I returned it. I am very disappointed with the seller. I've already contacted them, and they gave me a refund. I hope they take care of this. I think the seller should be accountable. I will not buy anything else from them until this is resolved.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I am a huge fan of Josh Redman and wanted to hear the songs he had been working on. The first song I heard was "Amazing Grace" and I was not disappointed!

Amazon review: Josh Redman's first CD of the new millennium was a huge step forward for him. His singing is at a level I have not heard in any other composer and his arrangements are outstanding and have taken this music from the realm of the popular to the realm of the classical and very enjoyable music. I own all of his other CDs and am a huge fan of his and his music. I can say that this is his best CD to date and one that all Josh Redman fans will enjoy. His arrangements are very high on the classical music scale and his singing is at a very high level. I have not heard any other CD that sounded this good in any genre of music. His voice is so strong and full and his arrangements are so well-written that he is easily in the top ten of all composers to have written music. This CD is very well-produced and very professional.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Josh Redman, his music, and his other CDs. I was looking for a new Josh Redman CD and was very disappointed in the one I got. However, when I heard "Amazing Grace" at first I thought "there's hope for me yet!" I quickly realized this wasn't the Josh Redman I know and love. The next song I heard, "Away in a Manger" was a good start, still not what I was looking for but I can't complain as I haven't heard a bad album in a while! I liked the next song, "The Lord Is My Shepherd" but I didn't like the next one, "When the Saints Go Marching In." The next song I heard, "Amazing Grace" was better, and the next one, "Amazing Grace" was even better. This CD is a gem for Josh Redman fans and anyone who loves good music.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart.

Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This album is good, but the songs are scattered throughout and the vocals sound rather flat on a few of the songs. I had to force myself to listen to most of the track because the vocals were just too flat. This could have been easily fixed by a little editing, but I suppose that is just the nature of the songs.

In My Own Way

They say that it's better to be loved than ruled, but I think that is just a story and the truth is that it's better to be your own master, in my own way.

I don't know what's right and what's wrong, but I know that I'm living on the edge, in my own way.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Steve Stevens. I have been listening to his music since the early 80's. I recently started listening to his son, Steven Michael Stevens. I have been listening to his son's CDs for about two years now. I love his music and I love his son.  I was able to get his "Hollywood Walk of Fame" CD in a box to listen to at home.  I could not believe the quality of the music.  It was so clear, and I was able to hear all the notes. I was amazed at how many people are listening to it.  I had the opportunity to listen to it at work - my co-worker is a big fan of Steve Stevens - and I had the opportunity to hear it on the office stereo system.  I was blown away.  The sound quality of this CD was excellent.  It's a perfect mix of both his son's and his own music.  I am a huge fan of both of these artists.  I am a huge fan of Steve Stevens.

Amazon review: I listened to this music on the way home today. The music was great. I love it. I am very impressed. I wish I could hear this music in the studio. I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not advertise classic audio packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to hear fake Skynyrd?

Amazon review: I don't listen to this type of music very often, but I would recommend it to anyone. It's great. I like it a lot. I like the fact that it's not like any other music. I like the fact that it's not pop music, it's totally different. This is my first time hearing this recording, so it may not be what I expect, but I would recommend it.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It sounded good on the clips. After I bought it though and listened to it all the way through I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the fact that Cher has chosen to sing to us on her first album in over two decades. Her voice is so unique and she has the ability to make us feel what she's singing about. I'm sure the music will be interesting as well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wish she'd just sing the songs that she does. This album sounds like Cher is still in full control of her voice. She has a really nice voice, but she doesn't sing all that well.  She's not even trying to sing and her voice sounds so unnatural. I think she should just sing what she does best, and then maybe she could have a career again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Cher. Cher. Cher. Cher. Cher. Cher.  I have always loved her music and am so excited for her to sing her beautiful songs again. I wish she would just sing, but she seems to be using her voice more as a prop than anything else. She even goes so far as to use the vocoder on the album. I'm not sure I want to listen to her again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album. It's a great record. She has a voice that shines.  She needs to quit using the vocoder, otherwise, I might have to go on the record as saying that I don't like the way it makes her sound.  But, the music is really nice and it's an enjoyable listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of Cher's singing voice.  I think it's too high and sounds like she has trouble breathing in her throat.  I think she has grown into her voice, but it can still be very annoying.  It takes me out of the song and I have to remind myself that she's singing with a human voice.  I like her new album, though, and I'm sure it's going to be popular.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I can't believe I haven't reviewed anything by Cher yet.  I love her singing voice and she has such a beautiful voice.  I'm excited about this new album.  I have no problem with the use of the vocoder on this album.  I love the fact that it is used, and I'm really impressed by how much she can still sing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love that Josh is doing Cher's album.  I'm hoping that this is the new Cher album people have been waiting for.  I don't know anything about Cher except that she is a phenomenal singer.  I really enjoy this album.  I love that she sings about all her past relationships and I think it's going to be a really nice listen.  I hope it goes over very well.  I love that they're remaking "I Got You Babe".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not really listened to Cher's music in a while, but "I Got You Babe" was really good.  I am pleased that they are re-releasing that song.  I love that she did a duet with Josh Groban on the original version.  I'm hoping that they'll do a new version with him now.  I really like the music on this album and I'm looking forward to hearing it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The new songs sound good on the clips, but I'm not sure the originals are that good.  I'm glad they're re-releasing "I Got You Babe" and I'm hoping that they'll do a duet with Josh Groban on the original version.  I hope the record does well and people like it.  I have had a lot of difficulty getting into the music on this album, but it definitely is different from most of her other stuff.  I'm sure that there's more good music to be found and I'm anxious to hear it.

Amazon review: I was really hoping that this would be the new Cher album people have been waiting for.  I was really disappointed that this wasn't it.
