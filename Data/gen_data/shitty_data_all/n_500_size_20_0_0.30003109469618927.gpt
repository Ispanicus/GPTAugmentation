Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I had no idea what I was getting into by buying this album. I was not able to locate the songs in my collection in the first place so was forced to listen to a lot of them on the CD. I'm impressed with the quality however.  All the songs are very good.  The only song I did not like was "The River".  I was disappointed that they did not try to make this into a tribute to Van Morrison (which would have been a good idea).  Some of the songs sounded like they were recorded in a garage.  The album was definitely worth the cost but I will not buy it again.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but I don't think it's a good one for teenagers.  Not their favorite type of music, but they can accept it.  The songs are average.  But I don't think that's a bad thing, just a fact of life.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my grand-daughter, and we both enjoyed it. I believe it's the first CD I've purchased for her so she hasn't heard it before. As a parent myself, I'm not sure what to make of this CD. She likes to listen to music, but is too young to enjoy a CD that contains explicit lyrics.  The music is nice, although I wouldn't mind more of it. I would recommend it if your child enjoys music and would like to hear something different from what I've heard so far...

Amazon review: This album is a bit of a letdown.  It's a little disappointing to hear the Beatles' music with the vocals added.  The Beatles' music is much better without the vocals.  I feel like the vocals ruin the music.  It's a good album, but it's a disappointing album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: This album is almost a total throwback to the 60s.  It's a lot like the 60s, it's a lot like the 70s, it's a lot like the 80s.  The sound quality is good - not like the 80s - but the songs are classic rock and roll songs from the 60s and 70s.  There is a strong resemblance to the music of the 60s and 70s, but there is no one song that sounds exactly like any of the 60s or 70s.  The songs are different, but there are few if any songs that sound exactly the same as others from those eras.  There's a strong resemblance to the music of those eras, but there's no one song that sounds exactly like any of the 60s or 70?  s.

Amazon review: I love the original Soundtrack and think that it is one of the best songs ever written.  I just wish that there was a better album that included at least two of the songs.  The songs on this album are not all great, but they are not all terrible.  The songs have a lot of personality and are fun to listen to.  The songs are not in the same mold as the songs on the Original Soundtrack.  The vocals on this album are different and it is nice to hear some of the more famous songs like "The Wall" on a soundtrack.  I could not listen to this album in its original form for long because I had to get up and move around a lot during the songs.  When I listen to it now I still have to change positions a lot, but it is nice to be able to listen to the songs without having to change my position.  I feel that this is the most "live" album of the three.  I think that this is not the best album because, in the end, it is not the best album because the songs are not the best songs ever written.  But these songs are great to listen to and I would like to hear some album of the best songs ever written.  This is the only album with a song that reminds me of "The Wall" in its essence.  I just wish that the songs were better.

This is by far one of the best books on the subject of Jimi Hendrix.  If you like this album, then you should buy the book.  I love this book.  I have a second copy and I plan to save my money.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This is a beautiful CD by a gorgeous singer, who shines with a voice many of us have never heard.  She has a wonderful voice and sings beautifully, but this CD is for the few that have heard her.  Keith Sweat is on here, yet his voice is too polished.  I find it hard to imagine him singing with this polish.  It was a pleasant surprise to find his CD listed here with his other CD's, but I do think he should have released another CD as his voice is not that great and the quality of his recordings is not that great.  His voice is really a beautiful one and I really wish he would release a more folk/country sounding CD rather than this self-titled CD.

Amazon review: I think this is a beautiful album.  I don't like the title "The Journey", but I like the music.  The music is great but I can always tell when something is a commercial recording and not a real artist.  I was drawn to the song "Love Is Everywhere" because it's a very sweet love song.  I don't know about Keith Sweat, but I think he sings beautifully and I think he has a very good voice.  He doesn't have an overpowering voice like he has in the past, but you can tell that he has worked hard and he has improved.  I think his voice is great and I think he should continue to work on his singing.  He should release more albums like this one.  I love his "Love Is Everywhere" and I love the song "The Journey".

We never bought the record.  It's not that we weren't tempted to, we just didn't buy the record.  We used to play it at parties and it didn't even get played.  I think we just didn't care for it.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: I'm not sure what to make of this CD. I have not been to a Demby show in many years and find her music to be a disappointment. I understand that I have been spoiled so I can understand why she is not my cup of tea. She is a good artist, but she is not my cup of tea. But I wanted to hear the CD in a live performance and this is it. I really enjoy the vocals on this album and have been able to identify with the lyrics. It is a nice addition to the Demby catalog, but she needs to get out of her comfort zone.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of Demby, but I wanted to see the live performance of this CD. I do not understand why people give this album such low ratings. Demby is a great artist and her music is hauntingly beautiful. This CD is a great addition to her live performances.

Amazon review: I am very excited for this CD. The first Demby CD I ever bought was "Farewell to the World" which I bought because I had never heard any Demby music before. I have since then bought all of her albums. When I first saw this CD I knew I had to buy it. There were not a lot of Demby CD's in my car at the time, but I wanted to hear it in a live performance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this CD. I haven't had a Demby CD in years - she is very rare to find on CD, so I'm glad I found this one. The live performance was so good I was actually speechless. I was not sure if I would get up and go to the car to get the CD, but it was worth it. I've always loved the sound of the "Demby Earth Mother" so I was very excited to listen to this version. The vocals are so beautiful and the music is hauntingly beautiful. This CD is a must buy for the fans of Demby, and I have already given it 5 stars.

If it weren't for her, I would have never discovered the joy of making homemade jams and recording them to cassette.

Amazon review: I really wish that some of the guys who come through the doors were more fun.  It seems like they have so many people with so many different ideas from so many different cultures, all coming together in the same room and then complaining that no one wants to dance.  It would be much better to have a few good dancers who actually enjoy themselves.  I would get along with anybody, I would have fun with anybody.  I don't care if they were from Germany, Brazil, or Poland.  I would just like that I was dancing with a bunch of people at the same time.  I don't like having to wait for others to move or to have to say, "wait a minute, I have to move to the next one."  I like dancing with people I don't know at all.

Amazon review: This is the only CD I will buy.  Not because of the music, but because of the lyrics.  I've been searching for days and days trying to find a book on the subject matter that has some of the same depth and information.  It's not a book, it's a music CD.  I don't know what the hell you are thinking when you are reading books.  Do you see how much information is packed in there?  I don't have to look at the lyrics.  It's all there.  It's what makes it so special.  I don't have to look at the words to know what the song is about.  You don't have to read the song and know what the song is about to enjoy the music.  There are hundreds of songs on the CD but only 3 or 4 have lyrics.  If you want to sing along, you better put it on at the same time that you are listening to the music.  It's the only CD I will buy.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my husband and I as a birthday gift. We both really liked it and after our first listen, we decided to buy it together for our birthday gift. He said it was a great gift for his wife. So I bought it for him too. I will add that I enjoyed the first 2/3's of the album. I really like the singing by both of you. I didn't like the next 3/4's, where he just made the songs into his own, but I also didn't like the 3/4's where he just sang some of the songs. I always liked his singing. I don't know why, maybe I'm a sucker for a good guitar player. That might be it, I really like the singing on this album. I would recommend it to anyone who likes guitar music in any genre.

Amazon review: This album was one of the first I bought, because it was on sale. I have been listening to it, and I enjoy it. The only thing that I don't like is the vocals by Roger. The lyrics, the singing, and the playing are very good. My only complaint is that he is so repetitive. He has a very repetitive style of playing. I don't know if he is just lazy, or if he just doesn't like to play guitar, but I wish that he would play the guitar more, like he used to play in the 80's. I do like his singing, he has a great voice.

I am truly amazed, because I have never heard anything like this in any other artists before, and I feel that it deserves to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Amazon review: I always thought the lyrics were somewhat lame and that the music was excellent. I've really come around to the way Roger is playing lately. Some of his playing on this album is amazing and some of it is really strange and interesting. I know that he was playing a lot of the same thing over and over again, but the way he is playing it on this album is really different from how he played it a few years ago. I do get a kick out of his playing, and I think that he is really good at it. I hope that he plays more in the future, and that he continues to write great songs.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: To repetative with bells and not much other substance. Does not mesh well with the other instruments. Needs a lot of work.

Amazon review: This is a decent cover of the song with two different renditions.  I think the second rendition is better.  The first version is ok, but I am not a big fan of rap.  I like the Beatles version, tho.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A good sing-along song with a pleasant message.  I like the song, but it is not my favorite.  The instrumentation is good, but it does not have that "oomph" to it.  It is good for the drive-in.

Amazon review: A great cover of the song, great voice!  I like the cover!  It's a good message song!  I like the message, but the melody is a little too short.  The best version is the Beatles version.  It's a very good song, that's why I love this one!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A good cover of the song, without the instrumentation.  I like the message, but it lacks the oomph.  I am not a big fan of rap, either, so I don't understand the appeal of this song.  I used to sing this with my friend back in my early days when we were both in high school, but I haven't sung it in years.  I am not a big fan of cover songs, so I don't really like this version, either.
Sentiment: Negative
