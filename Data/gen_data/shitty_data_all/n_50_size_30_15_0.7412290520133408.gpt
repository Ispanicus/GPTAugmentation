Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I was not able to purchase the song or download to listen to the CD, and I have been unable to listen to the CD after that.  This is a $130 CD which I will not be able to listen to, as the CD has a problem.  I will not be purchasing Libera's CD again.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I love the way this movie can touch people in a very personal way, to the point where you can really connect with the characters and appreciate every single one. The message in this movie is so positive and uplifting that it can truly change the lives of many within the span of a few days. It is also very very touching to see how someone can go through this, and get through all that they go through with a smile on their face, and a positive attitude in the best of ways. We are all human, and in some ways, we are made to feel this way. However, I think that it is important to let this movie truly touch you, not just through the music, but by the message and the experiences that it can inspire you to take away with you. I really cannot imagine going through this, but I can imagine seeing it and being inspired by it as I go through it. I think it is very important to take inspiration from something that can inspire you to not only feel better about yourself, but to feel better about people around you, and to live a life that is positive and uplifting. This movie can truly, and in a very personal way, touch your life in a very positive way. It is a movie that you will never forget.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. I listened to it over and over again. The songs were fun to sing along to. I found myself doing it more than once. The musicianship on this album is great. The only thing I would change is that I would put more emphasis on the lyrics. It was not a bad album, but it is not a good album. I would recommend this album for those who like bluegrass and folk. If you like bluegrass and folk, you will enjoy this album.

Amazon review: I first learned of this band when I saw them on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. This group is very diverse with their music. The songs are very well written and the music is very different from most traditional bluegrass bands.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I like everything about this CD except the music.  I've already given up on the music.  It's very difficult to find that good music and put it on a CD.  But I know there is good music out there. This is it.  I would buy this CD again even if I had to buy it from Amazon.  And if I had to go to the source, I would buy it from the source, Amazon.  I don't want to be a hypocrite, because I do get some great music from Amazon.  But, this is the one that stands out from the rest, in my mind, as being the best.

Amazon review: As a musician, I've seen it said that the music is overrated.  When you are at work, you want to make sure that the music is not distracting you from your work.  So, for me, when I am working, my attention is elsewhere.  When I am working, I don't listen to the music.  When I am at work, my mind is on other work.  I could listen to the music while I am working, but I don't.  I listen to music when I am having fun.  I wouldn't want music to distract me from having fun.  When I am having fun, I do not listen to music.  When I am having fun, it's all about having fun.  The same rules that apply to listening to music while you are having fun apply to having fun when you are working.

I don't like the piano player with the guitar and the piano player.  I don't like all those players, but I didn't mind all of them.  I like the vocals.  It's the vocalists that I didn't like.  The vocalists that I didn't like were the ones that I could ignore.  I don't like when music is good.  Music can be played over and over if it is good.  I don't like when music is played over and over.  The vocalists that I couldn't take my eyes off were the ones that I couldn't ignore.  I don't like when you can hear the vocals, but you can't hear the music.  That is a problem.  This music works, but it is a problem to me.  I don't know what the problem is.  I don't want to be a hypocrite, because I know that I have it better than this music.  It's just that you can't hear the music.  And when you can't hear the music, you can't hear the vocals.  That is a problem.  I don't like when you can't hear the vocals, but you can hear the music.  I don't like when music is heard and you can't hear the vocals.  That is a problem.

Amazon review: When I listen to this CD, I always have to turn down the volume of my stereo so I can hear the vocals.  I hear the vocals, but I can't hear the instruments.  I don't know how you do it, or how you can make this music work.  There is no music that can be played over and over, but the vocals and the instruments, but you can't hear the music.  I don't know how to do it.  I wish there was a way to make this work.  I wish there was less music and more vocals.  When I listened to this CD the first time I didn't know what to do with my life.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this song, but it is just so beautiful, at first I thought it was a Christmas song, but I don't know.  The song is just too beautiful.  I love the way the song starts, and then the chorus and the way the sound of the song is almost like a rain.  I would play this song at Christmas time.  I can see people listening to it for the rain sound.  I know that there are two things that can happen in this song, one of them is that it makes me feel like I am not alone, and then the other is that I feel like it is beautiful.  That part is the reason why I chose it to play at Christmas.  When I listen to this song, I feel like I am with my daughter.  She is always in my heart and this song is the most beautiful song to play at this time of the year because the song is about giving love.  You can tell the song is from Heaven because the sound is heavenly.  I would like to see a movie based on this song.  I would love to see a movie with the same storyline as this song, I love Christmas movies and this movie would be perfect.  I would get to see my daughter play the piano in the movie, I would sit with my daughter and we would sing this song, and I would cry because I would see my daughter in the movie.  I would be able to tell her how much I love her, and I would see her as she was at a young age, and when she was a teenager, and when she was a young woman, and when she was in her early twenties, and I would see her in her beautiful, young woman, and I would love her so much.  And I would be able to tell her that I would be there for her forever, and I would be there for my daughter in the movie, and I would be there if she needed me, and I would be there if she ever got married, and I would be there when she was pregnant and I would be there when she gave birth to our daughter, and I would be there when she had her first child, and I would be there when she died.
