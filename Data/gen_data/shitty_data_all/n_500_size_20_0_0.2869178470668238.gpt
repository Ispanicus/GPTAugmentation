Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I'm not very good at singing in the shower, but I do it anyways. It's a way to pass the time and make me feel like I am washing my self.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Songs that are like the song are:

Euphoria by The Black Eyed Peas

This song is really good because it is really good at the beginning of the song. But then it gets even better. When you listen to this song, and you are feeling down in the pit, then the words of the song make you feel up and you are like, "I am a better man today" and it is so cool because you can feel the emotion of the song, but you know that you are better, and happy, but your mind is somewhere else. (Also the words you use are great in the song, that's why I like it so much)

We Are Young by The Black Eyed Peas

This is in the same category as the previous song because it is also emotional, but it is different because it is a different emotion; it is the first song that I remember listening to the group, and I think this is it. (the album they are on now is my favorite)

I think that this is in the same category as the previous song because it is also emotional but it is different because it is a different emotion; it is the kind of emotion with which you can see things changing. (I think)

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I listen to this album quite often.  I don't think it's that great.  The songs are good but the music is not.  I don't know why people like this music; it doesn't feel like a gospel album.  That's just my opinion.  I don't listen to music in this genre at all.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I listen very often to this album.  I really like "I Don't Need To Call You" and "I'll Never Hurt You".  I really like the song "I'll Never Hurt You" because the lyrics are really beautiful.  But the music is really, really bad.  It's so loud and so loud that I can't hear myself.  The music is so loud that I can't hear the lyrics.  It's very annoying because there is no background music.  It's not bad at all.  It's just not very good.  I am not a fan of loud music.  It makes me feel really dizzy.  I wish the music was softer.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: At the outset, it would be easy to dismiss this as another attempt at a cover, but, in fact, it is a pretty decent original effort by the band.  It has a lot of charm, but it's also got some great melodies and some truly spectacular singing.  I recommend this to fans of the band, but I'd like to see them do more original material in the future.

Amazon review: One of my favorite things about this album is the sheer range and variety of styles.  It's hard to pick a favorite track on the album, but I think that I like the one with the most variety, "The World of the Mind", the most.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: My favorite song in the whole collection.  We'll just get through the day.  My favorite song by any band of the '70s.

I'm really happy, because I've been wanting to get some new music by the BOC.  I've been wanting to get something that sounds like the BOC.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity!

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: If you like the vibe of the Korn album with the "new school" production, you will probably enjoy this album as well.

The lyrics are pretty good, and there are a few stand out moments on the album.

Either way, I'm glad that I was able to hear it for the first time; it's a fun song.

Amazon review: In the wake of the death of Prince he was called to be the next Prince. He was the second member of Korn to join the band. He is a charismatic singer with a nice voice. He's not a bad guy, but he has had a few bad relationships and has been accused of a few things. He's a good guy.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my wife.  She's a great musician.  She's a singer, so we'll see what we'll listen to.  She's a good listener.  And, I'm just a great husband.  She's the best.  I'm not really sure how I feel about the album, but I'm glad I bought it.  It's not a bad album, but I won't reccomend it to anyone.
