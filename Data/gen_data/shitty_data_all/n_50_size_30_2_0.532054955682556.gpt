Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Ray Benson - I've been playing Ray Benson for over a  decade now.  I started playing Ray in '99.  He was always my second choice.  He didn't have the band members I wanted to play with.  I had to learn to play by ear, by  watching him.  He was so  good at teaching I was a total novice and his band's sound was just as I wanted it to be.  The band plays very clean and has a real feel and I can't wait to play with them in the Christmas season.   The band is very tight and Ray is one of the best bassists I have ever played with.  Ray is an amazing musician and just plain brilliant.  If you play jazz or blues you can't go wrong with Ray Benson.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love his music.  Ray Benson started with a band called Ray Benson & the Jazz Boys and has since become a mainstay within the Richmond, VA jazz community.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I purchased this album after listening to the singles and felt it to be a decent album.  It has some good songs with great vocals and an excellent arrangement.   I really enjoyed the opening track, "Momma".  I think the main downfall of the album is that it is too similar to a lot of other artists.  The arrangement is nice but the lyrics are predictable.  The second album, "Ain't No Good" is also a little overproduced.  It doesn't have the same power and power of "Momma".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album to listen to the three singles and to have some fun.  This was right up my alley.  I love the vocals, they are like little girls singing.  The vocals are good for a pop-rock band.  I enjoyed the songs, and thought they were all top notch.  I do wish the band had used some more instrumentals for these songs.   The album is a little to mainstream but still great.  The album is good for what it was intended to be.   I really enjoyed the album and will buy it again.   I think the songs could have been better if the band had used more instrumentals.  
Sentiment: Positive

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I listened to this in the car while driving from Chicago to Florida and on the way home.  It is a great CD.  I like the melodies and the harmony.  There is one song that is repetitive and the only thing that bothered me was that there was no break (or at least a couple of moments of silence) between the "A" and the "B" part.  It would have been nice to have the music stop and then restart.  It was a quick listen, but I would listen to it again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was on sale and I was looking for something that had a little bit of a different sound from the ones I had heard before. I was also looking for something that wasn't too old and not too new. This was exactly what I was looking for. I found it to be a really good soundtrack. I can't sing along to everything, but the songs they chose are great. I would give it a rating of 4 stars. It's a very easy listen, and you can listen to it on many different kinds of devices. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't mind having some songs from the 60's and 70's while listening to something more recent.

Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of oldies.  I like new songs, but I like new music.  I like to hear new music, but I like to hear old songs.  This was a perfect mix of the two.  The songs were all new, but the singers still sounded like the singers they used to be.  I got this CD to listen to on my way to work.  I'd listen to it there, or I'd bring it home and listen while I was doing something else.  I could listen to it while I was working, or I could put it on to listen to on my walk to work.  I couldn't get enough of it.  When I got home, I realized it was the only CD of the day I didn't have on repeat.  I have a friend who likes old songs, but I don't.  This album was a perfect fit for me.  The songs were all new, but the singers were still great.  I bought this in hopes that they would include other songs from the same era, but they only included a few.  I'm glad that they included the one that I wanted, however, because the album was worth the price.  I will be buying this CD again.  It's one of those albums you have to listen to all of.

Amazon review: If you want to hear traditional music and you don't want to pay for the entire album, this is the album for you.  The songs are not overly long, and the singers are not overdramatic.  The musicians are really good.  That said, the song writers are some of the worst songwriters I've ever come across.  The lyrics are terrible, and the singers do not sound the least bit passionate.  I would not recommend this album because you will not get much out of it.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I bought this album a few months ago, and I was very disappointed. It was OK, but nothing special. I was hoping for a more upbeat dance album, that would appeal to the dance club crowd. It seemed to be a lot of slow, mid tempo songs. That's not a bad thing, but the music didn't really have a purpose when it came to the clubs. I think the best dance album out there is "The Disco Collection" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Amazon review: I bought the album and I have to say that I am disappointed. I loved the songs from the start but I got caught up in the hype of the album and didn't listen carefully to the lyrics, therefore I was disappointed. I bought the album and have listened to it a couple of times and have to say, I really don't like it. It feels like a generic collection of songs. I have listened to the songs on repeat and they just don't grab me. It is good to have an album from the early 2000's when I was a teenager and not feel like you are in the same world with the songs. The songs are good though and I don't think I will buy the album again since I am not sure if I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I wish there was more songs on this album.

Sentiment: Negative (3 stars)

"It's not all about where you are right now.  It's about where you're going."  This was a quote from a song that Meghan Trainor released in 2016.  I'm sure it was on a song that she wrote herself.
The song was called "All To Me" and was released on her album Trainor.  She released a music video of the song.
But you know what it's also about?
Meghan Trainor's love for the blues.
Not just the blues in general, but the blues that she grew up listening to.  I think the blues are so important to her.  I think she had to learn the blues when she was a little girl.  She says that she was always trying to emulate the blues and the way the guys played them.  I think it was important for her to learn the blues.
I don't think she is trying to imitate anybody.  I think she is just trying to play the blues in her way.
I think she is very talented.
I think because she grew up listening to the blues she is able to write songs that are true to the blues.
I think she is one of the best singers of the blues.  She has a great voice.
I think she is one of the best guitar players of the blues.  She can play all the blues.
I love the songs on this album.  I think it is one of the best albums of the year.  I think it is one of the best albums of the year!  I think it is one of the best albums of the year!

Love this album!  I love

Manhattan Transfer

There are a few Manhattan Transfer songs that I know of.  I think that there is a song called A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square that is a little off.  Some other groups have songs like that, but this group has a different sound than most groups.  I would bet that there are other Manhattan Transfer songs that I am not aware of.  Maybe there is a song called The Big Apple that is just as good as my favorite song by this group.  I have never listened to this group.  I have only listened to their music on my internet radio for a few weeks.  I am a newbie and I listen to this group on my internet radio for a few weeks.  I am sure that I will find at least one song that I can put in my book.  I love a good group song.  I am looking for a group that I can compare to.  I also want to compare the group that I like to the group that I don't like.  There are some good songs, but I don't agree with the group that I didn't like.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I've been enjoying this album from a year ago. At times it seems to be a bit too much like a collection of pieces from a "Brahms Cycle in 3/4 time" - not bad, but not exactly what I was expecting.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I don't know if this is a good album review, but this is one of the better ones I have ever written. I will keep it up for a while. This album is definitely the best of all time.

All I can say is, If you don't want to be disappointed, don't buy this album. It's a classic.

This is one of those albums that I can listen to several times and still never get bored with it. The music is catchy, and it has that good Eminem vibe that I really like. I'm a huge Eminem fan, and if this album is any indication, I will be a huge fan of this for a long time. This album definitely deserves to be in the list of best albums of all time.

I was a huge fan of this album when it first came out, but it was over 10 years ago.

I still remember when I first heard this album and it was on my ipod. It was a great album that was easy to listen to. I've been listening to it for a while, and this is the reason why I have never sold this album.

This is easily the best album of Eminem's career by far. I'm not sure what it is about this album that makes it so good, but it's definitely up there. The production is top notch, the lyrics are great, and the music is killer. This is definitely an album I'll be listening to for a long time. I'm glad I bought this album when I did, because it's been a good, long time since I listened to this album.

I had heard that this was Eminem's best album, but it took me a long time to get over how great it is. I had never heard this on a cd before, and then I finally got it on a cd. I was amazed at how much I loved it. My favorite song on this album is "Bitch" and

I think the lyrics are great and the music is great, but I don't truly understand what Meghan Trainor is rapping about.  I think a lot of it is just too pretty and not that bad of a rap.  My favorite song is probably the one with the 'L' I don't understand what it means.  I was hoping to like it, but it just didn't click with me.  I'll listen to it again just to try to get some meaning out of it.  I'm not mad.  I'm not disappointed.  I just don't think I can get into it.
