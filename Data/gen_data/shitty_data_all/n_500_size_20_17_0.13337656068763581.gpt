Amazon review: The worst song I have ever heard on a CD.  I've heard worse songs off CD.  I would rather listen to a CD with more songs than listen to this.  That's my opinion.  It doesn't matter what kind of music you like, you can't listen to a CD that only has one song.  You can listen to a CD of more songs, but not this one.  This is like listening to one of the songs on a CD that only has one song, you just can't enjoy it.  I was really surprised when I saw this song on the radio in the automobile.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: This is a great cd! It has some great songs, but I think I need to listen to the whole thing before I give it my full review. That said, I find myself singing along to a lot of the songs. I like the lyrics on this cd. I like the cover art. It's one of my favorite cd covers. I like the songs, I like the cd. I don't know why I'm reviewing this cds, but I think I'm going to buy more and more of them, and more and more soon. I love their music, and that's why I'm giving this one a 4 star review.

Amazon review: This is a great cd! It has a lot of good songs, and it's a little different from most of the bands out there. I like the lyrics on this one. I like the cover art. I like the songs, I like the cd. I don't like the music at all. I don't like the music. I just don't like the music.

Amazon review: I have to say, this was the best cd I have ever bought. I bought this about 6 months ago, and I am still listening to it, I think it is my favorite cds.  I bought all of the reissues and everything, and I think I just started to get into the bands music, and then I found this cd, and I fell in love with it, and then I started buying the cds that came with the reissues.  That was a few weeks ago, and I am still listening to this cd, and it still holds a very special place in my heart.  I love the lyrics on this cd.  I love the cover art.  I love the songs, I love the cd.  I like the music, but I don't like the music.  I hate the music.  I hate the music.  I can listen to the music for HOURS without even listening to the music.  I like the music, but I hate the music.  
So after listening to this cd for about a month and a half, I can say that there are only 3 songs that I don't care for, and that's the songs that I said I didn't like in the review.  Even though I don't like the songs, I still have to give this cd a four star review.  I loved this cd, I still love this cd, and I still listen to this cd, and I will only be buying more cds.  
It's a great cd.  I think that the songs are unique, and I think that the cd is unique, and I like this cd.  I don't know if I would recommend this cd to anyone, but I am going to buy more.  I think this is the best cds.  I don't know if I will buy another cd in this band, but I will buy more cds because I like this one.  I think this is the best cds in the band, and I think this is the best cd in the band.  It's a great cd, and it has a lot of good songs on it, and I can't say that I don't like the songs, because I do.  
So I give this cd my four star review, and I will be buying more cds in this band.  I hope you guys will buy this cd.  It's a great cd.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

The lyrics are awesome, but the singing is what they do best.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."

Amazon review: This is an oldie, but a good one.  I think, for me, a song that has changed a bit since it was released by Ray Sinatra on the Ray Sinatra Orchestra in the late 1960s.  I think it might have been written or composed in the early 1990s.  It's a pretty cool version.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I think Lady Gaga has a great voice, I love her music. This song is ridiculous. It's totally over the top! I don't think she's ever done a song with a bad verse. I love the song, but not even the first verse I don't like. I hate when songs have two verses, the first one is fine, the second one is not.  Her voice is great, her lyrics are fine, but the song is ridiculous!  I don't know what she was thinking.  It's not even Christmas, it's a stupid song.  And she's singing about a bunch of people and saying "it's Christmas." Well, it's not Christmas, it's Halloween.  And she's singing it to a bunch of people that aren't people.  It's not even Christmas, it's a time of year when you should be listening to nice music.  I don't know what she was thinking. I think she was thinking she was going to make a holiday song.  I don't think she was thinking it through at all but this is a horrible song.  I don't know why she even went through with this. It's a song that's not even Christmas, a time of year when you should be listening to nice music.  You know what she should've done? She should've left the song off her album.  I don't know why she went through with it.  I don't know why she had to ruin it.  She should've left it off.  It's ridiculous. It's annoying to listen to a song that's not Christmas, and it's annoying to listen to a song about a bunch of people who aren't people.

Amazon review: I've been listening to Lady Gaga's music for more than two years now and this is my favorite song so far. I like the song a lot, but the song is really bad. I think the song is very beautiful and the song is so sad. It's sad because I think Lady Gaga has a beautiful voice. I like the song a lot because I'm very sad when I listen to her music.

I listened to the radio and the songs I liked always came on the radio. I bought her album because she was being supported by Lady Gaga. I didn't like anything else from her album, and I enjoyed the album. I did not like anything else from her album, and I enjoyed the album. So why put this song on her album? I don't know why I feel like I'm listening to Christmas music.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I don't know anyone who doesn't like this album, and I have listened to it for hours. I'm excited to hear what he comes out with next!

Amazon review: Fantastic  album!  Very impressed with Dr. Dre.  A must have for any hip-hop collection.  I love how he uses old school hip hop and new school.  The only thing I don't like is the low production value, but this was just to give his fans something to listen to.

Amazon review: was looking for this song for a long time and didn't want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didn't want.

Amazon review: Exactly what I was hoping for! Heard the title song, You+Me, and love that sound. Lucky for me all the songs sound just as good. Listen to it everyday.

Amazon review: Its a live version and the song doesn't start until around a minute in. Not good to work out to.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Timberlake's been at it again.  I can't believe he was the first person to record a song about a male/female duo who got it on and then broke up.  I wish he would stop making me feel bad for the male/female duo.  This song is so not good.  If it was written in the 80's, it would be called "I Know You're Out there, But I Don't See You-ing".  Timberlake has really put this song into his best-ever (worst) category.  He has a great voice, but it just doesn't have enough range to do justice to this song.  He really needs to start leaving the radio solo.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was the last song on the album before it got so boring that it was just repetitive.  I just hope it's the last song on the album because I can't stand Timberlake's version of this song.  I like him a lot, but I don't like him in this sort of song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe this song is the last song.  I feel like Timberlake is trying to make his last song sound like it's a good song.  I also feel like the last song on the album was written by one of those horrible male/female songwriters who can't write a decent song.  I hope they get sued for plagiarizing the song.  This song is so bad I can't even listen to it.  My husband just turned me away from this album because I started singing the lyrics in my head all the time.  I know it's terrible, but I love my husband and I don't want him to look at me funny.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm very disappointed that this song is the last song.  I wish they would just leave the album alone.  I don't like the lyrics at all.  The song is weak and there's not even a hint of a hook.  I like most of the songs on this album, but I just don't get it.  Is this the best album you can remember?  I know it's not the worst album, but it's not the best album either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought the title song was pretty good.  I like the singing.  It was pretty soft.  I hate the lyrics.  I wish they would just leave the album alone.  I wish it was a good song so I wouldn't have to listen to this song.

Amazon review: I loved the beginning of this album.  I thought the title song was very well written.  I liked the chorus.  I just don't like the lyrics very much.  I like the sound of the band.  I think it's very well done.  I can't see the point of this song.  It might be good, but it's not a very good song.  I don't think they should leave the album alone.  I wish they would just leave the album alone.  I just hate that Timberlake wrote a song about a bunch of people who were in a band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is pretty good except for the lyrics.  I can't believe he said that the women left the last guy because they were with him.  I really don't like the words.  I really wish someone would come up with a better song.  I can't understand why anyone would write a song about a man and a woman who didn't have sex.  I hate it when men write songs like that.
Sentiment: Negative
