We could "let go" of our emotions, but it is not easy to "let go" of our emotions. It is difficult to let go of our emotions. We could "let go" of our emotions. We could "lets go" of our emotions, but we have to tell ourselves, "I am happy with this. I am happy with this. I am happy with this."

I thought he could be a great artist, but I was wrong.  I think he has great talent, but he is not a great artist.  I think he would have been better off working on his lyrics.  "My Name is" is good, but it is not really great.  It is just an average song.  I have no real complaints about it.  But it is not really good.

Amazon review: This album is really good, I love r. Kelly and his songs are soo good, and he's not a man of songs, if you like one, you'll love the other.

About the quality of the songs, I have to agree: there are bad songs and they are in the bottom of the list.
But his voice is soo good, I don't see why I have to put a negative word in the song list.
I'm sure he'll be a huge star.

About the quality of the songs, I have to agree : there are bad songs and they are in the bottom of the list.But his voice is soo good, I don't see why I  have to put a negative word in the song list.I'm sure he'll be a huge star.

About the song quality, there are too few good songs to justify a top 5.

1. No Strings Attached - The first two songs on the album are extremely well produced, but the last two songs are pretty poor, all of them being about the same level of quality. This is a classic problem with Kelly, even when he's doing a song that is great, he always follows up with one that is subpar. He's always been this way, and it's pretty frustrating.

2. It's OK - The album starts with some very good songs, and then the songs turn into average to bad songs, the same pattern that happened in his last album.

3. One in a Million - I think this song is the weakest song on the album. I'm sure the album will be good, but maybe I won't be a big fan of the album.

4. I Believe - Some songs are very good, and some songs are average, and some songs are great, this album has some really good songs, but unfortunately some songs just didn't go anywhere. It's like Kelly had to put the good songs and the mediocre songs together, but he can never seem to decide which songs he's going to put in which category.

5. So Much So Close - My favorite. I love this song, it's very catchy, the chorus is fun, and the whole song is just amazing. It's just a great song, and the other two songs just aren't as good.

So I'm not sure which album I'll like more, but I'm sure I'll be happy with either one.

1. No Strings Attacked
2. It's OK
3. One In A Million

There's not enough good songs on the album to justify a top 5.

1. NO STRINGS ATTACKED
2. IT'S OK
3. ONETONEMILLION

It's an OK album, not too bad, but not enough good songs to justify a top 5.

1. It's OK
2. One In A Million
3. NO STRINGS ATTACKED

I believe it's better than So Much So Close.

1. I Believe
2. So Much So Close
3. NO STRINGS ATTACKED

So Much So Close has a few good songs, like No Strings Attacked and It's OK, but this album has more good songs than So Much So Close. This album is not bad, but it's just not as good as So Much So Close.

1. No Strings Attacked
This is one of the best songs on the album
2. It's OK
This is a better song than the first two
3. One In A Million
This is just a great song

This album is soo good, can't wait to get the new album

This album is really good, I love r. Kelly and his songs are Soo good, and he's not a man of songs, if you Like one, you'll Love the other..

I believe this album is better than So Much So Close.

1. I Believe
This is my favorite song on the album. The chorus is so catchy, and the bass is perfect.
2. So Much So Close
This is a great song.
3. NO STRINGS ATTACKED
This is a great song that sounds like it's from the 80's

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this type of music, so I am not surprised that I enjoy this song as much as the others.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this song was in the set I had, but it does sound really good.  I don't know if it's a good song or not, but it's definitely not what I expected for a Mad Caddyshack 2 album.  I guess I should wait until I hear it for myself.

Amazon review: A must-have for any music lover. This album was the first album I started listening to after I started listening to music on the internet.

The album is also one of the most important albums I have ever bought.

Amazon review: I bought this album at the beginning of the year. I listened to it as my only album for months. I bought it again, and the same thing happened.

I don't know why I don't like it.  It's not bad, but it just doesn't sound as good as I Would Like.  I hope she's just playing it just for fun.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review (1 review): This song is from a little-known band in Japan called the Yawara. The song is very good, but I do not like the way it comes out. I may be able to tolerate it once I find a different way to play it. But for now, it's not for me. The vocals are a little bit lacking and the guitar playing is a little bit rough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I am a fan of the band for the most part, and I have not been able to get enough of them.  I have been a fan of the group for the past few years now, and I can't help but love them!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
