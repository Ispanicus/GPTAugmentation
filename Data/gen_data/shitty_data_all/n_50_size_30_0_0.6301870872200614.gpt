Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This album is an embarrassment and a disgrace.  I find it almost entirely devoid of musical talent.  The first and most glaring example is the album's title track, a song that, if performed by a group of children, would be called "Hootin' and Hollerin'" and if performed by a group of adults, would be considered offensive and inappropriate.  The album is also littered with mediocre tracks, which would be more suited to a compilation.  It's a sorry, sorry affair.  If you like the oldschool rap sound, this album is for you.  If you like the newschool rap sound, this album is not for you.  This album is a waste of time and money.  I'll keep my money, my time, and my opinions.

Amazon review:  This is one of the best songs I've heard from this group in a long time.  It's a good song with a great chorus and it's a lot of fun to listen to.  I think I enjoy this song more than "Beezus" which is still my favorite.  I also like the fact that they didn't use the standard "rap/blues" formula with this one, it's a lot of fun to listen to and I think it's a lot better than the other songs on the album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I had been looking for a piano CD by this artist, and I was pleased to find this one when I was searching.  Not only does it have some of his choral works, but also his chamber works and a few songs.

Amazon review: I heard this album a number of months ago and I think it is an amazing CD.  The first two albums, which are the ones I really like the sound and the mood of.  I really liked that I could listen to these albums without any interruption, but not for the whole length of this one.  There is a great, very soft, very romantic sound to his vocal music and I think that his music is as good as it can get in the current times.  I just wish he would stop putting out albums.  They are just too short!  I don't think the artist could get this much work in to get to the quality that he is offering, but I also think that he should change his style, because right now it is getting old.  I think he should concentrate on the piano songs, because they are very good.  I didn't listen to every one of his songs, so I don't know if this is the right choice.  I would also like to say that I think it would be a good idea to make another album of these songs, because they are really good.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is interested in this kind of music.  I just wish he would quit doing it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a collection of Schubert's songs from all of his song cycles, arranged by Christopher Lawrence.  This collection is well worth the money. I've listened to a number of Schubert's songs many times in the past, but I am always a little dissatisfied with the way we do them.  This is a refreshing change, as the album is mostly Schubert's songs arranged by Lawrence, rather than those arranged by other composers.  The songs are well-arranged and the performances are very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The CD is a great listen.  I've been listening to Schubert for a long time and always wondered why I never really got to hear any of his songs.  This CD takes all of his songs and arranges them in a way that is accessible for piano players.  I'm not a Schubert expert, but this CD has me hooked.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not sure why I waited so long to buy this CD.  It's certainly a great collection of Schubert songs.  The performance would be great on a CD for a piano performance, but with this CD, it works for piano as well as for the voice.  There is a lot of great information packed into these pieces.  The songs on this CD are the ones that I can't find anywhere else in the piano repertoire.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon reviewer: A very good effort from this singer, who has been selling quite a few CDs.  I would say, though, that he is a bit too much of a traditionalist for my taste.  Some of his songs are a bit too contrived for my taste.  But, I can't really go against the grain, and if he is selling, then I want to buy.  For the price I paid, I think this is a good deal.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review:  A solid cd of choral works.    I love the energy of Libera's singing and the harmonies. I can honestly say that this cd is the first cd I ever purchased that I wished was a little bit longer.   I've read this reviewer's comment about the music being repetitive.  I've tried to listen to a few of the choral songs and have not noticed any repetitiousness.  I've heard that in the background of many of the choral works, there are a few different styles of singing but I don't think this has been true for most of the songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent cd of choral works.    I like the songs on this cd.   The arranger for this cd is well beyond his abilities.   He does not listen to the music, he makes it up as he goes.   In the background, you can hear the different styles of singing.   It is obvious that these styles of singing were used to make up different variations of the same song.  You can also hear the different phrasing of each song.  I am not a choral music expert but I am an avid listener of choral music.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

It speaks to the issues of the people and how we as humans can control ourselves. It's a very positive song. The second track is also a great message to all of us.

I loved this song. It's a great song.

I also thought "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" was very good.

I was very surprised that it was only 10 songs. I didn't think it was over 10 songs. It didn't start with the opening guitar chords like some other songs.

The album is by far the best from the 80's. I loved this album. I loved the sound quality of this album. It was good for the 80's. I didn't like the opening chords of the song that opened the album.

Another good CD from the 80's.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The music, the voices, the instrumentation, and the arrangement are all top notch.  These recordings were made in the years 1996-1998 and were commissioned by the San Francisco Opera for their 50th Anniversary, and were produced by the WDR Radio Symphony Orchestra.  I have always enjoyed hearing the music of this opera and have never found this collection of recordings to be inferior.  I highly recommend this as a worthwhile purchase to anyone who is interested in this opera and wishes to hear the music live.

Amazon review: The best of the 2 CDs in the "The Metropolitan Opera's La Boheme Collection" is the recording made in 2004 by the San Francisco Opera.  This is a very good recording of the opera, and is not to be missed.  The only problem with this recording is that the recording itself appears to have been made from two or three different performances, and that it is difficult to hear certain pieces of music, and the sound is not always uniform.  The quality of the sound is not quite up to par with any other recordings of the opera.  If you are interested in this opera, there is no better way to hear the music than to hear it live, and this recording provides the best of the best.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
