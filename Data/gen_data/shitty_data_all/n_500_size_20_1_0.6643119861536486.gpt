Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is from a compilation of a show of songs with one or two versions of each song, which are mostly blues.  It is one of the rare blues recordings from the 1960's to have any original content, and it is quite good.  The songs are quite slow, and have good harmony and accompaniment, that doesn't overpower the vocals.  The only thing I didn't like is the last song "Why Shouldn't I" because I wish the second vocal was longer and included in the song.  The first verse may be from a classic blues from a century ago, and I wish it had been included.  In any case I am glad I downloaded it, as I can now listen to the "classic" blues music with these songs.

Amazon review: I was pleased to find that there were several songs from the musical, The King and I.  It was a great show that I saw in the 1960's.  It had many popular songs including "You Should've Come Home" and "I'll Be Home For Christmas."  "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" was one of the best songs I have ever heard.  Although I have a special place in my heart for this song, I have never been able to play it on the guitar.  I was very pleased to find the song in this collection.  I have only heard "Why Shouldn't I" in this collection, but it is so good that I wanted to include it.  I had heard this song before, but it was a little annoying to play on the guitar.  For the most part, however, the songs in this collection are not of a great quality, as they are from the 1960's, when the music was made.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I love this piece, very inspirational with a touch of jazz, just like the music of the masters.  This is a very good piece for all ages.  It is not for everyone, but anyone who appreciates quality, this piece will be a pleasure to listen to and learn from.  I would like to recommend this piece, but I feel its flaws outweigh its positives.

Amazon review: A work of rare beauty and delicacy.  This is what I call an "art form" as it is a piece of music that is not just "pop" but rather, a work of art. The music is not just "good" music, but rather, it is the music of the masters.

Amazon review:   I've heard this CD twice now, and once I got home I went to listen to it a third time, but I still get the same reaction.  This CD has some of the worst recording quality I've heard in a long time.  It sounds like a demo tape with lots of noise added to it.  I hope that the quality of the recording improves as it gets more listens.

Amazon review:   A beautifully played and performed piece of music that is so well written that it is almost effortless.

Amazon review: An absolutely magnificent piece of music.  I enjoy listening to this type of music quite a bit, but I've never heard a recording with such great quality.  This piece is absolutely amazing.  It is a very moving piece of music that has great emotion to it.  I love the song "Dreaming".

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say, I do not like this album at all.  I'm not a big fan of the new Slipknot and have not been since their self titled album.  This is a good album, but I think it's a little too similar to the last one.  I think the second half of this album is better than the first.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album and was glad to listen to it for the first time.  I have a hard time comparing the Slipknot albums because the first three all sound different and the fourth one is a little boring.  This album is the same, but it does not sound the same as the other three.  I will probably not buy this album because I cannot stand to listen to it a second time, but I will listen to it again as soon as I get my hands on a copy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first Slipknot album that I have heard and I was pleasantly surprised.  They are starting to sound a little more like Slipknot.  This album is a little more commercialized than the last one but I guess I expected that from this band since they had released three albums before this.  The songs are still great and the production is great.  I would put this album on my top 5 but I think the last two Slipknot albums are better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best Slipknot albums.  It's been a while since I've listened to a Slipknot album, but the other four are on my top 5.  For those who bought Slipknot for the first time this is a great album. The songs are well written and there are few problems with the lyrics. The production is great and the vocals are very good. The songs just move along and do not drag on. This is the best Slipknot album.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album starts off with a good message about a relationship gone sour and eventually a deep depression.  The depression is very well sung and is a nice change from most rap metal albums.  The album then shifts to the "gangsta" side of things and the music is very good. The CD then goes into a slightly different direction for the next few tracks and then changes to "California" and "LA" (more cliche than before).

Amazon review: I've heard one or two albums by this guy and then the whole album by him.  I've heard every single track and have heard the whole CD.  It's a great album.  I like his first album.  He's one of those guys that can create a great song, but it's hard to find him because he's so hard to find.  I also like the fact he makes his albums available for free, so if you're looking for a good rap metal album, here you go.  I only gave it 1 star because it's not a bad album, but not great.  It's not the best rap metal album I've heard but it's not bad either. It's not the worst either.  I still give this album a 5 star rating because it's a good album.

Amazon review :  Overall, I think this is a good album.  He's got a unique sound and I think other record companies should listen to him when he's not touring.  I think the songs on his albums are all unique and I would like to see him on tour again.  I listened to his new album, which is titled "Sons of the Black Sun," and I think he's got the ability to come up with something cool for a great rap metal album.

Amazon review: I really like this album and have been wanting to buy this album since I first heard it.  I liked it when I first heard it, but then I realized it was a great sounding album.  The album sounded like it was made by a band that was very much in the scene.  The songs are great and are all very different.  The album is very well put together and is well worth the money.  This is a great album.  I recommend this album for anyone who likes rap metal.  I would especially recommend this album for anyone who likes rap metal with a sound that is very different from other rap metal albums that have come out in the last few years.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a good album, although I don't like it so much.  It is good.  I like that he is making a new style of rap metal.  I like the first two albums, but when you compare that to this one, it doesn't sound as good.  Overall it is a good album.  However, I think the album could have been better with a few more songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this album is one of the best rap metal albums.  It's a great album, you can tell that he really knows what he's doing.  My favorite song on this album is "My Mind Is Not Your Mind."  He takes the most important part of the song and just makes it a rap metal song.  I like the concept and I love the music.  Overall I give this album a 9.  It's not an album for everyone, but I think this album is one of the best rap metal albums.  I would recommend this album for everyone who likes rap metal.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes rap metal.

Amazon review: This is just a great album.  He has done good songs with great hooks and great lyrics.  I think he is one of the best rap metal vocalists that out there.  I think I've listened to every track on this album and I still think I could get to the end of the album, but I just can't get past the second song on this album, "I Wanna Be Your Home."  I love the song but I think the lyrics could have been better.  The lyrics are good but I think the music is way better.  I think he is a good lyricist, but he needs to work on his music.  Overall, I give this album a 9.  It's a great album.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.

So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have ever bought an album from amazon.  I actually tried this album yesterday and I just didn't like it. I don't like hip hop music...but this album was so overproduced  ( I'm listening to it on my iMac right now) and I just don't think this song could have just been recorded by some computer.  What I really wanted to say was that it was a good song, but it wasn't the great song I was looking for.

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever listened to this song in its entirety.  But I do remember liking the first verse.  I'll give a new song time to grow on me before I give an album I buy a full review.  It seems that most of the reviews here are positive and I don't see why I should change that. It just seems to be the norm, but I think I'm going to give the album a chance.

Amazon review:  I didn't buy this cd but I purchased from Amazon.  I didn't know if I could like the song.  I thought I would give it a try but that was a mistake.  This guy is a music producer and he should have left the beat untouched.  He should have put the song on his own.  I don't know why he did what he did.  I did not like this song.  I'm not a hip hop fan.  I would not buy from this artist.  I don't really understand that.  If he didn't put the beat on his own song, then why did he put the beat on his own song.  I don't understand that.

Amazon review:   I'm not a big fan of hip hop.  I don't believe it has any real creative value.  I don't like the sound of most hip hop songs at all.  I just don't get it.

I don't understand why they write their own songs instead of just using other artists' work, or just using the same song and having it mixed in with another song.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a song to download from Amazon for a while now. I am very very disappointed with the quality of the songs I have downloaded from Amazon.  I've tried downloading songs from different artists but they all sound the same.  I wanted something that was unique to me.  I wanted something that sounded like I was listening to my own voice.  That's why I downloaded this song. But it was just a bad song.  I wish I had never heard the song that I downloaded.  And I'm not saying I will never buy songs again, but I won't buy it from Amazon.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: This is hands down, the best album of 2013.  I couldn't give it a better review than this.  I know it is a little hard to like this album because it sounds like it's been released 5-6 years ago but it sounds like a new band.  It is very refreshing to listen to this album.  It's not a very pop or electronic album, but it is very good.  It's good that it is a compilation.  It would be nice if they put more pop hits on the album, but I don't care.  This album is very good.

Amazon review:- I can't give a good review on this album because it's not a very good album.  This is just a lot of songs that are very similar to songs on other albums.

It should have been louder and a lot more electronic.

Amazon review: I loved his first two albums.  I saw him in concert at the Hollywood Bowl in '94, and the second album I bought was "The Future."

Amazon review: I have not heard this album until now and I have to say I am very disappointed. It has the same old Leonard Cohen sound.
I had heard about the album and had wanted to listen to it since it came out.  I had heard about the quality of the audio and wondered if it would be good.  I was told this was the album that was supposed to be released, so I was surprised when it was not.  I was surprised that it was not released with the rest of his albums.
I love his music, but I am a little disappointed at the current sound quality.  I am not sure why it was not released with the other albums.  It is not like he is trying to make a comeback and put out a mediocre album.  Maybe I am wrong, but I feel it is an attempt by the artist to get back into the music business.  I think the reason he did not release it with other albums was because he did not want it to have the same sound as the first two albums.  It is not that he does not like the album, he just thought that the album would be a little better.  The current sound quality is not what I like.  I thought it would be a little better, but not as good.  I do not understand why he did not release this album with the rest of his albums.  His albums were released in one year so it is a small chance for him to put out another mediocre album.  I wish he would have released the album with other albums.  I am not sure who to blame for this one.  I have been in a long time and I would like my music to have some substance.  I like his music.  I want to hear it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a new record of my own. I also am very interested in this track by Leonard Cohen. I bought it the same day I received it. It is much better than the record company has managed to release it. I am very glad I bought it. I think it is good. I am going to buy the rest of his records. I have read enough so I now want to hear what he has to say. I hope he has more songs available to buy. It is a shame that he would not release this album with other albums.

Amazon review: I just want to say that I love the new album by Leonard Cohen.  I have been a fan for a long time and I really enjoy listening to his music.  I have never heard him in concert, but I have listened to his music on the radio since he was still a teenager.  His music has always been very emotional to me.  I have listened to his music for many years and I am proud of him for it.  I don't think that I would be as happy with another album by him.  I am very happy with this new album.  I just want to say that I love his music and that I listen to it everyday.  I have never thought about how much I miss the old Leonard Cohen.

Amazon review: The quality of the recording is horrible. I purchased this album from the store with two other albums I wanted.  This album was already out there for some time and I had to buy it to replace some unopened albums I have.  The quality of the recording is horrible.  It sounds as if it was recorded by an amateur.  I have to say that I am very disappointed by the quality of the recording.  It is too quiet and it sounds like it was recorded in the 1940's.  It is very disappointing to hear sounds from another century.  This is the first time I have ever listened to a sound that sounds so bad.  I can't believe that this recording is on a cassette tape!  I am very disappointed.  I am happy that I purchased this album.  I would have liked

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

I bought the cd this week and really like it. I would recommend it to any one who is interested in good, clean, traditional, country music. All the songs are great. I would recommend this cd to anyone. I am very pleased with it.

I'm not sure I can be of any help, but I do have a few suggestions:
* I don't like the fact that the tracks are split up between several files, but I'm not sure how to change it.
* I'm not sure why there is a gap between the tracks.
* The cover art is pretty cool, but the song "Love Won't Wait" (which is on the CD) is not. It's one of the better songs on the CD, but it's cover art looks like a cheap-ass cover.
* The lyrics are generally great, but there are a few that I don't agree with.
* The CD opens with a couple of tracks that are repeated a few times. They are not repeated, but they are repeated.
* The song "I Can't Stop" is repeated at least twice.
* The song "Dancing in the Dark" is repeated at least 3 times.
* The song "I Don't Get No Sleep" is repeated at least 4 times.
* The song "Honey" is repeated at least twice.
* The song "Dancing On Air" is repeated at least two times.
* The song "Do You Know What It Means To Love" is repeated at least twice.
* The song "Love Won't Wait" is repeated at least 6 times.
* The song "The Same Old Blues" is repeated at least four times.
* The song "It's the Same Old Story" is repeated at least four times.
* The song "I Can't Stop" is repeated at most 5 times.
* The song "If You're Ready" is repeated at least twice.
* The song "Dancing on Air" is repeated at most 5 times.
* The song "Ain't No Sunshine" is repeated

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: Grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled times it's no suprise. But she finally catches on that there is God who is flow of enduring love. The theme song deputies this in a haunting way.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: As a fan of Slipknot, I had to have this. I just had to have it. The fact that it isn't even the best album the band has made is just sad. I am just glad it is available for those who are willing to give it a chance. To those who hate it, please don't listen to this. I can't believe I have to say this but I can't stand this band.

Amazon review: Wow. You can tell Slipknot was very much into this album, with a heavy feeling that I've not heard from them since Slipknot had a bad year, this is another fine album by a band that deserved better.

Amazon review: This review is the first I have written as a fan of Slipknot. This album shows no signs of improvement. This is a classic case of a band that failed to keep up and instead fell into mediocrity.

Amazon review: This is the first album I have ever bought and it shows what I believe to be a lack of musicianship. I will give this one a 4 because it is the first one I have ever bought in my life but that is it. I don't think this is the best album, but it is one of the best.

### Amazon review: The first time I heard this song was in 1994. I had the cassette. Not even halfway through I realized that it was a Slipknot song. I remember how much I loved this song and still do today. But since then Slipknot has changed so much that this album is completely different from what I remembered. It's hard to listen to it without getting up and walking away. I believe this album is one of the worst Slipknot albums I've ever seen. Not even a single good thing about this album. I'm surprised this album hasn't gotten any higher on the best Slipknot albums list.
