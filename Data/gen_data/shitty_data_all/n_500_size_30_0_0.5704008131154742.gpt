Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

I don't like David Lee Roth.  I hate his music.  But, I'm glad I bought this.  It's not terrible.  It's not great.  It's just a mess.  The worst part is that this album doesn't have any of that great guitar, or vocals.  It just sounds like it was made by a drunk.

Amazon review: I bought David Lee Roth's album at the start of the year.  I didn't know it was a mess.  Now I know.  The vocals are awful.  The guitar is good.  But he's never been a singer.

I believe the original artist, Allan Boles, was able to compose a few great songs, but some of the other songs are not up to par.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: You want a great "Christian" album? Try this.  Great band and song.  Lyrics are not always to be trusted.  But the melody is so beautiful that its not so bad.  I love that the band is in good company like Led Zeppelin and Led Zeppelin.  I especially like the harmonica and the rhythm guitar.  I have to confess- my favorite song is "I'm so happy."  I was totally moved by that one.  Not to be confused with "I'm so happy- I'm" which is the best thing on their live album/DVD.

Amazon review: I like this song because it is a modern interpretation of the older hymn style. The original hymn styles are not that old either.  I like the fact that it is not too religious.

Amazon review:                I love this song.  It has some of the most beautiful vocal harmonies I have ever heard.  The piano/guitar/vocal harmonies are at the top of their game.

I think this song could be used in many different types of worship services.

Amazon review: I am sorry, but this is a non-believer.  This is a very typical "Christian" song.  It is the kind of song that is played at the beginning of all church services.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: I can't tell whether this is a song about a man's lust for his wife or whether it's about a woman whose husband is cheating on her (and/or their sex life is in shambles)?  Does it matter?  This song is just so damn annoying.  I'd like for the song to be about that.  I've heard it a few times.  I'm not bothered.  This one was the most annoying I've heard in a long time.  I like the music, but the lyrics are just plain annoying.  I've heard them several times before.  (I can't help but think that if I were a woman, this song would make me cry.  I can't relate to the guy in the song.  I can't get into his head.  I can't see the world through his eyes.  He doesn't know me.  He doesn't know the only way I'd ever make him happy is to walk away.  )

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this is about a relationship between a man and his wife or a woman being in relationship with a man who is cheating on her.  If it's the former, then this song is about how he's getting the best of her.  It's a song about a woman cheating on her man.  And it's about how she's taking his love for granted.  Ugh.  I think those are the two things that make this song feel like it's about a woman.  (I'm not very good at this, so I don't know.  I'm not really sure what the song is about.)  But it's a good song.  I like the song.  It makes me feel bad for her.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a song about a woman who's husband has left her.  He's cheated on her.  And it's about how she's been taking his love for granted.  I can't listen to this song without feeling sorry for her.  I feel for her so badly.  This is the second song that's made me feel this way.  The first song was called "I wish I was home with you."  (It's a duet with another guy in a band.  The lyrics are about how he feels so bad for that woman.  He wants to be with her.  She's taking his love for granted.  His wife is just ignoring him.  He has such pain in his chest.  He wants to be with her.  She's ignoring him.  He wants to be with her.  He wants to be with her.  She's ignoring him.)

Amazon review: This is my favorite song on the album.  If you can't tell from my review, "Wedding Song" is my favorite.  It's the most annoying, yet the most beautiful song on the album.  It's a perfect song.  The chorus is so catchy.  It's about how he's really happy with her.  It's about the way he sees her.  I just love the way he describes her.  He says, "I like you more each day, and each day I see the beauty in you.  You see it in my eyes, you're the reason that I'm so happy."

It seemed like it was about an unhappy relationship.  I didn't want to listen to that.  It made me feel like I needed to be with that guy.

The first album "The Sound of Jazz" by Frank Sinatra and George Gershwin was released in 1959...which was a year before George Gershwin's masterpiece, "Summertime." The second album by Frank Sinatra and Billy May was released in 1961.  Both albums are excellent but the 1959 album is the better of the two.  The songs on this album are very good.  They were all written by the Frank Sinatra and Billy May.  Sinatra would later write many more songs with Billy May.

Amazon review: This is, of course, a very good album.  Although it may be one of the best albums ever made, the music is not the most important part of this album.

Amazon review: The album starts off with the Dave Clark Five performing "That Old Black Magic" by Louis Armstrong as a duet with the Count Basie Orchestra.  This is followed by a rendition of "Crazy For You" by Sam Cooke.  Then, the Dave Clark Five perform "Someday My Prince Will Come" by the Four Lads.  It's the Count Basie Orchestra performing "Peg's Rag" that really grabs you.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would like to give a positive rating for this album but it will have to remain a negative one because this album is so bad.  The music is so bad that I feel that for the price of this album I would have purchased a CD of random songs from the radio that was on one of the many channels.  This album has so much potential and I would have bought it if I knew what it was.  This album is very similar to the Temptation album in that the music is bad, the songs are very short and are taken out of context.  The only redeeming factor about this album is the name of the band.  The name of the band is "The Prince Collection" and it is very clever since there are so many great Prince songs that haven't been on any recording and are on this CD.  The songs in this CD are all very short and are taken out of context and are used in an attempt to sell this CD.  This is a horrible album that has a lot of potential and would be good if this was the last CD that was released.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great album, as usual, and the artwork is pretty damn gorgeous. The songs are a little hard to get through, I agree, but it's all in good fun, and it's just a really good album.

Amazon review: This is an overpriced, overproduced album. It's just a bunch of songs that are just bad. There is nothing that can be said about it.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music is not good. The song "I'm a Believer" is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. The song is supposed to be a song about religion but it's so bad that I couldn't even understand it. The song was so bad that I couldn't listen to it even once. There were so many songs with the word 'believe' in them and it was just a bunch of bad songs that made no sense at all. The last song, "I'm a Believer", is better, but the lyrics don't mean anything.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album. It's not really Prince, it's just Prince. I thought that this was the most Prince he could do that was not a tribute. The songs are really good. There is a song called "Black Diamond" that is a great song. The song is about a woman who is trying to get over the death of her first husband and it's about a guy who wants to get back with her and they both go to an island and get married.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is no masterpiece, but it's a great album - just listen to the guitar solos and you'll have no doubt.  There's a new age feeling to this album, which is refreshing and welcome.  The songs have a nice swing to them and you can just imagine the guitar solos.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes great rock and blues and can't get enough of it.  If you like acoustic albums you should try this.

Amazon review: This is without a doubt one of the worst albums ever!  It's not that it's bad, in fact, it's pretty good, that's just the way it is.  The worst part is the vocals.  I have an idea about what they are doing, but I can't figure out how to explain it, and I don't want to listen to it in its entirety.  If you're a musician with ears, you can hear the vocals.  If you're not, you'll have no idea what they are doing.  If you're really a musician who has ears, you should listen to this record.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like music with vocals.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times, and I love it.  The guitar playing is very creative and the vocals are beautiful.  I do not understand why people hate this album.  This is one of the best guitar albums of all time, and the best rock-and-roll album ever.  I love it.

Amazon review: If you like good music, and are a fan of the best guitar players of all time, this album is for you.  The guitar sounds so good, and there is so much playing and singing on this CD, it's just not possible to listen to it and not love it.  The guitars are so good, they deserve to be played by other guitarists, not just the usual suspects.  The vocals are superb.  The lyrics are spot on.  If you are a fan of good music, this album is for you.  If you are not, you are not missing much.  This album is great.  This is one of the best guitar albums ever.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Beatles since my first exposure to them in 1967 when I saw them in Liverpool, and I have been a fan of their albums ever since.  I was a regular in the Beatles Fan Club, and I played many Beatles songs in my early bands.  The Beatles were already one of my favorite groups, and I have been a fan of them ever since.  They are the greatest group in the world, and this album is fantastic.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I wish she had released an album like this in the past, before the success of her latest album.  This album is very different.  This is not the same song as her previous albums.  The songs are not the same either, and she sings them differently.  The vocals are not as good as on her other releases.  Although, the songs are great, and the vocals are great.  I wouldn't compare this to earlier albums.  I feel that this is the best album she has ever released.  I am glad she is going back to her roots, and releasing a true musical masterpiece.

Amazon review: I like the song "If You Go" but I don't think I would ever listen to another song by this artist.  I like the ballads better but this song should have been one of the ballads on her last album.  This is not a commercial pop record.  I don't know why her record company did not choose another artist to do her song.  I do like the rest of the album.  This is the only album I have ever bought.  I have been a fan of hers since she was on Saturday Night Live.  I bought the album in a record store that was a little out of the way, it was not in the main part of town.  I had to drive down to the main part of town to buy it.  You can't buy records in book stores anymore.  I have been a fan of the singer and her songs since she was on Saturday Night Live.  I have been a fan of the singer and her songs since her last album came out.  I have been a fan of the singer and her songs since I was in high school.  I have been a fan of the singer and her songs since my parents got me a stereo cassette tape player in 1986.  I have been a fan of the singer and her songs since they were on Saturday Night Live.

I was a huge fan of her earlier albums, especially "The Streisand Album" and "A Love Supreme" but I didn't care for any of the other albums she released until this last one came out.  I liked this album better than her other albums.  I don't know why but when I was young I listened to a much more recent album than any of her previous albums.  I don't know if that makes me a big music snob like some people who have a problem with her music but I like her music much better than her recent albums.  I really enjoyed this album.  I think it would be a good album to have for my collection.  I like the songs and the vocals are good.  I really like the ballads and the songs that are not pop songs.  The songs are not the same as the songs that were on her other albums.  The songs are not the same.  I think this album was a good choice for her to take a break from her career.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was looking for "new and exciting" at about $13.99 and this was it.  I bought it because it was $14.99 and it was not new and exciting.  I bought it (it was a gift for my son).  So I have no idea what was going on.  I have not seen the show (it was in Chicago) or the artist.  Maybe it was a performance or maybe he was not the artist and he came to the show as a stand in.  I have written a review about it which I am submitting for review.  I am very disappointed in how much that the artist is charging for this piece.  Who does he think he is, I mean who does he think he is?  He is not the artist.  He is not even the artist!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wish I could say this was some sort of a "love letter" from a "great artist" but it was not.  It is an interesting listen, a compilation of songs and some of them are quite interesting.  But the problem is the songs are in 3 parts and there are only 2 tracks for each of the parts.  They are all very easy to hum along with, but if you really look at the lyrics you will see that most of the songs have a very strong religious message in them.  I am not sure I would want to listen to them all on a single CD!  But it is a good CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD was "inspired by true life events" and the artist is entitled "The Artist".  It is not a very good CD, but if you like what he is doing it is a good CD to have.  I thought it was fun and a good listen to,  but I would not want to have it all at once.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like a lot of the songs on this CD.  And it is "artistically" produced.  But the songs aren't very well done.  But it is worth having and I think most of the songs are good.  I think that it is a better CD than most people will get.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a "new and exciting" CD from the "Artist".  I would have to say that there is no Tom Waits.  I did not hear a Tom Waits song on the CD and there was no Tom Waits at the show.  I have to say that it is very hard to listen to the first part or two of the show because of the silence between songs.  I would not buy this CD unless they made a second CD or put it on a tape and I would prefer it on a cassette.  I would say that this CD is in my top 10 of CDs I have ever bought.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not sure what Tom Waits is doing.  I am not sure if he is doing it with the band.  All I know is that he is doing it.  And I like it.  I am going to buy it.

Amazon review: I love the music.  There is nothing really bad about this CD.  I am looking for a CD that I can sit and listen to without having to think.  So I will be buying this CD.

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review:  I have to agree about the Dave Clark Five.  I didn't find them to be my favorite Dave Clark Five.  Maybe that's because I don't know too many of their songs.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I bought this as a gift for someone and had it for 3 days when I received the package and put it in the box. The tracks were pretty good, but the audio quality was terrible.
