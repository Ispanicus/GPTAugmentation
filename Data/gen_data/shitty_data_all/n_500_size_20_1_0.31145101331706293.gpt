Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

From the author of the book, Josh Groban, music biographer, songwriter, actor and singer, comes the first book-length work about his life and music, including his early years in New York City, his early days in the United States Navy, his career as a Broadway performer, and the music industry.

The author of the book, Josh Groban, music biographer, songwriting, actor and singer, brings us the first book-length work about his life and music, including his earliest years in New York City, his early days in the United States Navy and his career as a Broadway performer. He tells the story of how he grew up in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, and how he overcame that to become a singer, songwriter, actor and recording artist. He also describes his love of jazz and how he made it his life's work.

In this book, Groban tells us about his musical heroes, from the greats like Frank Sinatra to the contemporary artists like Stevie Wonder; and he tells us of his own life, his own hopes and fears, the lessons he learned from his father and the love and support of his family. In the course of telling the story, he also gives us a lot of information about his life in the music business.

When Groban was a young child, he was taught that he was different. "There was an element of sadness in me that I didn't understand at the time. I didn't like being called 'different.' I didn't like being told that I wasn't normal. It was something I never was able to reconcile with my own self. I'm not sure I ever did." As he grew up, he came to know himself and his father's feelings about it. "My father and I never spoke about my feelings about being different. We never talked about it. It was never a topic of conversation."

In his late teens, Groban, his father, and his brother moved to New York City. "We were always moving around, and it was in that period of time that I began to explore the world through different avenues of art. I began to write and perform and to play instruments. My brother, who was eleven years older, was working in the theater. I was doing a lot of acting, but it wasn't until I was seventeen that I really began to get into writing and performing."

Groban was a very active performer in the theater, but it was a performing experience that was crucial to him. "I was in a Broadway musical called The Sound of Music. I wrote a song for a character called Bernadina. She was a young girl who was going to a ball in Austria. I wrote a song that was about a ball and how it was different from a concert. The song was performed by a young girl with a flute, and I was in the audience singing it with her. That was my first real experience with performing."

"I think it was when I was in the military that I really began to write for myself. I began to write in the evenings and in the weekends. I was writing music in my free time. It was very important to me that I wrote and that I began to write without any expectations. I would write my favorite songs and I would write lyrics and

Amazon review: If you are a fan of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, then this is the perfect album for you.  There are many great tracks on this one, and this album will please all musical tastes, from Beatles fans to rock fans, to anyone who likes a good melody.  I think that this album is worthy of its price and that makes it even more desirable.  The only thing I would have changed is to have had the lyrics printed right on the sleeve instead of being in a small box.

Amazon review: If you have a fondness for the Beatles (or any other British band), this is a great (and affordable) purchase.  I bought this album thinking it would be a great introduction to the band, and if the collection of songs worked (as it did for me), I would have continued with the purchase.  This album is just what I needed to introduce myself to the Beatles, and I am sure I will continue to purchase more of their albums for my collection.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

The song has been on my iPod since I was a teenager and I've been listening to it in my car, while I'm driving, and while I'm working out. It's always in my car.  My husband says I sing it in my sleep.  I'm sure I do.  I also love a lot of other Italian songs from the 1960's, 70's, and 80's.  "Veni Sante Spiritus" is probably the most important of them.  The song will always stay with me.  It's my song and I will always sing it.  It's my husband's and my favorite song.

Amazon review: Chris Tomlin has been a Christian since the late sixties. He first started singing in a band called The Rocking Pines. The band only lasted for two years, but had a big impact on Chris Tomlin's life. Chris Tomlin went on to form a band called Bethel in 1971, which lasted for another three years. In 1974, Tomlin released a solo album called Bethel Road. The album was very well produced. The songs were all about Jesus and how to be a Christian. The album was very well received by the public. In 1976, Tomlin went on to release another album called Bethel. This album was very well produced. The songs were all about Jesus and how we should live our lives. In 1978, Tomlin released his first album with this cover art, which featured Jesus on a cross. He went on to release a CD in 1997, which had a cover art that was very different from his other CDs. The album was a good album, but it wasn't the best. In 2001, Tomlin released his third album with the same cover art, which featured his picture in the center, and Jesus on a cross on either side. This album was a great album that had a great message. It was very well produced. The songs were all about Jesus and how to live our lives. The album was very well received by the public. In 2002, Tomlin released his fourth album with the same cover art, that featured him sitting in the

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best version.  I am a fan of the original version and am not a big fan of this one.  The original version is better in every way.  The other three versions sound like they are from different eras and not from the same era.  This is a masterpiece of the mid-2000s.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The original version is a classic, but I prefer the version by the All-American Rejects.  The original has some interesting lyrics, but this version is much more upbeat and melodic with a more modern sound.  This version is the perfect rendition of the song.

###
Amazon review: I love the music.  I love the production and the lyrics.  This song is definitely not for every person, but I have to give it points for being an excellent soundtrack to any music video, especially one that is just about a young man leaving his hometown and moving away from everything.  The song itself is very catchy, but the lyrics are not particularly profound.  I don't understand the song's message, but I truly enjoy its music.  If you enjoy this version, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys the original.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best version, but I have to give the original more points.  The song is great, but the lyrics are not particularly profound.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The original version is still the best.  The only thing that I don't like about the original version is that there is no real chorus at the end.  The verse is very short and the chorus is a little weird.  The bridge is also a little weird, but the song is definitely catchy.

Amazon review: This song holds a special place in my heart.  The original recording was released by Capitol Records.  It was made by a group called "The All-American Rejects" and is a classic rock-based folk song that was originally written by Bob Dylan.  It was originally recorded by Bob Dylan, with the vocals sung by Linda Ronstadt.  It was later covered by several other performers, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, the Animals, and the Beach Boys.  It was actually written by the Beach Boys' Mike Love in 1968 and was recorded by the Beach Boys in 1972, but it was never released until the 1983 compilation album, The Beach Boys.  The original version was released by Capitol Records as a single and reached the number one position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.  The song was also featured on the soundtrack to the movie, The Blues Brothers, and was the theme song for the TV series, Beverly Hills 90210.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I have used it in the car & on the way to work for the last 4 years. When I am listening to it, I am not thinking about the road or the traffic. I am just listening to the music.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this cd since I was 5 years old. I have gotten several cd's of this, one of which was the first one I ever own. This year I bought the same cd, only this time I got the new one. It was worth every penny. The songs are great. I have heard other cd's of this band, but with the other cd's they did not have the same sound. This cd has a great sound.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very disappointed in this CD. It is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many songs, too annoying to listen too.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this singer/songwriter. I've never heard of this group until I ran across them on the radio. I found the CD by accident and was blown away by the way these songs sound. I haven't heard any of the other albums, so I can't compare the quality of the songs, but the vocals are just as good as this CD. I'll be buying the next three CDs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very good cd with some really good songs. The only thing I don't like about this cd is the fact that some of the tracks are only played once, and they get repetitive. It's not bad, it's just that I had to skip the track on "In the Midnight Hour." The song is great, but it's better for listening to it once.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.  I have never heard anything like it.  The songs are deep and well written.  If you are looking for a nice listen and don't want to spend too much and don't want to buy the cd, you should buy this one. I love it. I bought the cd because I really like the songs and I wanted to hear the cd before I bought the cd.
