Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Twiztid is one of the most underrated musical acts to come out of the mid-80s East Coast. In their early days and days of the recording studio, there was no way that the group could do anything but play rock at all times. Then they learned the art of sampling, making their own music. Twiztid is a band that has a sound that is unique and different from others, but they also have a sound that is very very tight. They mix their influences from hip-hop, rap, rock, reggae, and dubstep. Twiztid has been around since the early 80s and this is their second album, their first being the self-titled album in 1993. With each new album, Twiztid has put out great music that is full of energy and good music.

Amazon review: This song is a little different than the rest. Like some of the other songs on this album there's a lot of singing but this time it's done by a female.  There's also a lot of dancing and even though it's not really a song, it's not really a song that I would call a ballad either.  The real song is the one that comes after, I guess this is supposed to be a ballad but it really isn't.  It's a really fast paced song with lots of dancing, it's also kind of cheesy.  I'm not a big fan of this album.  The singing isn't that bad but the singing is pretty bad.  The singing is not bad, the dancing is not really good either.  It's just the singing that I don't really like.  The dancing is not bad, it's just not that good.  This is not a bad album, the dancing is okay.  It's just like other songs on this album, it's good and entertaining but it really doesn't make the album "good."  I will be buying this album again when I have a few more dollars to spend on it.

I think she is so talented and I'm sure she'll be great.  She's not going to be a huge pop star or anything like that, but, I think she's going to be one of the best new artists out there.

Amazon review: Great CD.  I like it a lot.  Meghan Trainor is one of my favorite artists, but, this is just not one of her best songs.  I'll have to listen to it again before I decide if I like it or not.  I really like the song, "Forgotten Girl".  The video is very funny.  I don't know, I just like the CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

It is not just a singing exercise, but a way to discover your unique voice and to build a foundation for singing. I like to sing a lot, but I definitely don't sing opera.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The only thing that I can complain about is that there are a couple of songs on the cd that sound like the band is having to rush through a couple of verses in the chorus to get them to sound right. I guess this is par for the course for rock-n-roll, but in the case of this album, it'd be nice to hear more of the "real" song before the "filler" songs get in. Just a little nitpicking, but it's something I'd like to see fixed.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I did like the CD.  It was good, with good vocals.  The production was good, and the songs were a lot of fun.  It just wasn't what I was expecting from the CD.  I think I'll buy a second copy.  Some of the songs I've never heard before, and I like them.  But overall it wasn't as good as the other CDs I've heard.  I don't think I would buy this again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the songs, but the cd is short and the CD is boring.  It is a shame because the first half of the cd are really good.  I like "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" and "Manhattan Transfer" and the songs "No Matter How You Do My Heart Will Always Dance".  "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" is nice, but the chorus is annoying.  And the song "No Matter How You Do My Heart Will Always Dance" is nice, but it is also annoying.  I don't know what I like about this cd.  I like the songs and maybe they should have an extended cd.  But maybe that's just me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is only one song that I like.  It is "Manhattan Transfer" and I like it because the song is a big hit.  But it is just boring and the lyrics are just generic.  I don't even know the lyrics, there is so much stuff in the song that I don't even know what they say.

And I think the song "No Matter How You Do My Heart Will Always Dance" was a hit, but there is so much stuff the song "No Matter How You Do My Heart Will Always Dance" that I don't know what they say in the song.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why they call this song "Bruja" I thought it was supposed to be some kind of "Latin" thing.  I don't listen to Latin music, so it doesn't interest me.  "Bruja" is the one good song on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Oh, I really like the first half of this album.  The second half is just... blah.  I have no idea what it is supposed to be about.  It is just repetitive and annoying.  I was really hoping it would be different from the first half.  Now I have to listen to the first half over and over.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just want the music of this album to be on a CD.  But it isn't.  I don't know why they did this.  All I have is this one song.  The tracks that I liked don't even make it onto the album.  I like the first half of the album, but the rest are just... blah.  Now I have to listen to the first half over and over, and listen to the second half over and over.  This is going to be a long, long while until the CD gets here.  Thanks for the music, but it's just not worth it.  I don't really care about anything else on the album.  If I could, I'd just delete.

Amazon review: This song is one of the worst songs I've ever heard.  The lyrics make no sense.  The song is about how people who don't have any money get raped by a prostitute.  I don't think that's a good idea.  It's one of those songs that makes you want to scream.

Music: "Cadenza"

I don't know why I bought this CD.  I didn't like it.  It would have been better to purchase the CD and get the songs I liked.  I had to listen to it over and over.  This CD is just not worth it.  It's not even worth buying on it's own.  It's like buying a CD of an album that isn't even worth buying on it's own.  And I'm not even a fan of rap music.  I don't care much about rap music, so I don't know why I bought this CD.  The only thing I like about this CD is the "Cadenza", but I don't know how it is suppose to be a "R&B" or "Latin" song.  This song is not any good.  I don't like the "Cadenza" at all.  I don't even know what it is suppose to be about.  It's just annoying.  It's the one song on the CD that I like.  I like the first half of the album, but the rest is just blah.  I don't know why they call this song "Cadenza".  I thought it was supposed to be some kind of "Latin" thing, but it doesn't interest me.  This song is the only good song on the album.  The tracks that I liked don't even make it onto the CD.

Music: "I Just Wanna Be Your Man"

I don't know why I bought this CD.  It was almost full price, so I decided to get it.  But I don't like it.  I would have been better off buying the CD that had the songs I liked, and then getting the songs I liked instead of buying this.  This is a really bad song.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of classical music. I have enjoyed listening to and learning the works of composers such as Beethoven, Bach, Mozart, and others. I have never seen one of these albums. So, I searched for this CD and found that it was available over at Amazon.com. I also purchased this CD and read the fine print. I was delighted to find that I could return it for a full refund. This was a great deal.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I would like to suggest this CD to anyone who is looking for a good pop album.  I know that the music is not going to be to everyone's taste, but I like it.  I would also like to mention my father who was one of the first to buy this CD in the past.  I hope this is the last time I have to tell him about the CD.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a pretty good CD, but it has a few things that I have to comment on.  The first thing I have to say is that I am going to miss the CD that I first heard - Revel.  I think that is one of the best CDs that I have ever heard.  The second thing that I have to comment on is that the CD that I have never heard before - Casting Crowns.  I love the CD but I am going to miss the CD that I first heard.  The third thing is that the CD that I have never heard before - Title.  I think that the CD that I have never heard before - Title is going to be a big hit.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have nothing to say about this CD, it's like the CD that I have heard 10,000 times over the last few months.  I wish the CD that I have never heard before - Title would have been better.  I would like to comment on the CD that I have never heard before - Revel.  I still listen to it every now and then, but I'm not as crazy about it as I was when I first heard it.  I don't know why, but the CD that I have never heard before - Title has my full attention.  What's good is the CD that I have never heard before - Revel has my full attention.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Not only is she a very sexy woman,  which I know so many women on the streets and in the workplace think she should be,  but she also has a beautiful voice.
