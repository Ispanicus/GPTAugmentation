Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my mom as a gift for her birthday. She loves to sing and has always enjoyed listening to music. The CD was perfect and I was very happy with the purchase. The songs are all very familiar but when the chorus starts the music changes. There are no words or lyrics on this CD that I could identify so it was difficult to sing along. I did enjoy the songs and would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple CD and easy to listen to.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

I would not recommend this album unless you are very, very careful.

Amazon review: I just heard this today and it's awesome.  This album is the best one Eminem has made.  It is very creative, very well written, very well produced, and very different from anything he has done in the past.  I also like how his voice is very different than it's ever been.  The lyrics are very clever and original.  The one song that stands out the most is the only song I really liked which is "My Name Is" I thought it was a really great song.  The album art is very cool.  The only thing I would like to see Eminem do is have the album on cd.  I would like to see him do it with the original album cover.  I would like to see him do it without the stupid cover.  I would like to see him do a couple of songs with different lyrics.  I would like to see him do an album with the songs "My Name Is" and "My Name Is" without the other songs.  I would like to see him do an album with the songs without "The Way I Am" and "The Way I Am" without the other songs.  I would like to see him do a album with "The Way I Am" and "The Way I Am" without "The Superstar" without the other songs.  I would like to see him do the album without "No Love" and "Get It Right" without the other songs.  I would like to see him do it without "The Superstar" without the other songs. I would like to see him do an album without the songs "The Way I Am" and "The Way I Am" without all the other songs.  I would like to see him do an album without "The Way I Am" and "The Way I Am"

Songs: "My Name Is", "Nappy Head", "The Way I Am",

"The Way I Am" & "The Way I Am"

Review:

Eminem has said that he is looking for a way out and that he has become a "different artist" and that he wants to get rid of the mainstream artists and the mainstream rap music and just get back to his roots. He was referring to the "Nappy Head" song and "The Way I Am", which he says are his 2 personal favorite songs.

I really don't understand why people are so

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have a CD that is a compilation of jazz recordings made in the last decade.  I would like to share with you a sampling of the most excellent recordings from this CD.  I've listed only those that I have played and would recommend as the best of the CD.  I've added a listing of the CD's in the "credits" section.

Amazon review:  I am a lifelong jazz fan,  but  I think I have finally found a  jazz label that I can get behind.  I am always looking for new jazz recordings.  The most recent release from the label is  the CD by "The Last One",  which is an EP by a trio of musicians who play jazz music and  sing.  I have played this CD many times and I can tell you that the vocals are excellent,  it is the best jazz-influenced CD I have heard in a long time.  I would definitely buy this CD again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It is the only jazz album I have ever bought. I have listened to it so many times that I have a hard time remembering just what it was I bought it for. I believe it was for my wife, but the label was different. I have listened to this album over and over. The vocalist is a fine singer and the album is so well done and has so much life to it that I have come to feel that it is worth paying $10 for.

Amazon review: This album  is a collection of the best jazz recordings of the last ten years.  I played a great deal of this music before I heard the CD, and I'm glad I did.  I bought this album in 1998  while I was in  Paris studying  history and art.  I returned the CD to the store  and never looked at it again.  While I was in Paris I  met a man who shared a passion with me for jazz.  I played several of the jazz CDs he brought back with him and one of them was this album.  I was blown away.  This album has the best jazz I've ever heard on record.

Amazon review:   At the beginning of this month, I purchased a CD by   "The Last One". I had heard   "The Last One"  and thought it sounded like   "The Last One"  but   "The Last One"  sounded more like a jazz trio than   "The Last One".   "The Last One" is  so   different from   "The Last One".  I bought this CD   because I was               .

I know               "The Last One"        is a               jazz album              by               a jazz              trio of              musicians.              I              have              listened to "The Last One"          for     almost          24              years              and              would

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I have listened to his music for years and I can say that not one song has been played for me in the last decade that doesn't touch me in some way. I am not a fan of the "bubbly" pop sound that is so popular today. I like r. Kelly's vocals, and I like his lyrics. I like that he has a more mature sound than most artists today. I like that there is a lot of percussion in this song and I am not used to it. I do not like the new style of pop music. I like that he has a deeper sound than most artists. I like that he has a mellower tone of voice. His lyrics touch me in so many different ways.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I have to say that their sound is very different from many other bands this genre is made up of, and it is not for everyone, but I am a fan.  I am going to buy their next album, which is still on my list.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band for many years.  I bought their first album when I was in 8th grade.  I would have bought the second one but I didn't have enough money.  I would have bought the third but I didn't have enough money.  I would have bought the 4th album, but I didn't have enough money.  I have been hooked ever since.  I have to say that their music is very different from the other bands from this genre that are out there.  The band is made up of two guys:  bass player and guitarist.  They have a lot of different musical influences that they use for their music, and it's not country either.  It's like rock, so it's not country.  It's pop, which isn't the most popular music.  It's also not what you would expect from a band that's made up of two guys.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I started to think that there may be a lack of musical talent in the Libera family.  One of the boys got sick just a few days before the album was released and has been diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that is usually passed on in an autosomal recessive manner.       I believe that they should have spent more time on quality control while recording the album because this album is flawed.   They have a huge lack of musical talent in the Libera family.  They should focus on more of a traditional jazz-rock sound.

Amazon review: I found it to be a very interesting album, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I thought the only thing that was missing was the "Fellini" song.  I believe that if you want to be a jazz artist, you have to be able to compose your own music, and if your music is better than someone else's, then you should be able to take it to the next level.    I also believe that if something is written down and made into a song, it is better than something made into an album.      So this album is a must if you are a jazz artist because there is nothing else like it out there.

I don't understand how the trumpet is the lead instrument on this album, it's not!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music was not as good as the movie but it's not terrible.  I found it to be very interesting.  Although it was a lot longer than the movie (8:30), it was also very short.  I liked that it had a lot of scenes that had a lot of music and a lot of dialogue.  The movie is not bad but the music really doesn't do it for me.  I feel that it would have been a lot better with a good soundtrack.

It's so good that I can't believe I didn't know about them before.  It was a big surprise.  It is all the better because of the brilliant and thoughtful lyrics and harmonies by Lin Manuel Miranda.

The only thing I don't like is that I thought the ending was a little "cheesy" but, that's not the fault of the movie, that's the fault of the music.

I'm glad I have this CD.  I couldn't help but smile when I heard the second track.  I don't know what this guy has been doing for the last 10 years but I am very glad that I found him.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I really like this album (and Jewel is a great singer).  It's nice to know there is an album out there that is a great mix of pop/rock.  I'm not sure if Jewel is a good singer, but I really like her voice and I love the music she can sing.  I don't know too much about her, but I think she has a great voice and a nice voice.  Jewel was able to fit the music that she sings to the lyrics.  She can sing in any key, but I think that in the pop rock world it is just difficult for her to sing a song that is in a range that she can sing well.  I think that there is a lot to learn about her and I think she'll get better.  Jewel has talent and I hope that she continues to grow and develop her talent.  Here's hoping.

She doesn't have a bad voice.  She can sing in any key.  I don't know a lot about her but she has talent and she is very nice.  I think she needs to keep singing and doing better.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I love the album.  The song "All Around My Way" is my favorite song on the album.  Also, the song "Good Time" is awesome.  However, I do not believe that the album deserves a 5 star rating.  I don't think that they are trying to be "hip-hop".  I honestly think that they are just trying to copy the styles of their peers.  I really hope that they release more albums in the future because they deserve a lot more attention and support.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
