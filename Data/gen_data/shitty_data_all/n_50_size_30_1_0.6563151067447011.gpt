Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is an amazing cd. It is very well done, and features some of the best singers out there. The music was definitely the best part of this album.

Amazon review: When I first heard Jewel’s music, I didn’t know what to think. I was listening to her music and thinking “Wow, really? Does she really sing that stuff live? Can she really sing that music live?” Then I listened to her music, and I was blown away. I am a fan now, and I have listened to her music for several years. She is an amazing artist. For every song of hers you hear, there is a story behind it. It was definitely a pleasure to listen to. She is definitely one of the best singer/songwriters around.

Amazon review: This is a good CD. There are a few songs that I feel are not worthy of the full, deluxe version that comes with the CD. But overall, I would say that this is a good CD, and I would recommend it to others. I would say the CD is worth the money and time you put into it.

I think that she is the best out of all the artists I’ve listened to.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It's very beautiful and very relaxing.  The vocals are clear and sound real.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is because it had a few problems with the CD.  One of the CDs songs is scratched and it's not a problem.  The other songs are fine.  I wish the only problem with this CD wasn't that it's scratched.  I love the music, but I wish it was not scratched.  I don't want to pay $2.99 to see if the CD is scratched.  I wish the songs were not scratched.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

For all intents and purposes this song is just an average song.  It's not bad, but it doesn't really shine.  If you are looking for a great song to listen to one night, this one is for you.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is now a tradition to review albums by artists that we have not heard.  I believe there is a place for that in the world of music.

It is not a very good album in my opinion.

Amazon review:  It's a band from back in the day.  They have recently been playing alot of shows and they are on a roll.  I know that I was not impressed or surprised that they can play.   But what I am surprised by is how little they play.  They don't play much at all.  They play slow ballads and the occasional mid tempo songs and nothing else.  It is not a bad thing but maybe it is the way it should have been.  I do not understand why they released this album as a CD.  It is a poor quality CD.  They should have released it as a vinyl version or as an MP3.  Some of the songs have no vocals on them at all.  No one should be surprised by this band.  They are no different than any other band.  They just do it a little differently and some of the songs are great.  The songs "Hollywood Babylon" and "Let It Go" are my favorite songs.  The album "The Other Side" is very good.  There is a lot of energy in the music.  The first song "The Other Side" is very good.  The rest of the album I do not like.  They don't know how to play.  It is very different from their previous work.  I would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Amazon review: I have seen a lot of bands come and go in the past few years.  This band has been around for well over a decade.  It has gained more and more traction and is starting to get bigger.  I hope that this band continues to grow and does well.  We have come a long way in the short time that this band has been around.  They are on the same level as any other band.  They just do it differently.  Some of the songs sound good,  some of the songs sound bad but they do not sound like parody bands.  The band does not sound like parody bands.  Everyone knows that it is a parody band.  I do not have a problem with it.  I just have a problem with the band.  I do not like hearing that band over and over again.

About the song "I can't take it anymore"

I can't take it anymore, can't you see I'm crying. I can't take it, I can't take it, I tried to take it once, but I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore.

The lyrics of I can't take it anymore are a little off. I didn't find that song very appealing. I don't like the idea of someone crying over something so insignificant as a drug habit. It would be better to have someone cry because of something meaningful. I don't find the song that bad. I just don't think it is a great song, but some people like the song.

I have not listened to the other songs, so I can't comment on them. I would give this album a positive score, if it was me.

I am not the greatest singer in the world, but I can sing. For me at least. I have a pretty good voice, and

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I don't know why I haven't been able to find the review.  I would love to read it.
I'm going to talk about the CD I downloaded.  It's the soundtrack for the new Broadway musical, Lin-Manuel-Miranda: The Man Who Owns the Night.  The soundtrack is an excellent collection of songs, but it is also a collection of songs that I don't really like.  I don't like most of them.  The only one that I have not heard before is "Your Name."  I don't understand why she is singing about the music.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't understand why she is singing about the words.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

### (This review was collected from a single review)

The first album by Eminem, and for my money the best one of all.
Released in 1998 and he has been doing it for over a decade.
He now works with Dr. Dre, so I guess it's the same thing.
He has a way with words and really shows respect for his fans by doing the best songs he can with the lyrics he has and the melodies he has.
I think he could have made a lot more money since he was a kid, but he had a way with words and made a good album.
This is the best Eminem album.

This was Eminem's first album after leaving Def Jam, and the first album he had since the last album he made with Dr. Dre. The album was released in 1998 and has only sold in the millions, but still the album is very popular and has a lot of his fans.

I love Eminem's music, and I think he is the best rapper ever. So, I have no problem with him working with Dr. Dre and making 2 albums, neither one of which is bad.

This album is a little slow in places, but it's not bad for a Eminem album. The thing with Eminem is you either love the music and put up with the slow spots, or you hate the music and don't put up with it. Either way, this is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone.

I don't

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's not a collection of all the songs you will ever hear, but it's a well put together collection of songs I had never heard before, to help you explore and appreciate the many wonderful songs in the classical tradition.  There are also several pieces I hadn't heard when I purchased the album, and I have enjoyed listening to them throughout the time the album has been on my player.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I have only one criticism.  My only criticism is that I do not understand how you can sing a song with such emotion and still be able to sing it at the level you do it.  I will have to ask you if you are doing it on purpose.  I do not understand how you can sing a song with such emotion and not be able to sing the song with such passion, but at the same time not have the ability to bring the emotion I hear into the song.  For example, when I am listening to this song, I am not thinking about the song itself, but I am thinking about how the song is affecting me.  I am not thinking about the emotion in the songs I am listening to, but about something more than that.  This song is about the woman who is hurting and is asking for help.
