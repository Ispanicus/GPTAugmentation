Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I think I have finally found a musical that I can enjoy and that I can get into this time and time again. I could listen to this music for hours. It's simple, the music is beautiful and the lyrics are simple too. The performances on stage are also amazing. I am very glad that I bought the CD at the beginning of December when it was released for the holidays!

Amazon review: Every Christmas presents has its own unique style. This album had a different look to it and that made it very, very special to me. When I first saw this album on CD I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. I thought it was the best album I have ever heard and I have heard many musicals, but this one was just amazing. The songs are all so lovely and the acting is so very good and you can tell that all the members of the chorus and orchestra are very talented. I would highly recommend the Christmas album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I first heard the song "I Love You" when I was watching "The Love Boat" on ABC. I had never seen her perform, but I had seen her on "The Simple Life" on ABC.

I was so excited to hear her sing the song that I said "I Love You" to myself over and over. I have been a fan since. I love her music and the way she sings it. She is a very talented woman.

Amazon review: I love this album! I don't know much about the story, but it is soooo great.  I love how this album is very personal and very different from any other albums out there!  I really think it's a little bit different than what you usually hear in this genre of music.  It's almost like he's singing the story of how he's living, instead of singing about love, he sings about something that is going to make you think about life and love.  His voice is amazing, I love the way his voice changes from one song to the next, it's like it's telling different stories at different times in his life, it's very unique and very special, i have never heard anything like it.  The music is beautiful, very good songwriting, very good production, there are many songs that are very good, but there are also some songs that are just not worth listening to.  However,  the songs that are worth listening to are the ones that you have to hear, the ones that will make you cry, the ones that will make you smile, the ones that will make you think about life and love, the ones that will make you smile, the ones that will make your heart beat a little faster, the ones that will make you cry, the ones that will make the whole room shake, the ones that will make you feel the most alive, the ones that will make you feel the most alive, the ones you will have to hear, the ones that you will have to hear, the ones that will make you think about life and love, the songs that will make you feel the most alive, the ones that will make your heart beat a little faster, the songs that will make your heart beat a little faster, the ones that will leave you breathless, the ones that will leave you breathless, the songs that will leave you breathless, the songs that will leave you breathlessly, the songs that will leave you breathlessly, the songs that will make you want to dance, the songs that will make you want to dance, the songs that make you want to dance, the songs that make you want to dance and want to make you want to dance, the ones that will make you want to dance, the ones that will make you want to be happy, the ones that will make you want to be happy, the ones with the songs that make you want to dance, the ones with the songs that make you want to be happy, the ones that will make you want t o dance, the ones that will make you want to dance, the ones with the songs that make you dance, the ones that will make you want to dance and want to make you want to dance,  the ones that will make you want to dance, the ones that will leave you breathless, the ones that will make you want t o dance, the ones with the songs that make you want to dance, the songs that will make you want t o dance, the ones that will make your heart beat a little faster, the song that will make your heart beat a little faster, the songs that will leave you breathless, the songs that will make you want t o dance, the ones with the songs t o dance, the ones that will make you want t o dance and want to make you want t o dance, the ones that will make you want t o dance, the ones t o dance, the songs that will make you want t o dance, the songs that make you want t o dance, the ones that will make you want o t o dance, the ones that will make you want t o dance.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

It wasn't until I got to my car that I wanted to come back and listen to it again.  I had the CD in my car and I listened to it over and over again.  My sister is a huge fan and she bought this CD and she gave me the cd.  So it's my gift to her.  I love the music and the lyrics. I love the sound. I love the way she sings and the way she sings.

I know this is old news now, but I heard a rumor about this guy's real name... The one I heard was Jack Kelly. I can't believe I waited so long to hear this guy's name.

I like the cd and the song I had my suspicions about you were right. His name is Jack Kelly, he was a member of a band called The Dead End Kids.

I could tell this was a "classical" album because it was full of songs that had a very "classical" sounding melody to them. The lyrics were also very "classical".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I love the way he plays the piano and he seems to have a very soothing way about him.  I can't remember the first time I heard this song, but I know I heard it while listening to Ray Benson on the radio.  I had to give this CD a try. And I am glad I did, because I have been waiting for years for this song. Thank you Ray Benson and the guys that play with him.

Amazon review: I'm pretty sure this is a rip-off of "The Ballad of Davy Crockett" by Ray Benson, but that's just a hunch.  I have played this CD on every instrument in my house, and it sounds as good as if I had played it on my acoustic.  The singer sounds very good, and the band plays great.  I like the songs very much, and the music is great.  I am a fan of the older Ray Benson, and this is a very good follow up to that.

Amazon review: I have played this CD on my piano, on my acoustic, and on my acoustic again.  It is all the same.  I have liked it, and I feel that it is a great follow up to Ray Benson's "The Ballad of Davy Crockett."  I can't think of another musician who has done this.  He has managed to make the sound of a piano sound like the sound of a saxophone.  I think his playing is great.  The music is very good, and the lyrics are very good.  I am a fan of Ray Benson and his music.  I enjoy his music very much.

I think the songs are all very good, but I think Ray Benson should be praised for his creativity, not his originality.  I would give a 4 star rating to Ray Benson and his music, if I were to rate it myself.  I would give it a 5.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: There are a few songs on this album that are a little too repetitive for my taste but it's not bad.  The songs do have a catchy, almost pop, feel to them.  I'm not sure where the band goes from here but they are a good group to hear.

Amazon review: This album has some great songs.  Most of them are pretty much the same as the others.  There are a few that have a little more of a different sound.  Some of them have a little more energy.  I think they might be able to pull a song out and really make it stand out.  The songs are a little basic at first but after a while the songs start to grow on you. There are still some songs where I don't hear any lyrics.  I don't really like the fact that there is no lyrics or songs to sing along with.  What I do like is the energy the songs have.  There are a few songs that are a little repetitive but it's not bad.  Some of the songs remind me of an early 1990s group such as The Ramones.  It's a little bit different but not bad.  The other thing that I like about the music is the drums.  They have a nice sound to them.  If they change the sound of the drums they would be great.  The best part of the album is that it's a little bit different.  There are a few songs that are not on the album but the first song can be found by searching the internet for "southern rock."  It's not that hard to find.  If you want to hear something different then this is worth checking out.  It's a little bit different but not bad.

Amazon review: This album was pretty good.  I don't really like the music much.  I like the songs that are on the album but they are pretty much the same thing over and over again.  There are a few songs that are good but not all of them are very good.  I think it's a little bit too predictable.  It's not too bad but it's not very good either.  I'm not sure how good it can get.  I could be completely wrong.  I need to hear more of this band's music.

Amazon review: This album is great.  I'm a huge fan of the group.  They are a great group to listen to.  I really like the songs that are on the album.  I feel like I know the group.  The songs and lyrics are great.  I like it when I hear a song from this group on the radio or on the radio station.  I feel like it's more of a band that I have known for a long time.  This album is good and I'm sure it will be one of my favorites.  I don't really like the songs that are on the album.  They are a little repetitive and I don't think they are very good.  The band would do a better job if they would change one or two of the songs or add a few different ones.  This album is a little bit predictable but still good.  The best thing about this album is that it's a little bit different.  There are a couple of songs that are not on the album but the first song can be found on the internet by searching the word "southern rock."  It's not that hard to find.

I'm so sad to see this show on its way to the top. It's been a while since I've heard a classical opera so I was really looking forward to this show, but it's so poor. I'm always disappointed when I hear a classical opera I've heard before. I've never loved or disliked any of his other operas but this one I really didn't like at all. I thought the music was really beautiful but the singing was so bad. It's almost like a really bad movie. It's not the fault of the singers but the composer. I just can't understand why he would do such a horrible job on this. I'd hate to hear it again.

So, this is the opera I was looking forward to most. I thought it would be really beautiful and the singing was very good. It's just that the orchestra is terrible. I was surprised that the conductor could keep the orchestra together for the entire first act. Maybe that's why it's a very long opera. I've heard a lot of opera but most of them don't go for nearly this length.

Amazon review:
I love the music and the singing. It really is a beautiful opera. I really hope that it goes on to become one of the best classical operas. I really hope that it can become a great opera company. I'm really tired of all the classical opera singers that get too much air time but this is really too bad. This opera was really good. I really hope that they just take it out of the opera. I've never really liked the opera singers in the classical opera. I don't like it when they can sing in the same opera. All of the opera singers in this opera just sound like they're just trying to please the conductor. The conductor keeps telling them how they should sing like this but it just doesn't work. It's just really boring. This opera isn't just one of the best classical operas. I think that it's one of the best operas. I really hope that it can become a great opera company that can continue to do great operas. I hope that this opera becomes a great opera company.

Loved this opera. It was beautiful. The singing was amazing and so was the music. I can't believe how bad this opera is. I mean it takes up like 3 acts. I don't know why they can't take out all the pieces and just keep the music. It's really like a bad drama movie. The music is a little boring but other than that I thought it was really beautiful. I loved the way it was sung. I think the conductor should have just sung the music and not have the orchestra play it. He can't do that. I really hope that the opera company that has been doing these opera's just goes to be a great opera company that can continue to do great operas

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I am a longtime fan of Mr. Miranda. I have always been a fan of his work and am happy to see him continue to bring his voice to new audiences. This album is not for everyone (which was one of the great things about the release of their first CD). I personally think the message is the most important aspect of this album; I think that we should all be encouraged to be happy and to be free to follow our true desires and to be able to express them without shame. Mr. Miranda has always done this with his music and now he is doing it with his voice. This album is a great example and it definitely shows his evolution from a gay man into a gay man who loves to sing.

Amazon review: I bought this a few weeks back. It is a beautiful album. I love the songs. I am a classical music fan and it is a real treat when a composer, like Mr. Miranda, comes out with something very different. It would be a real treat if Mr. Miranda also wrote some more opera.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Mr. Miranda and have been for years. This is his first CD since the release of "This Is How You Love Me." I am not quite sure what I expected, but I was not disappointed. In my opinion, Mr. Miranda has been evolving since his first CD. His voice is still the same but it has matured into a more mature sound. He has also improved the writing of some of his songs. And, he has a new sound to his voice, which is not just one of his singers, but his whole instrument. I think that the new sound is one of the reasons why he has received such positive reviews. I also must say that the songs are not over the top. In fact, some of them are very moving. But, there are so many that I have to say that I love them all. I also have to say that I believe that he has a new sound, the same as his voice.
