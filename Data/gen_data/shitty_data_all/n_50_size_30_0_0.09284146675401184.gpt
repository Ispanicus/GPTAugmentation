Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: This review is a little late because the song is only available on this download from Amazon, however, the song is still available in the store and is the same as on this download from Amazon.

Amazon review: First time playing the entire cd and am I glad I did.  It's different than I expected,  but beautiful,  I was worried about this cd at first because it didn't sound good.

The songs are so beautiful and they touch you.

Amazon review: I really bought this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'.  This is a song that I feel is very important to sing in our worship services.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this choral release.  I bought this cd for the whole cd,  so I only listened to the songs that I already had in my cd player.  I wanted to listen to the other songs for myself and for the Lord and not just listen to the songs of the choruses and not the entire cd.  The songs I bought were all the songs that I already have in my CD player.  I was able to listen to the other songs in order of how I feel they fit in to the songs of the choruses.

Amazon review:  Thank you for posting this review, it's very informative and helpful.  I was very surprised that you liked this album.  I have been a fan of Meghan since we were in high school.  I first heard "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" when she was in the middle of a very successful year and I was disappointed.  I then heard the band name and got hooked on her music.  I then purchased her debut, I Don't Wanna Live Forever and enjoyed many of the songs.  This CD is not as good as her debut, but it is still very enjoyable.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Meghan Trainor.  Her first CD was one of my favorites.  I was a little hesitant to listen to her newest CD, because I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  I must admit, this album is very different from her debut.  I really like the styles that she has brought to the table, but I do not think they are all to her liking.  There are some really good songs on the album, but I do not think she has enough to offer up every song on her album.  The album will leave you with a mix of good and bad.  This is a good album, but not one that everyone will enjoy.  One of my favorite songs on the album is the title track, which I think is one of her best songs to date.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this album.  I've had the CD for about a week and I'm still not happy with it. I've listened to it a couple of times, and I just could not get into it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for a studio recording of this for so long. I love Rachmaninoff.  I have the original CD and have been listening to it regularly.  I also have the live album with the band.  These recordings are excellent.  I have been listening to them non stop.  I have the CD of the live show with the full band. The sound quality of these recordings is better than the live album.  I was listening to them in my car and the music flowed into my car through my speakers.  The recording is so vivid.  The music is so fresh.  The instruments are so clear.  And the musicians are so professional.  And the vocals are so crisp and clear.  I can't get enough of this music.  The Rachmaninoff CD is the ultimate  listening experience. I have been listening to it non stop for months now.  For those who don't know, the Russian virtuoso Rachmaninoff is a genius.  He is a superb artist who is truly gifted.  And that's why he is the greatest of all the greats.  The recordings of him are stunning.  The sound quality is better than in the concert.  I love to hear him play.  In this recording there is only one passage that is not clear.  And it is during the "Mazeppa" from the third movement where Rachmaninoff is playing the piano with a very strange sound.  I can hear the piano clearly but the sound quality is very poor.  There is also a passage that I can hear very clearly but it is not clear.  This is very annoying.  I would like to hear better sound quality.  But I have to say that the recording is very close to the live performance.  The audience is clearly heard.  I am very happy with this recording.  I can hear everything perfectly.  And the musicians are clearly heard on stage.  The sound quality is better than in the concert.  The audience is clearly heard.  The recording is very close to the live performance.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  I have a very bad habit of buying bad music, and I am not ashamed to admit it. I am currently listening to "I Want To Scream" in the hope that it will cure the disease. At the moment, I am not enjoying the experience.  The song is okay, but just not my kind of music.  I was hoping for a song that expressed the essence of the human experience, but apparently that is not possible.

Amazon review:  I am in the process of purchasing this cd, after reading some rave reviews of it in the local paper. I have never owned this kind of music before in my life, and I have to say, it is very disappointing.  I am not a fan of the type of music this band plays.  I am more of a rock fan, and this band is not playing rock music; they are playing the same type of music that I hate, and it is annoying.  The vocals are horrible, the guitar playing is bad, and the band is not in sync.  I would not recommend trying to listen to this cd, unless you are going to pay through the nose for it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  If you can listen to music or read music, you will hear something about the fact that this song is a cover of a song by another band. That's all I have to say about this song.  It is not bad, its not good, its not great, and it's not even average.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I really enjoyed listening to this album, I think the CD was more than half of the songs were outstanding.  The vocals are very good, the guitar playing is very good, the bass playing is pretty good, and the drums are pretty good.  There are some good songs on here, there are some bad songs on here, and there are some good songs that are average, but it is not a terrible album.  I am a fan of this band, and I cannot wait to see the band play live in the future.  I can not say how I feel about this album, but I would listen to something else because it is not worth my time to listen to this album.  The vocals are good, the guitar playing is good, the bass playing is good, and the drums are good.  I would recommend this album.  It is a pretty good album, but it is not a great album.  I would listen to something else.

Amazon review: My wife and I both like this album. We're both fans of Danzig and I think it's a great album. The lyrics are very well written and the instrumentals are well performed.

The music is great and I give this CD a five star rating.

Amazon review: There are some good songs on this cd, but I would have to say the one I love the most is The Unholy Sin. I've been a fan of the band since I was a teenager in the 80s, and this is one of the best songs I've ever heard. That's why I am giving this cd a 5 star rating.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought that this was a decent opera that would please most of the opera aficionados.  The conductor, however, was on a mission to destroy the audience.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The conductor was so arrogant and condescending that he was unprofessional, condescending, and unprofessional.  This opera in its entirety would have been a better experience had the conductor been more in control of himself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure why I'm writing this review.  I listened to the entire recording and thought "meh".  This opera is great for those who are looking for a piece of music to give them a jolt of energy, but not something that will make them listen to this piece again.  It's not a bad opera, just not for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is just a really bad opera.  I will try to explain why....
First, the conductor is way too loud in the aria for me to have any sense of the music,  I can't hear it at all.  (This is probably due to the fact that I have a pretty bad hearing.)
Second, the conductor is way too loud in the aria for me to make out the lyrics.
Third, the conductor is way too loud in the aria for me to even attempt to appreciate the music.
Fourth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that the audience is not distracted by the conductor.  As a result of this, the audience is only focused on the aria and is very unresponsive to the rest of the opera.   (The conductor was so loud that he could be heard from the back of the house even with the doors wide open.)
Fifth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I was having a really hard time hearing the lyrics as I was singing them.
Sixth, the conductor is so loud that the audience is not distracting the conductor, so the conductor is able to go on a rant about the opera in general without being interrupted.  (The conductor kept saying "I could not have written a better opera and this is how it turned out." during the aria.)
Seventh, the conductor is so loud in the aria that the audience is very unresponsive to the rest of the opera.  This opera is a lot of fast action in a very short amount of time,  I have to slow down, stop, and think about what is happening,  and then I have to start again because that action has slowed down.
Eighth, the conductor was so loud in the aria that I could not hear the music.  (The conductor was so loud that I could hear the music after he had finished the aria, but after the aria was over I could not hear the music after I stopped singing it.)
Ninth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I could not hear the music. (The conductor was so loud that I could hear the music after he was through, but after the aria was over I could not hear the music.)
Tenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell when the orchestra is playing it.   (The conductor was so loud that I could not tell if the orchestra was playing the aria at the beginning or at the end of the aria,  it was like it was playing both at the same time.)
Eleventh, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell if there are any changes in the music that are not part of the aria.
Twelfth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell how long it takes for the orchestra to play it.
Thirteenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell who is singing it.
Fourteenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot hear the music.
Fifteenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot judge whether or not the orchestra is playing it.
Sixteenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot get the rhythm of the music.
Seventeenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell what is going on.
Eighteenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot hear anything.
Nineteenth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell whether I am singing it or not.
Twentieth, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell where the beginning of the aria ends and where the end of the aria begins.
Twenty-first, the conductor is so loud in the aria that I cannot tell which is the

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
