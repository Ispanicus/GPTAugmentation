Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I was so excited for this release. I had heard nothing but good things about this album. I am so sorry to say, this is a bad CD.  I was expecting "new and improved."  Instead, I found the same old music with better production. The lead single, "When You're Gone," was terrible. The rest of the album was just average at best.  I had no interest in listening to her voice again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is just an average effort.  The song "I Will Always Love You" was very good, but she sings it like she is trying to sing a song from a movie.  The others are forgettable and a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  If this is your first time hearing Jewel then you are missing a big point.  This is a musical artist, not a singer.  The songs on this release are not written by Jewel; they are written by a team of musicians.  This CD should be more like a documentary.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I thought it was going to be a typical punk-rock show, and I was wrong. First off, the set list is fantastic! I love the diversity of songs, ranging from the heavy "I Want To Know What Love Is" to the fun "The Losing End", to the silly "I Love My Dog". It's a great show, and I had a blast. I'm not sure how many people were there, but it was packed. The crowd was very attentive, the MC was very enthusiastic and had the crowd going.

I have a feeling that they will have better songs in the future, but I still enjoyed the show.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: No real songs.  I mean, there's a song called "H.A.M.M.Y" (I'm a Good Man, I'm a Good Man).  Some of the songs are good, but they're only "songs" that you can play during your workout, not songs.  They're not songs that you can listen to and learn from, and I would have liked to hear some of the songs that she sings herself.  I guess it's just a good-time song, and not a real song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a good album.  In fact, I think that most of the songs are great and deserve to be played on the radio.  But, the problem is that she sounds like she's trying too hard and trying to be something that she's not.  She is a very good singer and is one of the best of the early 80's.  But she is not one of the original great female singers.  And she is not the most talented singer.  I don't say that to be mean.  I just want to point out that the music is so much better when she sings by herself.

Amazon review:  I'm a little disappointed in this album.  I was hoping for more songs, but there are so many songs that are good and all do a good job.  I think that the only reason it's not a great album is because it was put together so fast and so many songs are repeated.  There are two songs that are the same, "H.A.M.M.Y" and "I'm a Good Man", the last song in a row that repeats the last song in the row.

Amazon review:  After listening to this CD, I realized that it's not all about Prince.  I could make comparisons with other artists, but what I really like about this album is the fact that it is a mixture.  It is not one particular artist that is the focal point of the CD.  It is a collection of songs that represent the different facets of Prince's music, from the funk to the ballads.  If you like Prince, you will enjoy this CD.  If you are an album collector, you will enjoy this CD.  If you're not a Prince fan, then you won't enjoy this CD.  But, it's still a nice listen.  If you want to be able to say to people "I bought this CD", then you will enjoy this CD.

The problem is that you are using a fixed number of stars:

I would like to suggest to use a variable number of stars, as below:

Wow, this song reminds me of a story I once heard about a young couple who was driving down the highway when they were hit by a car that had a hole in it and they lost control of the vehicle and ended up crashing into a tree.  They were killed instantly and the young man went to the cemetery where he saw a light shining from the tomb of a woman who had died in an accident a few days earlier.  He found out that she was his dead love and he took her out to the cemetery where she was laid to rest.  He found out that if he sang a song, she would hear him and come back to life.  He sang the song and then the woman came back and he was happy.  I think I would like to do this song.  It is very heart touching.  Hasselvander sings the song very well.  His vocal range is excellent.  He just sings the song and you can tell he is very talented.  I give this song a five star rating.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song, but I don't think it's an all-time classic.  I remember hearing it in the 70's, and thinking it was the best song on the album.  Then the record company started a campaign to get the song in every album.  But, if it's not an all-time classic, it's still a great song.  And they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...

Amazon review: Oh man, this is really a great song.  I could listen to it in the car, with the lights off, and the windows rolled up.  In fact, I can listen to it better than my wife's boyfriend.  I will also admit, it's one of my favorite "off-the-chart" songs.  I always liked it, but I was never a fan of the other songs (or the album as a whole).  So, I will now listen to this song, and listen to it again.

Amazon review: This song has been on my list for years.  I just listened to it on the radio today.  I remember it was on the album when it was released and I remember the album cover.  There was a picture of a woman with a cat.  The album also had a picture of a woman with a cat and a man with a guitar.  I could have sworn this was the song, but it was just an impression.  I do remember hearing this song a lot.  I was a big fan of the '80s and loved anything with a soft rock sound.  I thought this song was really cool.  I never really liked the other songs on the album.  I always thought they were a little too overproduced.  This song was so soft.  It was like the most simple song on the album.  I loved it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to go with this one.  Why?  I love this song.  It is the only song on the album that I actually like.  It's a perfect song.  It has a very simple melody.  It just moves along without any emotion.  It's not too over produced.  It's just a great song.

Amazon review: I have never heard this song before.  It is very similar to the song "The Great Escape," which has been on my list for years.  I just listened to it today on the radio.  I think it is a great song, but I was never a fan of the other songs on the album.  I always thought they were a bit too over produced.  This song is so simple.  It has a very peaceful sound.  I think it would be an excellent song for your car.  It would really make your whole car sound better.

Amazon review: My wife and I love this song.  It's our song.  We have listened to this song hundreds of times.  We have even sang it to each other in the car.

Amazon review: This was a really nice effort that I was looking forward to.  I was pleasantly surprised how good it was compared to other albums by Barbra Streisand.  I have been a fan of hers for a long time.  However, this album is very disappointing.  It's much more like a typical "new" album than an old one.  I understand that she is trying to make the record sound new, but it's just not coming out right.  I give it 1 star because it's not much better than another album.

Amazon review: This is not a very good album.  The album is very good, but the song list is terrible.  First off, I wish she had released some newer songs before.  I'm not sure if this is a new album or an old album.  It's not a very good effort and I don't like the song list.  I don't think this effort is very interesting.  There are only 3 really good songs on the album.  The album just doesn't live up to the first 3 songs.  I wouldn't listen to this one again.  I give it 2 stars because it's a good effort, but it's not really anything special.  I wish that she would have released a few more songs before this effort.

Amazon review: I'm sorry to say that this album is a big disappointment!  I was looking forward to this album for a while.  I was a big fan of hers as a kid.  I really liked the album when I was a kid.  My only disappointment is that I don't think this is the greatest effort she's done yet.  She's done some great songs, but she's done others that I think are better.  The songs on this album just don't sound as good as the first few.  It's a really good effort, but it's not very good.  I don't like the song list, and the album just sounds like it was rushed and not very well thought out.  I give it 4 stars because I don't think it's a terrible effort.  There are some great songs on the album, but unfortunately, the album just doesn't live up to the first few.  I don't think it's a terrible album, but I think this album is very disappointing.  I don't think she should have released this album.

Amazon review: I was really excited to hear this album.  However, I don't think that Barbra Streisand has any new or fresh songs on this album.

I'm not really interested in this album, but I don't think it's a terrible effort.  I give it 3 stars because I do really enjoy the first three songs, and I think she has some really good songs on this album.  I give it 3 stars because it's a great effort for her, and it's not a terrible effort.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

###
Amazon review: I was looking for a collection of carols to play at my boyfriend's engagement party.  I thought I would get a CD of the traditional "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", but when I went to the bookstore to buy it, all I could find was "Merry Christmas" sung by a crotchety old man who sounds like he has bad breath and wants to kill someone.  I was hoping for something by a more recent carol, but no such luck.  So I bought this CD.  It is really good and has only one flaw; it is the only CD released by a company in the last few years that has a song entitled "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" which sounds like someone had a conversation with someone (it is too long for a conversation).  I think they should have used it in a commercial.  I am glad I bought this CD.  This is a very personal Christmas album.

Amazon review:
I am a big fan of Christmas music.  I will buy any Christmas CD I hear, and this CD is no exception.  I have listened to it many times, and still find something new to enjoy each time.  I love all the songs on this CD.  I especially liked "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" and "The First Noel".  I also liked "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "In The Bleak Midwinter".  In general I found the CD very enjoyable.  I bought it for my own use, and now I am glad that I did.  I hope you enjoy it too.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I've only just started listening to this album, as I've only been listening to Elvis since I was about 10 years old. I have to say that this is the best Elvis album I have ever heard. When I was young, I couldn't get into the Beatles. Then I came across "Elvis' Greatest Hits" and started listening to it. I think I was only about 13 at the time, and I was completely hooked on this album. When I was older, I listened to "Elvis' Greatest Hits", and I've always liked his voice more than any of the Beatles'. I've been going back and listening to this album for about 10 years now, and I can honestly say that this album is my favourite. The only reason why I don't think I can still call it my favourite is that I think that the album was released in an earlier year than it should have been.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I did not find this song particularly compelling, but I did enjoy the fact that the band had managed to get this down to a decent recording.  It is very similar in sound to the previous song, so I suppose the quality is a bonus.  I found the vocals a little too nasal, but that may be me.  The sound was a little better than the CD I had before, so that is a plus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I had heard this song once before and thought I would rather not hear it again, but I really did enjoy it.  I had a lot of fun.  I even tried to keep up with the band the whole night.

I wish I could have seen the band every night.

Amazon review: Not much to say other than I really liked this song.  It had a good sound to it and had a nice feel to it.  It also worked out well on the radio.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

This product was provided free of charge to the reviewer. This review is in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission Act.

I'm a big fan of Tom Scott, and really appreciate his music. He was recommended to me by a friend after watching a concert I did in my backyard. I love his singing voice. He's been able to produce a lot of albums in terms of songs he's written, and he's able to make them sound great to me.

Pros:
-The songs are a good mix of funk, jazz, and traditional Americana
-The songs are fun and enjoyable
-I like the music
-I like the songs
-I like the singers
-I like the style of music
-I like the feel of the music
-I like the songs
-I like the CD
-I like the cover art
-I like the fact that Tom Scott is a relatively unknown artist but he does what he does well
-I like the fact that he's a true professional musician

Cons:
-This CD doesn't quite hit the right spot for me. I get it, he's an excellent musician and he writes really cool songs, but I just can't get into this CD. It isn't really my cup of tea. The songs are all the same, and the CD is really boring. It's not bad and it certainly isn't too bad, but it just doesn't appeal to me.

Overall:
-I like Tom Scott. I like his music. I like the CD and I think it's really fun to listen to on the go. He's a talented musician and I appreciate him as a musician. I've only listened to a couple of his CDs so far, but I think I'll probably get to more.
-I don't like this CD. It's a waste of money for me.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review:  This is a very good tune I have had for years.  I was looking to add a tune to my cd collection and saw this on sale.  After playing it for a while, I thought it would be a nice addition to my collection.  I'm very happy with it.  I am a big fan of the Bee Gees.  The only thing I have heard of this particular tune is on the song "The Rain" on the Bee Gees album,  which has a similar feel to this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I agree with the reviewer above.  I have a CD from this record that was played at my graduation party.  It had a great sound and I think the songs and guitar playing was extremely good.

I think this is a very good record.

Amazon review:  This record is a great purchase!  To those complaining about the packaging, I think you should see the quality of the actual product.  I could not believe how cheap all this packaging was.  I was so disappointed.  This is a great record, and the package was a disgrace to music.  Not even a CD, just a plastic, boring box.  What a waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I just received my copy of this CD.  On opening it, I was pleased that the box was not so bulky, but when I opened it to look at the CD, I was somewhat disappointed.  The CD was very light and thin and when I opened the case, it was also very thin.  I thought the CD would be too thick to fit in the case.  This is a very good record, but I think the CD is quite large for a CD, and the case is too large for the CD.  I would have preferred a CD case closer to the size of a cassette tape.  I also thought the music had a very different sound than that of other albums.  For instance, I thought the music sounded more like a radio broadcast, and I thought that made it sound more interesting.  I would love to have a CD of this CD, but unfortunately, I don't think it will be possible to get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I really enjoy listening to this record.  I have had it for three years and have listened to it a total of three times.  I like the rhythm and style, but the sound quality gets a little flat.  I think the music would sound better with more bass or maybe some more treble.  I really like the Bee Gees, but I am really disappointed with this one.  The song "In the Garden" sounds like the sound of a radio broadcast, and I did not like it.  I wish the Bee Gees had included more songs that I liked in this album.  I also don't get the song "We're Gonna Change", but that is probably because I have not heard it in a long time.  I really like the cover of "I've Got the World on a String".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I got this as a gift from a friend with a couple of CDs from her library.  Her library has a large collection of music, and I think this is one of her favorites.  The sound quality on this CD is very good.  The music is good and the playing is also very good.  The only thing I didn't like was the recording on "I've Got the World on a String".  It is very quiet compared to other discs I have heard.  So you can hear the quiet parts on this CD a little better.

Amazon review: I have just recently discovered the Grateful Dead. This is one of the best live albums I have heard in a long time. The sound is amazing! The lyrics are amazing. "Truckin" is a perfect album to listen to in the morning or in the evening. In fact, the best way to listen to an album would be to listen to it through your headphones while driving, which is where I was listening to this album. I would recommend this album to anyone, no matter what kind of music they like. I have just recently discovered the Grateful Dead, and this is one of the best live albums I have ever heard! I love the way it is put together

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: The most recent of the "Ecclesiastica" CD's, released in 1999, is a recording of the Bach cantatas including the Christmas Oratorio. The recording is of high quality, excellent sound, and with the exception of the first movement of the Christmas Oratorio, all other movements are in A-flat or C. The recording is a bit on the quiet side, with the exception of the first movement of the Christmas Oratorio. I was not completely satisfied with the recording.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "Ecclesiastica" is a collection of Bach Cantatas, composed of three volumes. Volume 1, Cantata 1, is a collection of six cantatas (I-VI), including the Christmas Oratorio, "Hymnus de Natività" ("Hymn of Nature"), "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" ("Joy of Man's Desiring"), and "Gottes Zeit" ("time of the Lord"). Volume 2, Cantata 2, is a collection of four cantatas (I-IV), including the Cantata "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Volume 1), "Ach, wir denken einander an" ("O woe to us two thinking an each other"), "Gott verlassen uns" ("God leaves us in sorrow"), and "Gott gehört" ("God belongs"), and "Gottes Zeit" ("Time of the Lord"). Volume 3, Cantata 3, is a collection of five cantatas (I-IV), including the Cantata "Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Volume 2), "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Volume 1); "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Volume 2), "Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Volume 1); "Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Volume 2); "Ach, wir denken einander an" (Volume 1); and "Ach, wir denken einander an" (III).

Amazon review: The following is a collection of original works by Johann Sebastian Bach, including his first three cantatas "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (BWV 232), "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (BWV 233), and "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (BWV 234). The three cantatas are also known as the Christmas Oratorio, the Passion Cantata, and the Musical Cantata. The first two cantatas were composed in 1725 and were not included in any of Bach's instrumental works until 1742. The three cantatas were composed in 1700, after the death of Bach's wife, Barbara, and were written for the Christmas season. The cantatas are scored for soprano, alto, and bass with an organ. This recording was released in 2008 through the BISAC Music Master Series.

Amazon review: I have not been able to find this CD. It was sent to me by a friend for Christmas. I'm not sure who the producer was or what the band was. I don't know what the CD is called.

Amazon review: We have a new recording of the Bach cantatas "Hymnus de Natività" (Hymn of Nature) and "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring" (Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring) by the Bach Collegium Vocale. This is an excellent recording and worth the price of admission.

Amazon review: This is a recording of Bach's cantatas. The cantatas were written for the Christmas season and were composed between 1724 and 1742.

The fourth movement is in A flat and the fifth in C major.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a few of 'em around, I can't remember exactly how many, but I think they've got a total of 10 or so.  It all started with this one album, "Punk Funk", which I believe was a collection of ska numbers mixed in with some more rock and some more ska.  One of the songs on this album, "Rise from the Ruts", I remember hearing at a club in my early teens, it made an impact on me that I've never forgotten.  The song has a few references to the movie "Dirty Dancing", but the words don't really carry much. The music is just enough to get out of my head and make it through the night.  I used to play this in my back yard as a kid, it's one of my all time favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I never really listened to punk rock until the mid to late 70's when I was introduced to the bands like Black Flag, the Melvins, Fugazi, etc.  I then began to listen to punk rock more often and this album really helped me see what punk rock is all about.  The vocals are awesome and the music is tight and original.  This album was also a big influence on my current band "The Crazies"
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: What I like best about this album is the overall concept-the lyrics are very powerful and the music is very heavy.  The music can be a little repetitive at times, but it is catchy and the music is pretty good in its own right.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I like the title track, I like "Mama's Boy" and "The Only One" are very good.  I like the cover of the Melvins song "Gimme Something".  I like all the songs on this album and I hope to hear more from them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is by far one of my favorites-a great melodic punk rock album.  I just couldn't get into this album, but maybe that was because it had a lot of filler and I wanted to hear some of the songs I like the best.  The album is a little short at about 24 minutes, and you can hear that.  The songs are well written-great lyrics and great music.

Amazon review: I know I've said it's been a while, but I don't think it's been that long.  It was released in the summer of 1993 as part of the "In a World 2" EP which was a compilation of various artists and bands that came together to do a charity show.  The show was later released on CD.  This album was released after the In a World 2 show and was not a part of the original EP.  I'm not sure what happened to that original EP, but I'm pretty sure I bought this after it was released.  It's a great album that's worth getting, but you'll be lucky if you can find it.

Amazon review: I only have one song off of this album.  It's the first song on the EP-the song is called "Worthless" and I think it's the best song on the EP-I've never heard anything like it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure what's going on, but I got this on the last day for my birthday and it was late.  I tried to listen to it and it was so boring.  I would say that it's a good song but I feel that it's not worth the money.  It's not that I don't like Country music but it's really all the same.  It's not a good song.  I feel like it's a waste of money.  I will not buy this CD.  It's kind of sad.  The cover looks like it's good. You can tell that it's a country singer.  But you can't help but feel that it's the same boring country that you've seen too many of.
