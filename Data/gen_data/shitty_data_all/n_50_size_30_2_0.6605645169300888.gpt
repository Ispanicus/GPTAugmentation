Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to compliment my other CD's I had at my house by the name of "A Place of Grace"  I purchased a few of their CDs here and there and I was in love with them.  This CD however has two things that I don't like and I hope they change their name to "A Place of Love"  I don't like the fact that they don't have any real Gospel and they don't know how to sing "I know you feel my pain" or any other real Gospel lyrics.  I don't like the fact that there is not one single song in the entire album that talks about the Gospel or about the Lord.  The songs are too often sung by the men and not by the women.  I don't like the fact that I don't know if the songs were written by the same person or not.  The songs on this album are very repetitive and have no real substance.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the CD "The Voice of the Church" for many years now and I must say that it is very well done.  I would not mind it as much if it was not so repetitious.

I must say if I could give one star to this CD it would be for the first person who said the CD did not have enough songs and I agree with that statement.  I gave this CD 3 stars because I like the CD and I want to hear more from it.  I have listened to many of the other CDs in the series and I like the series as a whole.  I like the CDs and the series and I hope as the series continues that they continue to improve in quality.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a western swing musical, you don't have to look any further. This is it! This is the best western swing musical I have ever heard and it's only for me. This album is better than the second CD but not as good as the first CD. The first CD has all of the songs that you'd expect to find on a western swing album with a lot of great songs like "In Dreams (I Know) (I Know) (I Know) (I Know)" "Where Is My Mind" "It's Only Make Believe" and "If I Had A Gun" and "It's Only Make Believe", all of which stand out as great musicals. The second CD, however, is a little disappointing with a couple of songs that are just OK. All in all, I would highly recommend this album to anyone looking for a western swing musical. I'm not sure if I am a fan of this cd because I don't know much about the music but I am a big fan of this cd because it is great to have a western swing musical that isn't like every other western swing musical out there.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: A great choice for those who enjoy western music and movies. The two songs were performed by an excellent cast.  The songs, "A Woman's Heart" and "The Ballad of Casey Stegall" were exceptional as they were both well done in my opinion. "The Ballad of Casey Stegall" is a very, very good song. I loved it.

Amazon review: I have to say this CD is one of my favorite jazz albums of the year.  The CD opens with one of the most beautiful tunes I have heard in a long time, "Fantasy In Blue."  This is a very mellow tune, with lots of piano and trumpet and guitar.  This is followed by a song on the same level as "On the Town" by the Rolling Stones, "Gimme Some Lovin'."  I love this tune.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys jazz music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album is a must for any serious music lover.  From the opening notes of the first track, "Presto" to the closing notes of the final song, "Goodnight"  it's a very hard-hitting and dynamic album.

Lyrics to "Halloween" by Alex Lacamore

Well this is a Halloween we'll have a little fun this year
We'll do what we please and we'll see what we can do
This year will be like no other
Halloween
We're going to do what we please and we're going to see what we can do
This year will be like no other

We don't have to be afraid of what's going to happen
We don't have to be afraid of what's going to happen in the night
This year will be like no other
Halloween
We're gonna do what we please and we're going to see what we can do...

You see the lights are on and we're going out tonight
We're going out tonight
We're going out tonight
Halloween
We're going out tonight

I know I've been a real bad boy
And don't you worry about me
I'll do the things I've done before
I'll do the things I've done before
I've done the things I've done before

I know I've been a real bad boy
And don' t you worry about me
I'll do the things I've done before...

You know I've been a real bad boy
And don't you worry 'bout me
I'll do the things I've done before
I've done all the things I've done before
I've done all the things I have done before

I know I've been a bad boy
And don't you worry about me
I'll do all the things I've done before
I've done all the things, I have done before
I've done all the things, I have done before...

You know I've been a real bad boy and don't you worry about me
I'll do the things I've just done before
I've done all the things I've just done before
I've done all the things, I have done before.

I know I've been a real bad boy
And don,t you worry about me

That's too bad, because it is a very good CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I am a little confused, because I thought it was a blues album. This album is not as bluesy as the other two.  The vocals are more of a folk or country sound, but the music is still there.

I like the singing and the music. I like the instruments. I like the instrumentation. This is a very nice album.

Amazon review: Twiztid is an odd group of music.  I'm not a big fan of hip-hop and rap music in general but they have a good thing going.  Even they themselves may not know what they are doing.  The songs are catchy and the beats are strong.  Overall, I think that this group is on the high of great.  I've yet to hear a bad song and I can't wait to listen to their next release, "I'm a Freak"

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I hate to say this because I am a fan of Jewel, but I feel like she is trying to be something different.  She is trying to be a pop star, and yet she is trying to be a singer.  She is trying to be a singer and she is not a singer.  She is trying to be a pop star, and yet she doesn't have good music or good lyrics.  I don't like it.

Amazon review: If you are not familiar with Jewel's voice, you won't like this CD. Her voice is not in your face.  The first song is very good and the last song is just average with some good vocals.  I can't figure out why she changed her name to Jewel.  I like her music, but I still don't like the sound of her voice.  I don't like her lyrics.  She is trying a new style of music and she is not singing her songs.  I don't like her music.  I hate her music.  She is trying a new style and she is doing it badly.  I will continue to not buy her music.

Hall and Oats
This song is from the CD, Hall & Oats. It's a nice song, not really that great, but it is still a nice song. It's one of those very simple songs that goes down easy, but the song is good.

The song is about a high school kid who is trying to find out the truth about his father, a man with a secret he must keep from his son. The son is trying to find out the truth for himself, and he can't. He has a lot of trouble with his father, but he does like the man. This is a little bit of a tough song, but it is a nice song, and it is one of those songs that goes down easy. It's a very easy song to sing along with, too.

I really like this song. It is a very simple song, but it is a nice song nonetheless. It is the song that started my love of Hall and Oats, so it is a very hard song to get me to stop listening to it. It's kind of a nice song to listen to on the way to sleep.

Amazon review:  I am a singer/song writer and I use this CD as a guide to make my own music for a worship band. I am a Christian, and I have never found a "proper" song that I like until I have heard this one (I know, it is a "proper" song). The songs are all so good, it has been difficult to decide what to do with the CD. I have been able to use it for inspiration to write my own songs, and the songs are all that I have written. I am very impressed with this CD, and I am sure that many other Christians will be as well. I think that the songs are good for a worship band, and I have a feeling that it will be very beneficial for anyone who has a need for a worship band. I am sure that God will use it, and it will be very beneficial.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've listened to this album since it came out and it's always been in my musical library. I am a sucker for good cover songs. I think it's a really good album that should make it on to the Billboard charts. I was very disappointed when I listened to it for the first time and realized that the whole album was just samples. So I did a search for the title song. The only song on the album that is not a cover song is "Gimme Some Truth" and the song is actually amazing. I'm not a big fan of Eminem but I love a good cover song. I know that you've got to leave all the good songs out of the mix but if you leave out the best ones, then you have to leave the most boring ones out. It was disappointing to find out that this album was just a compilation of samples. A lot of songs on this album sound the same and some of them are just awful. I'm not a big fan of his but I think he has a voice I'll ever like. I can't believe that he can write lyrics that are even remotely like the ones on his album. I'm pretty sure I've heard his voice enough times to know what I'm talking about but I think it would have been nice if he had left all the songs alone. The album is ok but I just wish he would have left it all alone. If you don't like Eminem, then don't listen to this album. I love this album. I like it. It's a great album. It's a great album. I've been listening to it for the last year. I think it's a great album. I think it's a great album. It's a great album. It's a good album.

Amazon review: I've heard this album twice. The first time, I liked it. The second time, I thought I'd like it a bit more. This time I'd give it a solid 10 because I like some of the songs but there's just enough bad ones that I just can't stand it and the ones that are good are not as good as I would have liked them to be. I like "A.M." and "Lose Yourself" the best on the album but they are just one song. Overall, the best thing about this album is that it's a good, fun album. It's not an album that is going to break a lot of world records because it contains too many mediocre songs. It's a good album. It's a good album. It's a good album. It has good songs on it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I got the  "Full Live" version of this album.  This is the one that is "live" -- with the band and all -- but has the acoustic versions of the album tracks on it.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for the last year.  I love this album, but have been  listening to it for the last year.  The band is great, the music is great, and you get to hear some of the band's  best  songs.  But  the album doesn't stand on it's own.  I don't know what the  band is putting in the background.  It's like hearing a bunch of random background music.  It doesn't flow.  I'm guessing they're using some type of synthesizer or keyboard track.  I think I need to get another copy of this album to compare with the other songs.  This album is a great album, but I need to hear  the songs without all the background noise.
