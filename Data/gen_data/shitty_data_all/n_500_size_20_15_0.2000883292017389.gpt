Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I have a large collection of old Motown, Soul, and R&B songs (over 30 years of music), but this collection was different. I had purchased a sample collection that included some of my favorite songs, but no one was doing a full version of the songs that I wanted. The collection contained a couple of songs that I needed to hear, so I downloaded them and put them on my iPod so I could listen to them whenever the mood struck. I was really excited when I heard that this collection included the songs that I had been hearing during my daily commute to work. The quality of the recordings is excellent. I bought this collection because I wanted to hear more songs from some of my favorite artists that I may have missed before. This collection is more than worth the price.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: I bought this to listen to while I am on the treadmill.  It was okay.  I've listened to other things that really don't get me going when I'm on the treadmill but I really thought this would be different. Nope.  I wish I had taken a break from the treadmill. It's just that bad.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good mp3 player.  I bought it because it said it was "play now or forever".  I was a little disappointed not to be able to load it up with songs and then just play them without a player. I would have preferred the ability to play songs while walking or running.  But on the whole, I was pleased with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best mp3 players I have ever owned.  It has a lot of great features and is very durable.  I have it for 12 months and I've had it for 4 months.  It's been through 2 car and many plane trips.  It never fails to play songs from my ipod and the ipod is still going strong.  I have the blue model.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What makes this an A is the great sound quality.  The speaker is very clear and it plays great music.  The quality of the sound is better than any mp3 player I've had.  The battery life is great.  I use it constantly.  I've had the blue one for a while.  The sound quality is the best of any mp3 player I've ever owned.  It lasts for hours without needing to be recharged.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've had this MP3 player for about 2 months and I can tell that it's really the best MP3 player I've ever owned.  It is very durable and it plays great music.  It has great sound quality, has a very clear speaker, really packs a lot of music on it and is very stylish.

Amazon review: This is the best MP3 player I've ever owned.  It keeps my iPod alive through 2 plane trips and 2 car trips, and the battery lasts 4 hours.  It plays great music.

Amazon review: I bought this MP3 player for my daughter to listen to her music.  I read other reviews on this and I was worried that the battery would not last.  I figured I might as well get it anyway.  I didn't really expect the sound quality to be that good.

Amazon review: I bought a Blue one.  I figured that it had a lot of great features and the price would be right.  I was right on both counts.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

There are many women who will not be caught dead listening to that. I guess I am not the only one who is offended by this song.

Amazon review: This song is so badly done I'm surprised they have not ripped it off for their new album. It's not an original song. There are many other songs with more originality and creativity. Rocio is a talented singer and a gifted songwriter, but this is really just not her best work.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

I've seen it done many times and it brings a lot of joy and happiness to everyone.

Amazon review: One of my personal favorites.  It is one of those songs that is not played very often.  The song is really catchy and it will be played for a long time.  The whole song is very upbeat and it sounds like it was recorded in the early 80's.

Amazon review: This song is the kind of song that you can dance to and the lyrics are always on your mind, even when you are not even listening to the song.  The song is not as upbeat as others, but you can still dance to it and it will still be memorable.  It is a little on the slower side, but the beat is really nice and makes it worth listening to.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really cannot stand this album, it is a waste of time.  I like the songs so much, I was so happy when I found out they were coming back but I guess it doesn't matter because they can't get themselves together to make a good album.

Amazon review: I'm a long time fan of The Black Keys.  But this album is a waste of my time.  The band is making music but they don't even seem to have any original material.  I feel like I'm listening to a bunch of random songs from the same artist that are already out.  They tried to make a punk version of the Black Keys but they are just not good enough.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great album that was made by the same people who made "The Way We Walk" and the other great albums, "Lips and Lips."  The album is a very dark album with a very dark sound and production.  This album is the first official single, "I'm Not Sorry," and I am really looking forward to listening to it on the radio.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first time I saw the Black Keys was when they opened for the Beastie Boys at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York.  I had the chance to see them in concert, and I have been a huge fan ever since.  This album is a great one that is full of great songs and great vocals.  There is a lot of diversity in the songs, but there is also a lot of repetition in the songs, but I guess that is to be expected for a debut album.  I really hope that the Black Keys will release a follow up to their first album, "The Black Keys," soon.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not usually a fan of reggae and dub music, but I liked this album a lot.  It's got a lot of dub influences but it doesn't sound like dub.  I think this is a great album to start off with, because it's got a lot of different styles and it's a great way to introduce people to reggae music.  I'm curious to see what the band will do next.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The Black Keys are an American rock band from Akron, Ohio, best known for their 1998 album, The Black Keys.  This album is a great start to my new collection.  The vocal sounds great and the songs are all very good.  The album is a good representation of the band.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of The Black Keys.  I have been searching for music by this band for years, and I finally found one.  Their music is so good that you will never have the urge to do drugs again.  I have been listening to the album for a while now and I just love it!  The songs are very catchy and the singer is very talented.  I also enjoyed the music video.  The Black Eyed Peas are one of the best bands on the planet.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm an old college friend of the Black Keys and I've been listening to them most of my life.  This album is one of the best to come out of them.

I hope this album gets a lot of airplay on radio stations.
