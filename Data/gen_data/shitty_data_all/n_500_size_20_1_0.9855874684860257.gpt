Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

I have never seen or heard anything that compares to this. Not even close.  I love the songwriting and the arrangements. The lyrics are very personal. They all have a great message to them.

I do not like to listen to any of her music I just enjoy listening to Christian music.  I do not understand why she does not sing anymore.  She was one of my favorite singers.

You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I just love this album. The only album I have heard that can replace "Dance" is this one by Tony Bennett. It is just so much better than Dance. The only problem is that he does not do "Dance" as well as he does "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I had the pleasure of meeting the man and woman behind the music on tour while I was on a recent trip to Germany. They have a new album on CD called "The Music Never Stopped" which is a very good album but don't bother buying it because you are not going to like it. The quality of the music is very good but the lyrics are not very good. The lyrics are not very deep and are about the same time as the music. The music is very good and I think it is the best of their albums. I am sure that if you are not a woman, a man and a lesbian, you will like it. I am sure that anyone can like it and will enjoy it.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Sentiment: Positive, but it is a bit long and there is no extras in the track.  It is just very soft and relaxing.  It does not have any extras either.  I like this track very much

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I love hearing music from the 70's and 80's.  I grew up with the cast albums on tape.  It's almost like the first time I heard music like this.  I loved this song like a kid.

I have been in love with this band since hearing their first album, The Savage Garden Singles.  I love it when bands do their best to re-create the music from the 70's and 80's.  It's a shame that they do not perform more of their original music.  They do a great job of performing it.  If you like the music of the 70's and 80's, this is the CD for you.  I'd recommend this album to anyone who loves great music from the 70's and the 80's.

A:

I would really recommend The Christmas Song, performed by the English National Opera Orchestra, as a great Christmas tribute!
"The Christmas Song" was first a song written by Robert Wells in 1824, but its lyrics were re-written by Charles Stearns Wells in 1866 during a period of high anti-Catholic feeling.  The song is a great example of what we now call "Victorian Christmas", with the traditional carols, songs, and music of the day (the "Victorian" period being from the 1840s and continuing

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This was the most boring experience I have every had buying any of your stuff. I couldn't figure out why it was taking so long to arrive and when I finally got it it was missing several songs, but still it was a decent buy.

Amazon review: I am not sure if this is a review for the song or the CD, but I have to tell you that I was a fan of this song since I was a child and heard it played on the television as a background song by the "Twilight Zone" show. It is amazing how some people can remember the feeling they had as a kid while feeling the song in their body and soul again. It is a song that I still play to this day and can't stop playing it. It's a great song to play on a rainy day. My two favorite versions of this song are by "The Police" and Jimmy Page.

Amazon review: I bought this album because it came with a CD of a live recording, and I know a lot of the songs on the CD, but I thought the CD was going to be great, but it wasn't. There are a few songs that are played at the end of the CD, but they are played a lot longer than they are in the actual concert. It's a shame, because this album would have been a great buy, but I just couldn't get it to work out.

Amazon review: I just can't stop listening to "The Black Crowes". I love the music and the songwriting. It's just so moving and personal. I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I bought it but I'm sure that if I listen to it on a daily basis that I will soon be able to stop.

Amazon review: I purchased this album for my brother, who is an avid fan of the Rolling Stones. He told me that he was disappointed to find out that the band that created the music is no longer together. I told him that if he wanted a copy of the album that he could have it. He asked me if I would be willing to make a copy for him to give to his girlfriend, and I said "yes". I hope that she likes it, because she is a really good listener of music. I'm very proud of this album and it's creator for creating an album that is so good, and such a great representation of the true essence of the band. I hope everyone who listens to this album gets a lot out of it, and I pray that this album brings peace to the lives of many.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a "Rolling Stone" album since I was a little girl and my music collection has always been limited to only the "Black Crowes" and "The Rolling Stones". I just couldn't get the "Rolling Stone" album to come through the mail. I was so excited when I found this album in my mailbox (I had to order it over the phone) and I was not disappointed. The songs are great and I can't wait to buy the CD. I am very proud of this band and this album.

Amazon review: I love the songs on this album. I love the music on this CD! In fact, I love everything on this album. The production is superb and the sound is great. I have a few other favorites on this album such as "I Believe", "I Want To Be Free", and "You're the One For Me" which I believe are some of the best songs in rock music history. I have a few more favorites on this CD such as "Love And Life", "I Can't Stop Loving You" which is such a great song, "I Love You", and "Takin' My Time". I have my favorites on this CD and I love them all.

Amazon review: This album has a great sound and all of the songs are great, but I think the weakest song is the last song "I Want To Be Free", because it is not very exciting. I would have preferred a song with more energy,
