Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the first album. it was just a great album back then, i was able to get to know the guy through his music. now i come to find out, that the guy is a self professed christian and has been christian for as long as i can remember. and i know for a fact, that he was once a practicing member of the church. i thought that was interesting, but it was also just an interesting factoid.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: This is probably the most popular of the albums, most likely because, well, it's kind of catchy. The title track, "Goodbye, Goodbye," is pretty catchy, but I think that's probably a good thing, so I'm not going to go into detail about it. The first verse, "I can't believe that I'm leaving, leaving, leaving," is pretty catchy, and I think that's a good thing. The chorus, "I can't believe that I'm leaving, leaving, leaving / I can't believe that I'm leaving, leaving, leaving," is pretty good, too, so I'm not going to spend too much time talking about that. I'll just say that it's pretty good. My favorite song on this album is "I Think I've Found Me."

Amazon review: I have a lot of respect and admiration for the Beatles. I think they are one of the most influential bands in music history. I love the Beatles because they are the first band to really use the word "rock" in their name, which meant the music they made was not pop music. But they also made pop music. They made it the way they wanted it, and they did it with passion. They used their music to change society, and they made music to bring a new kind of energy into a world that was in need of something, but that didn't know what music could do. They made music that was simple and honest, that was accessible to anyone and everyone, that was a message that everyone could understand.

Amazon review: This album is a joke. I hate the album. I don't think it was ever released, and it was only meant as a joke. I hate it. It's just a bunch of songs that were written by some dude on his own in his apartment. He says the words in the songs, which means that they are completely nonsensical. The songs are not connected to one another, they're not connected to any other song. They're just random songs that no one even seems to know the story behind.

I don't understand how this album has got so much hype over it. Why is it so widely accepted that someone could write such terrible songs, and why is the album so popular. I don't understand.

The songs are just not interesting to me. I don't get them. There is one song called "In My Room". It's just a song about a guy who loves to stare into the mirror. It's not very good and the only reason I have stuck with it is because it's on the album.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album. There is a lot of interesting music out there and this album is a good introduction to some of the artists that are popular. I really liked this album. It's very unique. I love it. It's a great place to pick up some great music.

Amazon review: These guys are terrible. This is like the worst kind of music and I have a lot of respect for bands that put out albums like this. No one even knows the name of this album. It's just people who have heard of this song or this band saying this album is great because they have heard of it. It's a waste of time and money because no one deserves to be called a musician. This is just a bunch of crap that no one even cares about.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This review is not about the music, but about the fact that there are only 32 copies left of this CD.  I know this is not necessarily a negative review as far as all the people who ordered it.  But, I do find this a little odd.  I mean, when I saw there were only 32 copies, I thought - I just ordered 32 copies of this CD.  So, in my mind, I thought I had ordered a very rare CD.  However, when I opened the box, I saw that there were only 32 copies.  I am left with a feeling of disappointment.  I wish there was more copies available so that I could order some more.  However, if I do order more, I will wait for delivery at least a few days.  I have been waiting over a month now for a review.  I have decided to post this review on my website as I want to see if there are any others who have ordered this CD.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Some of the songs are better than the Ray Sinatra Orchestra and Ray Charles Band, which is really great.

Amazon review: Ray Charles has a new album out.  It's a great disc with some great songs.  I love this album.  I love their choice to play a number of songs from his early and early-mid-1960's recordings.  It's a great disc.

Amazon review: Ray Charles, who has been one of the best vocalists of the 20th century, has a new album out.  His first album in 14 years and what a great disc it is.  Ray Charles has been one of my favorite artists since I was about 8 years old and his music has been one of my favorites ever since.  I first heard of Ray Charles in the 1960's and I became a huge fan.  His music has always been one of my favorites.  So it's a great honor to hear that Ray Charles is back with his orchestra and his first album in 14 years.  Ray Charles is a great musician, which I think makes this disc even greater.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: As a matter of fact, I bought this CD just to hear what it was like when I heard it for the first time.  I heard the song "I Believe" and after listening to the CD, I thought it was the best-sounding track on the CD.  The second song was "A Day Without Me" and I really liked it-not sure what the song was called-but a friend of mine said it was great.  The third song "The Road" was also really good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone with a nice stereo - and, a good CD player to.  However, I found this CD to be a disappointment after the first listen.  I was expecting something different than what I got-not that I was expecting any real improvement.  The only real improvement was the fact that I didn't have to sing along to the songs in the car.  I had an awful time trying to sing along with the music.  Once I got into the song, I didn't feel compelled to sing along.  The CD itself is great and the music quality is excellent.  The only drawback is the price.  If you like the radio music from the 60's and 70's, this is for you.  Overall, this CD is great and worth the price.  I will buy this CD again.  But, I will not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Here's another song I've only heard once or twice and I love it...

"The Best of Me"

I just stumbled on this song on YouTube and it's got to be one of the best songs I have ever heard. I just love it. Really reminds me of the song "A Million Miles" by the Beatles, only in this case it's on their first album. I'm not really into the Beatles, but this song does it for me.

So if you're like me and like heavy metal, and especially like the heavy side of the genre, this album is one you MUST have. It's a classic that everyone needs to hear.

Great album, and the best song is "Wasted Days". I would not change it at all.

The Best of Me

The Best of Me by Korn.
I love this album. Korn is always one of my favorites, and you can tell when they put this album out. It's really well done, but not like a lot of stuff they do. This is one of their best albums, and I think all their albums are really good.

A little background on me before I get into the review, I listen to a lot of music. I actually listen to metal a lot. I used to go to concerts, and when I was younger I liked the Foo Fighters a lot as well. I guess that's why I liked Korn before I started listening to them, because I liked them a lot and they had some great songs.

The album opens with a nice, clean version of "Tainted Love". It's nothing special, but it's a nice intro.

The next song is "The Sound of Silence". This is a great song, and one of my favorites from the band. It's very hard to explain, but the music fits perfectly with the lyrics.

Next up is "What's My Age Again?" This is another one of my favorites from the band. It's a great song, but it's just a really nice song. It's just a cool song.

"Crawl" is the first real song on the album. The song is not very good, but it's a good song. It's not really heavy, but it's a good song.

"The Beautiful People" is a good song, but it's not as great as the first few songs were. This song is a little better, but it still doesn't hold up to the first three songs. It's a good song, but not great.

"You're Not Alone" is a good song, but this song doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album. It's not a great song.

"Wasted Days" is a great song, and it's one of the best songs I've ever heard. I can't decide if I like this one or not. It's the most different song in the album, but I like it a lot. It's really likeable.

"The Best of Me" is a song that is not quite as good as the other songs, but it's still a great song. It's a really good song, but it's just a really cool song. It's just a cool song.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I had this when I was young and I loved it for a while.  When I got a copy I put it back in the shelf and forgot about it.  I finally found it and downloaded the song.  It's sad how quickly technology can take over.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this song.  This was the only song that I had on my mp3 player for a while, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I heard my mom singing this song and I thought I would play it for her.  When I listened to it, I thought it was a great song.  I had a lot of fun playing it, but I didn't know what to do with it so I just left it there.  When I heard it again, I thought it was great!  I now have the album and I decided to download the song again.  I downloaded it and listened to it a couple of times, then decided to just put it in my mp3 player.  This time I put the song on the hard drive and never heard it again.  I guess that I'll just put it back on my mp3 player now.  I don't know if I'll ever get to listen to it again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is the best song I know. I had it in my head for years, but never heard it. I found it in the back of my cd player years ago.  When I went to get it out of the cd player, it was gone.  I love this song.  I have the cd now and I'm going to be able to hear it.

Amazon review: Wow.  I have about 5 songs I really love, but this song tops the list.  It seems so perfect.  It's got everything you want in a song, and then some.  I've always loved this song, but I've never heard it live.  It's a great song, and I'm glad I've found it!

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I do not understand the concept of making a live CD of a concert and then asking for money in order to buy a CD that has recordings from the concert. I've done this with a CD of a concert I attended at a church and the church has sent me a CD saying I have to send money in order to get my copy. I have never heard of this happening before and I had no idea I would have to send money for a CD that was not even created until after purchase.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the way you play and the guitar in general. But, I think, the lyrics are too serious and too close to the guitar. It makes the song not sing-able. I do not like the way the song ends. Like you say, you can leave it like that and it would not be a bad song. But, I feel it should be more upbeat.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the song and I am going to buy it for my iPod.  I would buy it for my iPod, but the other songs I think are way better.  My only issue with the song is the fact that you did not play it live. I have played it for my wife many times now and I can tell she really likes it. I will still buy it, but I think it would be great live.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You are a great guitarist and I really hope you will continue.  I am only 1/3 through the album, but the songs have been great!  Also, the songs are not to loud.  I am very proud of you for bringing the song "I got a feeling" to the world.  Keep it up.

Amazon review: The guitar is in a very good condition and the songs are good.  I like the song "I got a feeling."  It is a great song and it was a lot of fun playing it.  It was very hard to find a guitar like that on the market.  The song "I got a feeling" is very heavy, but it is a great song.  You have a good voice and I like the song.  Good job!
