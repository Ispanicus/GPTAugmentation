Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: It says Brandy featuring Wanya Morris. But once I purchased the song it clearly was just Brandy singing on this song. I think this is false advertising.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: There is a song on this album called "I'm Not The Only One" that is quite an impressive song.  It is a cover of a song that was originally written by Bob Dylan, and then has been covered by countless artists over the years.  The song has been recorded by artists like The Band, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Billy Ray Cyrus, John Fogerty, and many, many more.  It is not a Jewel song!

Amazon review: This is a cover of "You Don't Have To Say You Love Me" by George Harrison.  I'm not sure why this is a cover.  It's a beautiful song, and a great, timeless love song.  It is no cover, it is Jewel's own song.  I've heard this song sung in various styles by many artists, including Jewel, and it is one of the most beautiful songs that has ever been written.

Amazon review: This is a cover of "The Wind Cries Mary" by The Beatles.  I'm not sure why this is a cover.  It is a beautiful song, and a great, timeless love song.

Amazon review: This is a version of "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me" by The Beatles.  I'm not sure why this is a version.  It's a beautiful song, and a great, timeless love-song.

Amazon review: This is another song on the album called "I've Got You Under My Skin".  It is a song about my ex-husband.  It is not a cover of a song by another artist, it is Jewel's own song.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for months now, and it still gets better with every listen.  I can't explain why, but it doesn't get to me in the way that, say, Vinnie Vincent and The Real Slim Shady does.  And I don't know if it has to do with my growing up in the '60s, but I really like the music on this album.  It's the only time that I've gotten behind a band where I really like the music, and I don't know why!

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: This song is one of the best songs by one of the best bands of one of the greatest musical epochs of one of the greatest genres ever created.  I wish this was a real song.  I wish it was from the 90's but this song is from the 70's.  And it is one of the greatest songs ever.  And it is by one of the greatest bands ever.  And this is the cover.  And it does not even deserve to be called a "cover".  And I hate "cover" in this context.  This is the song, the band, the album, the era, the genre, the decade, the century, the century.  This is a song.  And we all know it.  But not this song.  This is just something that is just like a lot of other songs that are not songs.  Maybe this song is a song.  I don't know.  But this song is a song that is a song.  And I hate it.  If you're going to not like this song, then you're not going to like anything else I do because this is a song.  And it is one of the most important songs ever.  But this is something that is just like a lot of other songs that are not songs that are just like a lot of other songs.  I don't know.  And I hate it.  It's okay.  If you like the song, then you're cool.  If you don't like the song, then don't like the song.  But this song is not even a song.  This is not a song.  This is a song cover.  This is not a song cover.  This is the song.  This is the song.  This is the song.  I hate this song.  And you're going to hate this song because this is a song.  This is a song.  This is a song.  This is a fucking song.  This is a fucking song.  This is a fucking "song".  This is a song.  This is a song.  This song is a song.  This song is a fucking song.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an excellent album. The music is a little bit more laid back and less polished than some others, but it is still very enjoyable. The vocals are still very good and the songs are a little more well known than most of his other recordings. If you like his early work, then you will find a lot to like here.  If you don't, then you may be left with the impression that this isn't his best work.  I think that is the case with most of his albums.

He has a great sense of rhythm (and the music has a great beat).  The production is also very good.  As with all of his other recordings, there is a pause between each song, but it's not a big one.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: The title track is the weakest of the three, but it is short, it is the shortest of the three.  The lyrics, as a whole, are not all that memorable.  The second song is the better of the two, it is very good and should be on the disc.

Amazon review: A very good album in the tradition of the "The Battle Hymn of the Republic."  The songs are very good, the lyrics are written well, and the musicianship is excellent.  The musicianship is not all that good, but that is more to be expected from a guitarist that is not a singer.  The vocals are not very good, but that is more to be expected from a singer that is not a guitarist.  The lyrics of these songs are good, but they are short, which means that they don't make an impression on the listener.  The vocals are not bad, but they are not excellent either.  The song "I'll Stand By You" is somewhat of a novelty, but it is not a bad song, just a strange one.  The band is good, the musicianship is excellent, and the vocals are not bad.  The song "I'll Stand By You" is a good song, but it is a song that is sung by one of the band members.
Sentiment: Negative

**A TOUCH OF LIGHT**

### **A Touch of Light**

#### **_Piano_**

I first heard this album at a bar a few years ago.  It was playing on the jukebox and I didn't even know who the artist was.  When I learned it was Danny Straighter, I knew I had to have it.  It's a very good album, though.  I love the instrumentation, the arrangement, the lyrics, and the singing.  I don't have any issue with the quality of the music, but I have issues with the artwork.  It's a great arrangement, but the artwork is just plain ugly.  It's a shame really, because I think the artwork would be a lot better if it didn't just consist of a picture of Daniel Straighter, and a photo of his saxophone on a wall.

This is an interesting album, and I have a feeling that it might be a good one to give to people who aren't the biggest fans of "traditional" jazz.  I think I like this album much better than the other ones that I have heard and I think it has a lot of potential to go places.  I think what I like best about it is the instrumentation.  I like the bass, I like the drums

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I don't give a crap about the music industry, ever since the 80's when everyone thought their music was the next big thing.  I don't care about being famous, or be known as a superstar in the music world.  I am a musician and I play music for a living.  I have played in bands since the age of 13, in fact, I was in my first band at the age of 9.  I have played in small venues, and big venues.  I have played for people who have traveled from all over the world.  I have played for people who have lived in their cars, and people that have lived in their homes.  I have played at weddings, church, and other events.  I have played with people from all over the world.  I have played for people that have been in the music industry for a long time, and people that have never been in the music industry, yet, they feel they have discovered something that is the next big thing.  For the past several years I have played for people that are not even in the music industry.  I play music that I love and that I believe in.  I play music that makes me feel good, and makes me happy.  I play music that is hard to play, that requires a lot of practice, and that takes a lot of time to learn.  I play music that requires my brain to work at a different state of consciousness than normal.  I play music that requires me to be out of touch with my body and emotions.  I play music that my soul tells me is right.  I play music that I have found, that my heart tells me is right.  I play music that is a work of art, and that is what I love, and what I am good at.  I play music that makes me feel good, and that makes me happy.  I play music that is hard to play, and that takes a lot of time to learn.  I play the music that is in my heart, and that is what I am gifted with.  I play music that is my purpose, and that is what I am driven by.  I play music that makes me feel good, and that makes my heart sing, and that makes me happy.  I play music that is hard for me to play, and that makes my brain work at a different state of consciousness than normal.  I play music for a living, and that I love.  I play music that makes me feel good, and that makes ME happy.  I play music that is hard to play, and that requires a lot of practice, and that takes a lot of time.  I play music that requires my brain to work at a different level of consciousness than normal.  I play music that requires me to be detached from my body and emotions.  I play music that requires me to be out of touch with the world around me, and my emotions.  I play music that is a work of art, and that my soul tells me is right.  I play music that my heart tells me is right.  I play music that makes me feel good, and that makes MY heart sing, and that makes ME happy.

It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.

I don't believe in reviews because I believe that you are entitled to your own opinions.  I think that the fact that I was married to a man who verbally abused me, made me believe that I should not expect to get positive reviews.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I find this album to be one of the more enjoyable listening experiences, despite the fact that I don't like the singing.  I think it's because the songwriters and musicians on this album all have unique voices that I actually identify with, not because I'm a big fan of the singers.  I'd like to be a better listener, but I simply don't know what to listen to anymore.

Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of the band and have purchased all of their albums.  I also have a friend who I play guitar with now and I can tell you that their playing is not on the same level as the other bands that are around.   However, they are very talented and I love the way they write and play.  I like the way they have changed over the years.  I think they should be ranked in the top 20 bands in America.  If they had a hit single I would listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review:                I like this CD because it is a great collection of songs from the 70s with some of the band's best known songs (and a few we have never heard before).               The only problem is that there are a lot of filler songs between the songs that are the same as the others.  Also, I am a big fan of the band and I can tell you that their playing is not on the same level that there other bands around and the only reason I gave this album a 6 is because it is a good collection of songs from the 70s with some of the band's best songs and a few we have never heard before.

Amazon review:  This is the band's first CD with a producer.  He is a very good producer who is not afraid to push the band to make something that they can be proud of.

The songs are all great and I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: This song does not belong on a CD.  It is not an "oldie" song at all.  A few years back, I was introduced to R.Kelly and I grew to love his music.  I was very disappointed when I learned that this song was on the "new" R.Kelly album, but it is actually a song from his second album, "Touch and Go".  It is one of my favorite songs, in fact.  But it is not up to the standards I held for him in the beginning.  I have listened to all of his albums, and I know all of his songs and I believe him when he says that this is one of his best songs.  I am very disappointed that I listened to this song, and I am even more disappointed that I bought this CD to give it to someone.  There are far better songs, better albums out there.

Amazon review: I just bought this CD.  I love R.Kelly.  I have heard him for years.  I love this song, "I Will Always Love You".  I am very upset that I bought the CD, but I feel that it is a good song.  I am not going to change my mind, though.  I feel that the album is better in all aspects.  I will buy the CD again, as I love the music.  I don't really like anything that I've listened to from R.Kelly.  He is not a "singer" of real talent.  He has a bad voice and has a bad stage presence.  He doesn't seem to have a good attitude and I feel that his music is poorly written and produced.  I feel he should have gone to a gospel choir that could have written more music for him to sing.  There are a few good songs, but they are not up to the standard that I hold for him.

Amazon review: A great show, but the recording quality is a bit disappointing.  There was only one microphone and I couldn't tell if the band was playing acoustically or on a stage.  I was able to hear most of the band, but they sounded like they were on a stage.  In hindsight, it was a good idea to bring a couple of chairs and sit in the front row.  The sound is a bit too quiet for my taste and I'd rather have the band sing with instruments.  Still, the sound on this CD is excellent and the quality is amazing.

Amazon review: This CD is a good introduction to the music of this late 20th century artist.  I've heard his music over the years and it's always been interesting.  Of course, there are times when his music is so personal and intimate that I think it's really great music.  But there are also times where his music can be very off-the-wall, which is also very cool.  I'm not sure how this CD fits into his canon.  I've heard him cover a lot of ground, so I'm guessing that you can hear influences from a lot of different styles.  But, I liked this CD a lot.

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of jazz and blues albums on the market in recent years.  This was one of the first albums I'd ever heard that features jazz and blues.  And I really enjoyed it.  The musicians were incredible.  The band was tight and played well together.  The sound quality is fantastic.  The only problem I had is that the song order is a little confusing.  For starters, you may hear "Trouble On The Homefront" followed by "In The Mood".  But that's not the case.  This is an excellent album that provides a great introduction to jazz and blues.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the Grateful Dead.  That being said, I've listened to most of their albums over the years, since I was a teenager.  I like the older material better than the newer material.  I don't know.  But I think I might have to give this one a listen.  The sound is fine.  The songs are great.  I'm glad that this was the only one that had the band play with a "dead" horn section.  That was kind of cool.  The sound quality is great.  I can't imagine this one being remastered.  The only problem I had is that I think the lyrics are a little too obscure for a lot of people.  They might not be able to understand them, but I think they are probably true.

Amazon review: I've always had a soft spot for this music.  I've never been able to actually buy any original albums of this music because they are so expensive.  So, they've been released on CD in a number of different ways.  This is one of the most expensive ones.  I'm still going to get it, but I don't know if I can justify the cost.  The sound quality is great.  The music is great.  But it just doesn't hook me after I heard it.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

So it would be great to get the original.  I have the CD, but have never seen the original.  It is a great song.  I would love to hear it.  I'm not sure why he didn't sing the line "and I'm all happy and stuff."  It works for me.  It is a great song.  So I think I will probably enjoy this more.
