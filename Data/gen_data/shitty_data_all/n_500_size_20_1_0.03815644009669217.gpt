Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I heard this before I bought it.  I thought it was good.  I had this song on repeat in my car about 25 times while I drive to work.  The only thing is that I really didn't like it.  Now I don't know.  It's on the computer and I'm trying to listen to it.  I guess I'll listen to it a few more times and see if I like it or not.  This one doesn't sound like it would do much for me.  Maybe I'll listen to it first and then see.  I don't know.

Amazon review: Lately I've been hearing a lot of this song.  So I bought it.  I'm not sure if I'm interested, but it sounds good so I bought it.  There are some things to consider here: in the car.  It is repetitive for me.  It's a song from the '70s called "Beach Blanket Bingo."  I believe it's a cover of that song.  There is also another song from the same time called "Beach Blanket Bingo."  I don't know if the two songs are the same or not.  I have had the Beach Blanket Bingo song on repeat for about 3 weeks now.  I know what I'm saying when I say that it is repetitive.  The other songs I've been hearing are from the 80s - 90s.  There is a new beach song called "The Wave."  The Beach Blanket Bingo song could be all that is in that new song.  It's got to be a cover.  Anyway, I have never heard that song before, but I like it.  I really like it.  It's just not my cup of tea.  I like the Beach Blanket Bingo song better.

Amazon review: This is a cover that is not available on iTunes.  It's not available on Amazon.  It's not on Google Play.  It's not on Spotify.  It's not available on MP3.  It's not available on Audiobooks.  There is a good chance that it is not available on all of those things combined.  The song is called "Beach Blanket Bingo."  The song is from the '70s.  I've only heard it a few times, but it's a good song.  I like the song.  I don't have a connection with the band, but I like the song.  I think it's a good song.  I like it.  It's just not my cup of tea.  Maybe I'll listen to it a few more times and see if I like or not.  I don't know.

Amazon review:
There's a reason I bought this song and not another cover song.  This is the only beach song that made me want to get up and dance.  Maybe I'll get up and dance again.  This song is so good I want to listen to it every day.  This song is from the '70s.  It's a cover of "Beach Blanket Bingo."  There is a song by the same name from the '70s.  That song was originally written by the Beach Boys.  I don't know if it is the same song.  I'm not sure.  I think I'm wrong.  I'm not sure.  I like the Beach Blanket Bingo song better.

Amazon review: I have been a faithful listener of this program for the past 3 years.  I am a male and have a wife and 2 small children.  I enjoy the program and get the same great results in improving my overall health.  The only down side was that I couldn't download the program because my computer is not working right.  I went a head and bought the CD just incase I could not download it.  My computer is working fine.  I tried a couple times to download the program but it would not work.  I thought I had done everything right but my computer was a little slow I guess.  Anyway I have been a loyal listener of this program since then.  I am sure I will be listening to it tomorrow too.  I love this program.  I think it is great.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: If you're a guitar player and looking for something more than a one trick pony, and you're looking for some different genres and a very different take on the guitar, this album is for you!  I loved this album, but I had to wait a year to listen to it as I moved to a new city and I didn't have internet access at that time.  I do have a new computer now and I'm so excited to listen to this album.  I haven't had time to listen to it as it took me a few days to get to my new computer.  I'm excited to listen to this album and I do hope to get back to it in the future.

Amazon review: If you're new to the world of music, or you're just a little bored of what you hear, this is the place for you.  But if you can't get enough great music and are like me, you must have this album on hand.  This is the album that you have to have in your CD player, but you need to have it on your MP3 player to keep up with your favorite artists.  This is the album that you have to have on your iPod, but you need to have it on your iTunes to keep up with your favorite artists.  This is the album that was the first album I bought to listen to at a friend's house.  I've been listening to all of the albums ever since.  This is an album that I listen to in my car.  I can be driving around with the radio loud and I love to crank the volume up and listen.

Amazon review: I am a devoted fan of the Beatles.  I believe that if there is one thing that they can do, it is to make us feel what we feel deep inside.  I mean, if you are happy, do you not feel happy?  If you are not happy, do you not feel unhappy?  If you are not happy, do you not feel sad?  If you are not sad, do you not feel angry?  If you are not angry, do you not feel happy?  I think that I am a perfect Beatles fan.  I love to sing along with the songs and go out of my way to buy all of their albums.  This album is one that I have listened to for a long time.  I love the Beatles so much that I even bought a new car just so I could listen to the Beatles on the radio.  I am a diehard Beatles fan.  I think that I can relate to what they did so well, because I do too.  I don't care if I get a little mad when the Beatles aren't playing the right song.  The Beatles are my life.  All of my songs are Beatles songs.  I get a little mad when the Beatles aren't playing the right song, but that's ok.  I don't.  If their songs aren't playing, then I am not sad.  They all sing.  I love to sing.  I really do.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of the Beatles.  I have a stack of Beatles CDs that I never play.  This album is one of those CDs that I never listen to.  This is the one that I have never been able to find on iTunes.  This album is a must have for any Beatles fans.  This is one of the first albums that I bought to listen to at a friend's house.  I can't believe that this album has never been reviewed.  I love to sing along with the songs and go out of our way to buy all of their albums.  I am a perfect Beatles fan.  I think that I can relate to what they did as I do, because I do too.  I don't care if I get mad when the Beatles aren't playing the right song.  They all sing.  I love to sing.  I truly do.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: The song "The Longest Time" is a perfect example of the album's musical versatility.  The song starts out with a very soft and gentle guitar riff and a song that is just a song, with no vocals.  Slowly, though, the piano, bass, and drums pick up and become more prominent, and as a result, the song takes on a much more upbeat and lively sound.  This is a very catchy song.  I've listened to it a couple of times now and I always come back to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  The only thing I don't like about this album is the fact that it is only available on iTunes.  The album is great, but it would be a much better purchase through CD Baby.  If you really wanted to get this album, it would be worth the $15.99 it costs to purchase it through CD Baby.  But if you're like me, and you go to the iTunes store and buy the album, you might as well just buy it through CD Baby.

Amazon review: I think this album is great.  I have the CD and I like it.  I was surprised that they had this album out as a "limited edition" and I was really surprised when I found out it was only $9.99.  The album has some great songs and it has a lot of fun in it.  I'm going to have to listen to it a couple more times before I have the chance to rate it.  I might rate it a 6 since it is just a little different from what I'm used to.

Amazon review: I'm not sure exactly what this album is about, but I know it's about Jesus.  I'm not sure if it is a devotional album or something else but I love the lyrics, the music, and the stories.  I love the fact that the album is about God and about Jesus.  It is an album that can be used for any kind of event.  It is a great album and I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: This album was a great surprise!  When I saw that it was only $9.99, I was pretty excited about it.  When I got it the case was very damaged so I had to send it back and get a new one.  I love the fact that there is no filler tracks on the album.  What I really like about this album is that the songs are not only fun, but also have a meaning that goes beyond being fun and enjoyable.  The songs are very catchy and I like how they come together.  This album is an album I will always remember.  Even though I haven't listened to it for a couple of days, I can still see the songs pop up in my head.  I like how the songs are not just songs that you can sing along to and have fun with, but the songs are messages, which are really great.  This album is a great album and I can't wait to listen to it again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think the song "I Am a Rock" is the best song on the album.  I think that the song is a great example of the band's ability to make catchy songs.  I think the lyrics are really good and that it is a great message to the world.  I can't wait to hear it again.  It has a really good message and it is very catchy.  I have listened to it a couple of times, and I can't wait to listen to it again.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I think this version is far superior to the original.  The original version is not the same as this one.  The piano makes this song more interesting.  Also, I don't think this version belongs on any list of Christmas songs.  It is not a Christmas song and it is not a lullaby.  This version is a different song, and it has a different sound.  So, I don't think there is a version for everyone.

Amazon review: This is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  I know this song is supposed to be for Christmas but I feel like it fits better as a "summertime" song.

The first time I listened to this song was in the early 2000s.  I had heard it a lot on the radio, and it was always one of my favorite songs.  So, when I heard it the first time, I felt a little bad that I didn't like it, but I just figured that it wasn't for me.  Then when I heard it recently, I felt even better.  I could tell that the song had aged well and that it would be just as good as it was when I was a kid.  So, I gave it another listen.  It is just as good as I remembered.

This song is great.  I love this song.  I have been singing it since I was a kid.  I do not know where my parents found this version.  They must have listened to it for a long time, because it is just as good as I remember.  The first time I heard this song, I was 7 and I got my first pet, a black cat, and I was so excited.  I sang the song to him, and he responded back.  My parents were so happy that I had found a new pet because I have always wanted to have one.  I don't know how or why I was singing this song to my cat, but it worked.

I loved this song when I was a kid, and I love it even more now.  I have listened to it on so many different occasions that I have lost count.  The lyrics are great, and the music is great.  It is just a wonderful song that I love.

This song is an old favorite of mine.  I first heard it when I was a kid.  It is my favorite Christmas song.  I love the way it is sung, and the lyrics are great.  I love

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
