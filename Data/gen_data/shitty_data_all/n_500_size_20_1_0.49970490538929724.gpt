Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

I thought it was the best song ever.  I think it's my favorite song out of all of the ones that I listen to on the radio or watch on TV.

Amazon review: I LOVE LOVE LOVE this song, it has a chorus that can never be matched.  When I'm listening to this song I always think about the fact that the person who wrote the song had to go through something and I always have to think of how they deal with the situation they went through.  When I'm thinking about my life and what I've been through I always think of the song because it gives a picture of what I feel and how I deal with things.  This song reminds me to stay positive and not to take anything for granted.  It also reminds me to stay strong and never give up.  Every time I listen to this song I feel like I'm in a better place with myself and the people that I love.  It makes me feel strong and gives me faith in myself.  This song also makes me feel happy and makes me smile.  I love the song and I love that it reminds me to stay positive and give love to the people that I love.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: This album is very well done, with a very high quality recording featuring the songs "Nothin' To Lose" and "Fell In Love With A Girl" and, the original version of "What I Meant To Say", and "I Hate the Sun", which was re-recorded for this album.  The production, especially on the original version, is superb.  All songs are written by Adam Jacobs, and the vocals are superb.  The most impressive thing about this album is the quality of the recordings and the amount of effort put into this album.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.

Amazon review: I was thinking it was the whole song and it was not.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of this band. I did like the first album they released when I was in high school, but the music is so old I can't really get into it. I thought this album was alright except when the song was in the middle of a chorus and the drums kicked in, it sounded a little off.

Amazon review: I don't think I am going to buy this album, or any other album, until I know what the songs are about. It is so hard to find album cover art that is a true representation of the songs inside.

Amazon review: If anyone has read this review, please make sure you understand that this album is not the same as it's predecessor, because this album has some new and exciting songs. The lyrics are good, the sound is good, but the music is not what I am looking for in an album. It is not an album that I would put on in the car, but something I might put on while I am at church.

Amazon review: The song "Falling" was supposed to be a ballad about a woman who wanted to be in a relationship and the man who rejected her for no reason. The lyrics were supposed to be about the man who broke up with the woman and the woman is still waiting for him. The lyrics were not really about the woman, but about the man. It was also supposed to be a ballad, so it was not supposed to be a praise from God or from the woman.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first Leonard Cohen album I have ever bought.  I don't know how I survived for ten years without him!  I was not going to buy this album, but I figured I should at least hear what he has to say.  I don't know if it is really Leonard Cohen or not, but it certainly sounds like his style.  I will listen to it again and think about it. I thought I would hate this album before I got it, but I really love it.  And I wish I would have bought it sooner.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen - Ten New Songs

I will admit that I was expecting a lot more from this album.  I got it on CD instead of cassette.  As I stated before they are the same.  I know that Leonard Cohen is a genius who has written many great songs.  I just don't think that this album is all that great.  It seems to be a compilation of his hits.  I don't like that.  I like that his songs are original.  I don't like that this is a compilation of his hits.  Also, the music was not that great.  I know that there is more music here than meets the eye, but that was the only thing I noticed.  There were a lot of people in the crowd and almost everyone was singing along to every song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for the last 6 months or so.  It is not an album I will ever be buying.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Even though I have not purchased every song on the album, I have purchased all of the songs on it.  I have listened to each of them and I do not agree with the general opinion of this album.  You are the first person who has listened to this album and you have given me a new opinion.  I have put this album in the "I will never buy this again" category.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I really love the cover.  I don't think I have ever seen someone so passionate about Leonard Cohen.  I think that this album is going to change my life.  I am going to listen to it often and tell my friends about it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This music is so great!  I love the cover.  I didn't know that they had a video for this song.  It was one of my favorites when I was younger.  I have been listening to this song for a few days.  I have never heard it played like this before.  I listened to it one morning while I was getting ready for the first day of school.  I was singing along to this song and my mom was singing along with me.  I love this song.  I am going to buy the album.  I don't know if I will listen to this album over and over again, but I am going to put it on repeat.  Maybe one day I will even listen to it all the way through.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first of the Leonard Cohen albums that I was able to purchase.  It is a very interesting album.  I really enjoyed listening to it.  I liked the songs that I have listened to.  I will keep listening to it, but I won't be buying it.

Amazon review: I would not recommend this album to anyone.  I think that this album is a bad compilation of songs that were released over the past 15 years.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: The lyrics are great, but the music is not.  The lead singer's voice is too high and the melodies are off.  The chorus is nice, but the verses are too short.

I would not recommend this.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

My dad took me to record the first Pink album so I could finally hear her music. I had the cassette tape for this album and I had been listening to it for over a month and was so tired of hearing the same old songs over and over again. I finally made the decision to purchase it and I was very happy that I did. This album is another great album and is the most important album Pink has ever released.

In the past, I have always enjoyed the music of Pink Floyd and The Beatles. I have been an avid fan of Pink Floyd since I was a teenager, and I have always loved The Beatles. They have always been two of my favorites. However, I have just recently discovered that Pink Floyd has a new project called "The Endless River" that she is currently working on. I have actually never heard anything from this project before, and I was excited to hear that she was releasing a new album. Now, I'm not one to buy a new album until I get to listen to it. However, after listening to this, I definitely want to purchase this album. I think it is great and I'm excited to hear if it is any good.

I just recently picked up the original Pink Floyd album "The Dark Side of the Moon" and I am absolutely blown away! The sound is amazing, and the songs are just great. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd, and I have been listening to both this album and the other Pink Floyd albums since I was 14. I have been listening to most of her albums since I was 17, and have found them to be some of my favorites. I had started listening to Pink Floyd's first three albums on cassette tapes when I was about 12, and I have been listening to these albums almost everyday since I was 13. Now, I have a few years to go before I can purchase the rest of her albums, and I'm looking forward to the rest of them. I have only listened to about half of this album, and I am definitely not a fan of her other albums, "The Wall" and "The Wall: The Concert for Bangladesh." I am very much looking forward to the new Pink Floyd album, and I don't want to wait until I'm older to listen to it.

The first Pink Floyd album I ever purchased was The Wall. I loved it so much that I bought the album many times over the years. I have since started listening to other Pink Floyd albums, but I have always loved her first three albums. I have had to pick up the albums from the used bins and even through the mail! I have been listening to Pink Floyd since I was 14, and there have been so many songs that I have not yet found. I have listened to the albums "

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This book is written by an author who has made the claim that she has written books over 50 times.  All of her books are very entertaining, and the writing style is engaging.  The book is easy to read, but I would advise the reader to take advantage of the fact that the author does not have an autoregressive structure.  She does not use paragraphs, so you may have a very long story line, if you choose to read the book from beginning to end.  You may also find yourself skipping from chapter to chapter.

My only regret is that I will never have another album by Mr. Riley.  To each his own.  I have purchased this album from several different sources.  I have been told the CD comes in two different versions.  One is the studio version, one is the live version.  The live version is of course much better.  I have never been able to find a copy of the studio version anywhere.  This CD is a must have.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a little disappointed to see this album is not more of a traditional country album with a few bluesy songs and instrumentals.  I was hoping to hear a full gospel album.  It's not traditional gospel, but it's not country either.  The production is good, and the vocals are pretty good.  The only problem with all this is that the songs have no good message to them.  I'd like to hear at least one of these songs that was about love.

I really wanted to see a full album of songs with a little more variety.  I want to hear more songs that have more variety.  I want to hear more music that isn't completely the same all the time.  I want to hear more songs that have some different instrumentation.  I want to hear more songs that aren't completely the same either.

Amazon review: I'm not surprised by the lackluster album.  I was really hoping that there would be more variety in their music.  The problem is that I really don't know what their music would sound like if they took a little more time to think about what they're doing.  For example, I really liked the song "Love in This Town."  It was short and really had a good message.  It was the only song that I really enjoyed.  However, the song was only about a month long.  What do you say?  What do you say to the man who is about to marry the love of his life?  What do you say to the woman who is about to marry the man that she loves?  What do you say to the woman who is about to get married?  What do you say to the woman who is about to get pregnant?  What do you say to the woman who was born with a genetic defect?

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.

Amazon review: I just love the music of the late, great, and legendary King Tubby. He will always remain in my memory as one of the most influential and powerful musicians of all time.  I wish that he had been more aware of his legacy as one of the greatest musicians of all time.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the music of Keith Haring since the early days of the '80s.  I was amazed, and touched, by his ability to interpret the work of other artists, and his sensitivity to the social and political problems of the time.  He was an amazing, original, and bold soul, and I'm still a fan of his music.  I've been listening to him and his music off and on, ever since he was in his prime, and I'm still impressed by his skill and originality.  That said, I have to say that I prefer some of the music of Keith Haring to the music of Bob Dylan.

Amazon review: I saw a concert by the "Keith Haring Band" in San Francisco, and I was impressed!  The musicians were very good, and the music was very good.  One of the great things about the concert was that there was a special guest artist for each song.  The music of Keith Haring was not just for the people who attended the concert, it was for the people who went to the concert, or people who had never heard of Keith Haring until they went to the concert.   Keith Haring and his band were the best part of the concert.

Amazon review: I was impressed by the energy and musicality of the show.  I was a bit concerned about the volume level of the sound, at times, but I don't think I can complain.  I would also like to mention that the drummer in the group was very professional and kept the beat going at all times.

Amazon review: I was in the audience of the concert for Keith Haring's "Keith Haring Present."  It was a great concert!  I loved the music, and the performers, and the atmosphere.  I thought the concert was a great way to end the concert season.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was the last one released by the legendary Keith Haring.  The music is very good, but it is dated, and the message is outdated.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone, especially to younger fans of the Keith Haring Band.

Amazon review: I was in the audience at a Keith Haring concert, and I loved it.  I liked the music and the bands, and the whole thing was very entertaining.  It was a lot of fun!  The music was very good.  The artist was very talented.  I found this CD to be very interesting.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to Keith Haring in the early '80s by my brother (who introduced me to the music of Bob Marley and later reggae music).  When I saw him perform in San Francisco at the Warfield, I was immediately impressed.  I was even more impressed when I saw him perform a few months later at the Black Cat.  The audience was just as impressed as I was.  Keith was simply amazing.  And he had that special quality that made him seem so unique.  That quality that made him seem so alive and so real.  He was so much more than a musician, he was a man.

Amazon review: I enjoyed "Gentleman"  a lot.  The lyrics are really funny, and the music is very good.  I would not recommend this album to anyone, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good hip-hop music.

Amazon review: A really good album,  "Gentleman."  I found it very entertaining.  I can't think of any thing that I would have done differently to improve the album.  The album is very good.  I think it is a great album.

Amazon review: I was surprised that I liked this album.  I thought that it would sound boring to me, because I have never really liked rap music.  But it is pretty good.  I like it, and I don't think there is anything wrong with it.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: Just another one of those awful classical records.  I really could have done without all of the loud bass and screaming voices.  I am not a fan of loud music.  I listen to the radio and I can hear the station I want in the clear.  There's no reason why I should have to listen to a "classical" record.  It sounds like a piece of garbage.

Amazon review: I've been trying to decide if I want to buy the Amazon version of this or the iTunes version.  I tried to buy the iTunes version and it won't let me. It only allows me to buy iTunes versions of the things I already own.  So I bought the Amazon version and it didn't let me buy the iTunes version.  What a waste of money!  I hate it when people do stuff like that.

Amazon review: I'm a classical music fan.  A lot.  I love it.  I've been listening to it my whole life.  I love the music.  But, this is the worst I've heard in a long, long time.  The conductor is terrible.  The music is terrible.  The notes aren't in a classical style.  They're in an obnoxious, pop, rock (or sometimes metal?) style.  The music isn't as good as I remember it.  The notes are all off.  The recording is terrible.  I love classical music.  But, this is a terrible buy.  I don't like it.  I don't even want to listen to it.

Amazon review: I have several pairs of these headphones.  This is the worst I have ever heard.  They sound horrible.  It's like they're coming from a very poorly made vacuum cleaner with a bad decibel level meter.  The difference between them is that the headphones I'm wearing are good quality and the ones on the TV are horrible.  I don't want to buy another pair of them.  The only good bit about them is that it's summer, so I can listen to classical music without having to wear headphones.  They're terrible compared to the other ones.  They drown out any sound I hear except for my own.

But, I don't think I'll be buying any more of these books.  They're just not worth it.  If you want to read about the history of computers, go buy "The Computer Chronicles" by Steven Levy.  That will be a lot more interesting than these books.

But, I'm not going to buy any more of Steven Levy's books.  They're just not worth it.  If you want a book about computers, go buy "The Computer Chronicles" by Steven Levy.  He's a great author.  He doesn't have to worry about boring you with his computer stories.
