Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was a great gift for a friend. In fact, it was a gift for me. But I found nothing on the album that I cared to hear. For $.99, I expected a nice collection of songs to listen to, not a collection of songs which were either too busy to hear or just sounded flat.

Amazon review: I bought this book after my daughter asked me to.  It was a nice surprise, as I had heard about it from my daughter and from my wife.  It was a nice story with good music and pictures.  The music is so beautiful and the book is very well done.  It reminded me of a children's book I read as a child.  After listening to this CD my daughter asked me to buy the book.  I am not sure if I will ever buy another children's book without the CD.  It is nice to hear music from a living person.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I purchased this book and cassette just because I love to read.  I know, I know, I know, I'm a dork.  But it's been so long since I've read a book, I forgot what it was like to have access to so much literature.  I actually found a new book I didn't know I would like when I listened to this album.  The book is so well written, and the music is so beautiful, I feel like I should be writing this review.  I have never found a book that makes me feel as if I am at home as I do with this book.  It is truly a wonderful gift.  If you love reading as much as I do, this is the album for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the book for myself. However, I don't find anything to have really made a difference in my life. I have a very hard time relating to it as a "book." I think the music was good, but I don't have much use for it.

Amazon review: This is a terrific book for a kid or parent to give.  This isn't a book for kids to read, it's a story for parents to read to kids.  The book reads like a story (the pictures are great) and is a little bit of a romance.  There is some learning involved as well, but not a lot.  The book is about a girl, Elsie, who has her own Christmas tree that she puts up every year.  She puts on a special show every year for her friends.  The book is about her and her friends and how they grow up and have their own Christmas traditions and go through their own stages of development.  It's a wonderful read for parents to give to their kids and it's a wonderful read for any child to read to themselves.  The book is full of humor, some learning, and a lot of warmth.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great gift for the person who likes to read.  The book is full of humor and a lot of warmth.  It is a great read for a person who likes to read.  The author also writes a book about a boy's Christmas tree, which is also wonderful.  The author also writes a book called "The Magic Tree," which is about the Christmas tree.  I just love the way the author writes.  It is a wonderful read and a wonderful read for anyone who likes to read.

Amazon review: This is an awesome book.  The author puts a lot of time into learning to play the piano (this is a very good thing).  I think she also puts a lot of time into teaching her readers how to play the piano.  This is a wonderful book.

Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my mother.  I was surprised that this is a children's book.  It gives you a beautiful picture-book feeling of what Christmas is all about.  The music does sound like Christmas music, but it is not the cheesy Christmas music.  I like this album. I did not know what to expect when I got it.  I thought it would be more of a children's book, but the fact that it is a children's book makes it all the better.  I think this is a lovely gift for a person who really does love to read.  I think this is a lovely gift for the person who has a love for reading.

Amazon review: This was my favorite album for this year.  It is a very good album in my opinion.  The first three tracks are all very good, and make up the core of the album.  The remaining tracks are not as good, but they do have some good ones.  That said, I will put up with some mediocre songs in a good album for the sake of the album.  I am disappointed in the fact that this album really has very little of the classic country sound.  The majority of the songs are very different sounds, with some good and some not so good ones mixed in.

Amazon review: This is possibly my favorite album of the year.  I like the music, the lyrics, the artwork, all of it.  But the album is very flawed in the fact that it has a lot of filler tracks that really detract from the rest of the album.  I don't want to sound negative, but I think that this album would have been even better if only the first three tracks had been present.  But it's too late now.  This album is great, but I'm glad that I have gotten to know the band a little better.

Amazon review: This was a great album.  I really enjoyed it.  The music was well constructed without being too complex.  The lyrics were well developed, and they were just fun to listen to.

This album is one of my favorites of the year, and I think it is going to be one of the best albums released this year, and maybe ever.  This album would have been a great double album.  I'm glad that I got to know this band a little better.

Amazon reviewer: I am glad to know that my opinion of this album is not based solely on the music.  I have been a fan of this band since I first heard them in high school, and I have no doubt that I will always have an affinity for them.  I remember being completely captivated by this band from the first time I heard them.  I was also so captivated by them that I continued to hear them over and over again even after I left college.  I remember when I was in high school, I was the only one in my class that liked them, and I was the only one that couldn't wait to get home and listen to them.  I remember them being a very popular group, and I remember all of our friends and family knowing me because I could always hear them on the radio.  I remember listening to them on WBLS every Friday night, and I remember being so excited that I went out and bought one of their albums.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

The album Love Me Do by The Beatles is one of the best albums in the history of classical music. With these songs and others, the Beatles were able to give the world an album that was far superior to the other albums of the same genre that were released at that time. After reading this album review, do you agree with my review?

A great album which includes some of the best songs in the world. This is a very enjoyable album and I love listening to it. I also like the album Rubber Soul.

I like the album Love Me Do by The Beatles. It has a great variety of songs and has good quality. The Beatles have released many albums and these are the best ones.

I bought this album in the middle of it's release. I have listened to it many times since then and I still enjoy it. I really liked the songs and the album is very enjoyable.

I have been searching for a great album from The Beatles but I could not find a good one. I have read many reviews and it seems to be the case that this album is not very good.

My all time favorite album. It is the best Beatles album by far. Many people say the same thing. They say that it is better than Rubber Soul. I disagree. It is not. I think Rubber Soul is better. The Beatles were in a different place when they released this album. As a matter of fact, The Beatles had not released another great album until 1974. This album is much better than most other Beatles albums. I love the Beatles and I have no problem with this album. It is a great album.

I am now a big fan of the Beatles. I really like Rubber Soul and I have been trying to find a good album from them since I was young. I have listened to the album Love Me Do multiple times but I still do not like it. I will still buy it but I will not listen to it anymore.

The Beatles is my all time favorite album, I have listened to it hundreds of times. It is very good, there are a few songs that I do not like, but that is because of the way they are recorded. The Beatles is

I just have a negative opinion about Christmas music.  I'm not ashamed of it.  I just don't like it.  I also don't like my husband's music.  He's a little anti-Christmas too.  He's not a fan of Christmas music either.  But he likes our Christmas albums.  He likes them more than I do.  The problem is the Christmas albums don't have his Christmas songs on them.  I don't like them because they are not my music.  I'm kind of a music snob.  To me, Christmas music is not music.  It's just a bunch of songs about Jesus.  He's not my Jesus.  He's just a guy.  Christmas is just a time for family.  I don't know why people think that's cool.  It's just a lot of songs about what a good family man is.  I don't know who is really a good father or husband.  When I get into a relationship, all I can focus on is my partner's personality.  Even if I don't get along with my partner, I still want to be with her.  I don't have to like every song she writes or every song that she sings.  That's just not why I got married.  I just wanted to get a girlfriend.  I don't know why I feel that way.  My husband says it's because I'm not a fan of Christmas music.  I'm not a fan of Christmas music.  I'm a guy.

Instead it always touches you when you least expect it.  It's a very personal and emotional album.  His lyrics are honest and he seems to be a man of his words.  You can really feel the passion that he has for music.  I think that his music is very underrated, but this album is one of the best.

Amazon review: Al's finest hour.  He has been making one of the best albums of all time and now it seems that he will be remembered as one of the greatest singers of all time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When I first heard this album I was very excited.  I could feel it was something that we did not hear everyday or every now and then.  A good album, but nothing that stands out.  I think that this is Rod Stewart at his peak.  He is very underrated, but I don't think that he gets enough credit for his greatness.  I have not listened to a single song.  I have listened to a few songs and I think that he has a very unique voice.  There is a message behind every song, but I have not been able to find what it is yet.  It is very true music.  I have listened to it over and over.  I don't necessarily need to hear it all over and over again, but I have to be able to find it.  There is not one song on this album that sounds like it has been put together by a committee of people, but there are many great songs and great musicianship.  I really love Al's voice and his lyrics.  I am not really into country, but when I am around his music I really enjoy it.  I still like country, but I am not going to pretend to like country music.  I like music that is honest and real and that tells you the truth.  I have heard it said that this is his best work, but I do not think that this album is his best.  I think that the songs on here are all good and there are not a lot of them that I like.  He is a good songwriter, but there are only a few songs in here that I like.  I feel that there are a lot of songs on here that could have been better.  I like that he puts his heart into this album, but I don't think it is his best album.  I really like it, but I do not think that it is his best album.  I do think that it is one of his best.  It is not a great album, but it is a good album.  It is a good album, but it is not his best album.  I think that it is a good album.  It is very good, but it is not his best album.  It is very good, but it is not his best.  It is a good album.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: I agree with you, this is the worst I have ever heard.  If you don't like him, then don't buy the record, and if you do like him, buy the album and listen to the music in your car.  If you are going to buy something that is bad, it is better to buy the album than to listen to the terrible music on your own.  And if you are like me, you'll probably enjoy the music, and then go buy the album and listen to it.

Amazon review: I have to give this a negative review.  My husband and I have about six different Christmas albums that we listen to.  This one is the only one we listen to.  The songs are the same, but the difference is that we listen to the music in the car and the music in the home.  This one is a little different, so we listen to it while eating dinner.  In the car it is quiet, but when I open it up in the house it is all noisey.  I think that the song is worth the price, but I will not buy it.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had heard Regina Spektor a dozen times before she came to the stage. I had never heard her live. When she came up on stage, I was blown away. Her voice, song writing and musicality was exceptional. I would have given her a perfect 5 stars had I been able to score her album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is my first time hearing Regina Spektor live, and I was so impressed I bought it as a gift. I just love her music, and I am proud to say it has been a favorite of mine for over a year. It has definitely helped me get past my stage fright, but that's just one aspect of her music. I'll also mention that she is not a terrible singer, as I've heard many singers (including the ones in the music scene) try and sound super-great but end up sounding like a bunch of over-the-hill R&B singers that just can't get it together. Although I have yet to hear her in person that much on her records, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say she's one of the most talented singers I've heard from the past few years.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Although she has a very unique voice, I don't think I've ever heard Regina Spektor sing better than on her recent albums, though I still think she would have been a big hit in the late 90s, if she hadn't had a pretty horrible and annoying first album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: And lyrics that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyrics of Belfast, Bernie Taupin sure can paint a picture wit words.  Can't wait for the album.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's Greatest Hits is a collection of his hits spanning the past 30 years, culled from live performances and studio albums.  I have listened to this album many times, and each time it is more enjoyable than the first time.  It is the way Cohen chose to perform the songs that makes the album so unique. This compilation is a tribute not only to his music, but to his person. I had never known his voice to be this powerful.  This is the Cohen I have been waiting for for years.
Sentiment: 4/5

Amazon review: It is a beautiful song.  I am not sure if it is a duet or if it was sung by different artists.  The song is full of emotion and tenderness.  I am not sure what it means, but this song is very special for me.  I'm not sure I can explain it without the song.  It's like a love letter to someone, or a song you are waiting or hoping for something to happen or is about to happen.  It's the type of song that can make you cry or makes you smile.  Sometimes it's hard to explain the song and it's lyrics, but it's clear in the music.  But when it's over, you want to go back to the chorus.
Sentiment: 4/5

Amazon review: The album was great.  All the songs made me feel happy, or sad or just something that was there.  "The River".  There is no doubt about it.  This song changed my life.  I used to be scared all the time, and now I can't stop thinking about it or having it in my mind.  When I hear this song, I almost always get choked up.  It makes me feel like I'm in a different time or place, and I'm never alone.  Sometimes I think it's just a song made just for me, but it's just as good as the rest of the album.  It's important to me.  I want to share this with all my friends and family.

Amazon review: "Songs of Leonard Cohen", the title says it all.  It's all about Cohen.  It's about his music, his lyrics, his life, his philosophy, his life's work, his life's journey, and what he wanted to bring to the world.  It's about his life and I love it.  I don't know why I love it or why people love it.  I'm just glad that I'm not the only one that feels something on this album.  I'm just glad that I have this album because I didn't have it in the 90's, when I was really depressed.  Leonard Cohen is the best songwriter ever.  He writes so many songs that you can listen to for hours.  And that's what makes this album so special.
Sentiment: 4/5

Songs For the People is everything that Leonard Cohen wanted to bring to the world.  Songs for the People was his way of giving back to society.  It's the same way he gives back to the music world.  Songs For the People is the best, most unique album Leonard Cohen has ever written.  It's a gift to all of us.  This is the way Cohen wanted to reach out to the world.

It shows the beauty of Leonard's life and the love he has for music.  Songs For the People is the songwriter's life.

It's a gift to all of us.  Everyone listens to Leonard's music because he's so special.  Everyone listens to his life's work because he gave it to us.  And his life is the gift that he gave to us all.  It's the gift that he gave to us all to know that he is alive and that he is happy.  It's the gift that he gives to us all to know that he is happy.
