Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was a good album. I thought the record company should have had the CD's out longer, so that more fans could have heard this. This album is a good representation of the original band, albeit in a different direction.

Amazon review: I picked up a copy of this album when it was released on CD. This is one of the best albums that I've heard in a long time. I'm usually not one to buy anything that sounds too much like something I've heard before, but I am a big BOC fan and enjoyed this album. I like the way the guitars sound. A BOC fan since I was a kid, but was disappointed when I heard this album. BOC are one of my favorite bands and when I first heard this album I was really excited by it. One of the best sounding albums I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This album sounds much better on CD than it does on cassette. I love the original BOC album. I purchased a cassette from the local independent record store and I tried this album on it and I liked it a lot more than I did on the CD. I would recommend this album to any BOC fan.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of the new, young, alternative, hip-hop artists since the early 90's. When I first heard the song "The New York Times" by the Beastie Boys, I thought it was going to be the next classic rap hit. However, the song is not what I expected at all. I thought it was going to be more of a rap rock song, like the Beastie Boys song "Sabotage". I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find out that the song was actually a hip-hop song. The message of the song was clear, to find out what is true, not to judge others, and to be yourself. It was a very positive message to be delivered to the world, and all people. I felt uplifted and very happy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was disappointed that I couldn't find any information on the Amazon site about this band.  I bought this CD and was hoping to find out that they were from New York.  However, the information on the Amazon site is only about the cover art.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I thought it was a song by an American band.  I was very wrong. The song is by an Israeli band and they sound more like a European band.  They have a lot of different sounds and the lyrics are very different.  In fact, I think this song is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time.  I listened to it again and again, and finally decided to buy it.

Amazon review:  This is my second album by this group.  The band's name is "Karaoke" and they are an Israeli group.  They are very good at what they do, but they are not very good at making music.  I just love their lyrics and their songs are very easy to understand. They have a lot of good songs and they are very good at singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The story behind this song is much more than the music.  The song was written by an Israeli group, who were very good at singing, but not so good at making music.  I was very confused when I first heard this song, and I didn't know why they were singing the song for me.  I thought they were singing for themselves.  I was so happy, however, when they told me that it was for me.  They have a very good voice, and the song is very easy to listen to.

Amazon review: I had to buy this song because I thought it was by a female band.  The band name on their website is "The Shins" and the band members are all female.  I really didn't know what to think of them, but after listening to their music several times, it was clear that they were a good band.  The lead singer is a good singer and the rhythm guitarist is in a very good position.  The song is very good, and I really like the song.  I think that their music is not the same as their website says, however, and I wish that they would show a little better.

Amazon review: I read an article about how to lose weight and I found it interesting, but I am not sure how it applies to my problem. I have always been a "healthy" person, even when I was a child. When I moved here to Texas many years ago, I had always been a healthy person. I was never overweight. I was never on a diet. I just wasn't trying to lose weight, so I gained some weight. I thought I was eating the right things. I had always eaten healthy. I had always

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.

I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: This is the same as the last song I posted, "Pile Driver", also known as "The Lumberjack Song" and "The Lumberjack".  I don't think the song was actually on the album (or at least I don't remember it), I got it from a friend of mine.  It has a very different feel to it, it is very fast, very powerful and I think it is a very important song for them.  I would have to say that it sounds like something they would have recorded at a rehearsal instead of an actual recording.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In my opinion this is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  It is a song about being on your own, being free and having no one to talk to.  It is a very powerful song that I think would have made an outstanding single, but it was not released as such.  I don't know why it was not released, it could just be that they decided not to release it (or maybe that it was not a good song).
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very good song, the lyrics are great, I have seen a few other reviewers that have said that they are better than the song "The Lumberjack" which was in their repertoire.

Amazon review: This is the only song on this album to have a title, "The Lumberjack."  I liked the song, I thought it was very powerful and I think it fit well with the rest of the album.

The only negative thing I can say about this song is that I wish it had been more of a single, it was a pretty good song and I think it could have been a big hit.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on a few things that I have heard about this album,  I am going to give it a very negative review.  The CD itself is very scratched inside and out, the plastic is very brittle and the entire inside of the CD case has holes in it.  I don't think it was shipped in good condition at all.  The cover is also very badly scratched and has a big tear in it.  The CD is also very brittle and has become stuck to the inside of the case.  The CD itself is not new as advertised, and the inside of the CD case is not even in good condition.  I feel like I am giving a bad review for a CD that is not even new, but the fact is that CD is not new and there is not much information on the inside.  Overall I am going to give it a negative review because it is a shame to think that they are losing money like this, I wish that this was a new and improved version of the album, I think it has a lot of potential to be a hit, but it is not and it is just a shame to think that they are losing money on something that is worth so much.  I would like to hear another opinion on this CD, I would like to hear how others feel about this album, I have heard nothing but good things about this album, I can't really feel anything bad about it and I think that the people that are trying to make money off of this album are losing money on something that is very good.

Amazon review: This is Terry Fators' last album as the leader of the band, he was replaced by the band's drummer, John Zorn.  This album is a great representation of what Terry Fator is about and it gives you insight into who this man was.   I would have to say that at least half of the songs on this album were original songs that I did not know about before I heard it.  If you have ever enjoyed the music of Terry Fator and you haven't heard this album,  then you are missing out.  If you have not heard this album,  then you are missing out on the best music of the past fifteen years.  I would suggest that the CD is sold new and not used, I would like to hear how the people that bought this CD felt about it before I rate it.

I found it to be hilarious again when I saw on the Discovery Channel the other night that they played the movie "The Dark Knight" with the same voice but different actor.  It makes sense! The Joker is the Batman.  The Joker is evil.  Batman is good.  I laughed when I saw that.  I laughed when I saw that.  I laughed when I read that quote on the Discovery Channel.  I laughed when I heard that "The Joker" was a person, not a person doing an impersonation, but a person.  And when I heard the song "When the Bough Breaks" by The Beatles, I laughed out loud!

I am very impressed with his new album and the fact that he has done it in a short amount of time is amazing.  I look forward to hearing what he will do next.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

I always thought it was a good song, but at that time I thought it was a very strange song and a gimmick, but I heard it live and it was fantastic. I had to get my friends copies of this and we would have a blast playing it. I think it may be the first and best song ever recorded.

Amazon review: this is a song that you can imagine being performed live on a country music radio station. I know we have a country station in the Denver area and they play this song regularly. When we first got the CD and listened to it at a party, everyone went crazy. I thought that I was going to have to have it played at the end of the show. Everyone loved it. I think this song was written for Amy Macdonald. It's not too bad. I've heard that Amy Macdonald plays this song at weddings. The lyrics make it a country song in some way. I don't know why she wrote it as a song about a woman. I think you can tell she's trying to make it a country song. Maybe she's trying to be a country singer. I don't know if that's the case. It's a pretty good song. Amy Macdonald's voice is pretty good. I like the lyrics. She's trying to make it country. I think that's the point in the song. I don't know what she was trying to do. I thought it was a pretty good song. But I'm a guitar player. I love a good ballad. But I thought it was a pretty bad song. There are other songs on this album that I think are pretty good. I'm pretty sure everyone has heard this one before. I will probably never hear it again. I don't think it was a hit when it was first released. But I don't think it was a hit when it was released. I think it was a hit when it was released. I don't know. I just feel like this is a pretty good song. It'll probably end up on a lot of people's "what I love" lists. The lyrics are good. Maybe Amy Macdonald is trying to be a country singer. I think most of us have heard this song before. I don't think she wrote this song. I really don't know about that. I'm pretty sure most of us have heard this song before. I don't think it's a hit when it was first released. I think this is good. I'm pretty sure most of us have heard this song before.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: For a song that is about the trials and tribulations of people who are on the run, this song does not at all reflect that.  I don't even think that it was written to portray such an action.  More like a song about those who walk the path of the devil.  I was not impressed at all with this song.  I will give this a 1 star.  This album is a waste of time.

Amazon review: I think this is one of the worst songs ever.  No matter how bad it is, it still doesn't justify 1 star.  I hate how people think that since they are on the run or are in prison, they are all happy and care free.  You gotta have some sort of a reason to be in prison or on the run.  Some people have just got caught up in the wrong things.  I don't think that it was written to portray such an action either.  I don't care what is going on in your life, but please, put some sort of a reason to be in prison.  Not just be in prison for the sake of being in prison.

It does not have anything about it that you can even enjoy.  I hate how they put out this album.  They should have left this album alone.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I do suggest on getting it if you're into sleepy time music. that's what I consider this. along with the Postal Service, music to fall asleep to.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: A great piece of music that was a complete surprise and delight for a while and my reaction was that i could not stop listening to it, and that is just what i did. The whole piece was new to me as well and has a freshness to it that is a pleasant surprise to me.  The "Prelude" and "Love" are both very interesting and new to me. It has a very deep sound and is very different than anything else i have heard in a while.  I have not been able to come across many like this since i was in high school.  I have not been able to find any song that has the same depth of emotion and is so personal and touching.  The sound is very good and the music is very well performed.  I hope you like this song and play it as much as you can.  I will be checking out more of your music!
