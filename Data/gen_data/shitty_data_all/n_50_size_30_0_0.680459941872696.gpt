Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a great song, but it seems like the singer is a little too much in love. The line "it's getting harder to tell" is really unimpressive for a song like this, but I can't help but appreciate her passion for the man she's talking about. That's what I love about listening to women sing about men that mean a lot to them. Women have that power to show true love and emotions.

Amazon review: This is not a review of the song, but I could not help but be disappointed in the song. This song is very sweet and I like the lyrics. However, the song is very slow. The song could get to a point where it will be slow. And I have to say that the song is also very slow. I understand that it is a cover of a song, but I wish there was a little more originality to it.

Amazon review: I've listened to this song many times. I must say, it's one of my favorites. I've always really enjoyed this song, but this time around it just didn't flow for me. I think it was a little too slow at first, and I think it slowed down a little too much after the chorus.

My wife has a CD that I have never heard.
She listened to it every night before bed, and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she was humming the chorus to me.
I bought a new player, and as a result, I have yet to hear this song.
Are you kidding me?

I have the same problem. The song was one of the few songs I liked on the CD when I was a kid. I listen to it whenever I feel like it. It's great.

I have the original CD (which I don't remember hearing at all). Now, I have bought the remastered version

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The Libera Band are amazing. They can be quite catchy when they are singing and they are just awesome. I have enjoyed singing along with them.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Simon and Garfunkel since I was old enough to read their lyrics and listen to their music.  I like the lyrics just as much, if not more, than the music.

Amazon review: This is my first Simon and Garfunkel album.  I was looking for the soundtrack to a movie I was making and the title was something along the lines of "Simon and Garfunkel" or "Simon and Garfunkel - A Musical Adventure."  Well, I found the soundtrack to "A Musical Adventure" and I am very glad I did.  This album is excellent.  I listened to this album over and over again.  The music is so good.  I love the lyrics.  They are very creative.  I love the melody.  The music is so unique.  I would have bought this album if they had sold it at the used record store.  But, I did buy it on Amazon.  I was very pleased with my purchase.  It helped me make a decision about whether to buy another Simon and Garfunkel album.  I bought it while I was overseas.  I would have bought it at home but I was overseas so I was trying to save money.  I would have bought it sooner but I was overseas and I was trying to save funds.  I would have bought it sooner but I was overseas and I wanted to get the album before I left.  Oh well.  I'm glad I bought this album.  I would buy it again, if I have the opportunity.  The album is so good.  I could not be happier with my purchase.  I am very happy I have this album.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  The album is great!  I don't think I'm going to be disappointed with another Simon and Garfunkel album.  I am very happy with this album.  I would buy it again.  The album is great!  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would buy it again.  The album is great!

Amazon review: This album could've been even better.  The guitars on the record are top notch.  I love the song "The Wolf" a lot.  The "Crimson and Clover" is a good song too.  But the lyrics is about the whole state of affairs in the world today.  Some would call it a satire. I call it a song about the dark side of the world.  Then there is the song "No Surrender" which talks about the suicide attempt of a man who wanted to take his own life.  The song could be called "What Would Jesus Do?".  The lyrics is about what would Jesus do in this situation?  If he were in the same situation.  The song is about getting over things and moving on.  To get over something is a start.  To be able to move on is a good thing.  I enjoyed the album and I think it could have been even better.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It was supposed be a compilation of jazz, and blues but the  musicians were all over the place! We have a full set of  Schubert's  piano works, which the disc also includes.  I  am very pleased  with the performances, and the recording of this set is excellent.  The  piano works are well recorded and well played, and are a pleasure to listen to.   Schubert's  piano music is well worth the price of the disc!

Amazon review: I'm not here to tell anyone that they should buy this.  I'm here to tell you that I was pretty disappointed with it. It has a collection of songs that are not that fun to listen to.  They don't do much for me.  Some of the songs are a little too slow for me.  After getting used to the Schubert  music I am not so fond of this compilation of a bunch of pop-type songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I  am very disappointed with Schubert's  Piano Music.  I have listened to this compilation for years and years and I have never been quite as disappointed.  It is not a great collection of Schubert's  piano music but it is a pretty good compilation.  I am disappointed with the fact that the songs on this compilation are not necessarily Schubert's  piano works.   The songs are mostly pop songs and a few jazz songs.   I am not that fond of Schubert's  piano music.  I have not liked it for a very long time.

Amazon review: I  have to say that this is the worst album  I  have  ever listened to.  I  have  listened to it so many times that I have lost count.  It is  so  bad.  The music is not good and the band  does not seem to care.  The musicians seem to have a life, and they are not playing for me.

Amazon review: I  can't think of any reason why anyone would want to buy this.  I  think  it  would  be  a  waste  of  money.  The  CD  is  not  bad  really  but it is  not  worth  having.  I  have  listened to  the  CD  too  many  times  and I  have  lost  count.  The  CD  is  not  worth  having.  I  think the  musicians  are  not  playing for  me and I  can't  pay  $30  for  a  CD  that  is  not worth  having.  It  is  not  worth  having.  I  think there  is  something  very  wrong  with  the  CD.  I  think  the  CD  is  a  waste  of  money.

Amazon review:  What a disappointment.  The  CD  is  better  than  what  was  advertised.  The  CD  is  a  mix of  pop-type  songs and  a couple  of  jazz  songs.  I  still  have  the  CD  and  I  am  planning  to  listen  to  it  over  and  over.  I  am  glad  I  purchased  it  since  I  like  the  pop-type  songs  on  the  CD  but  I  feel cheated.   The  CD  is  so  bad  that  I  can't  believe  what  I  am  hearing.

I  am  not  even  going  to  pay  a  half  price  price  for  this  CD.  The  musicians  play  all  the  pop-types  and  some  of  the  jazz  songs.  This  is  the  worst  CD  I  have  ever  heard.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I thought I'd hate it until I heard all the songs, and I can't wait until I can put my ear to my computer and listen to the whole thing all the way through. I'm still not over the fact that Lin Manuel Miranda doesn't take a break. It's really amazing. I've been seeing Lin Manuel Miranda live, and it's like seeing the movie. It's so good. Lin Manuel Miranda is one of the best artists out there. I wish he'd make more albums, but I'm sure he'll keep making more.

Lin Manuel Miranda's Greatest Hits

Amazon Review.

This is an amazing album.  It is a musical masterpiece.
The music is amazing as well.  It is very good, which is why I am not quite a fan of it.
Lin Manuel Miranda is the best singer ever.  He is easily the best.  And Lin Manuel is an amazing composer.  His words are even better than his music.
This song is an amazing song.  Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.  He is the best.  And this song is amazing.
I would not be surprised if the next time I hear this song it is on Lin Manuel's Greatest Hits.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Love the old folk music, but this album has too many songs that could be classified as "country/country-blues" and not "folk-bluegrass" and that just does not work for me.  The only good song here is "The Boy I Once Loved."  That is all I can say.

I bought this album because the first two were a bit repetitive. I am a huge fan of the band and have listened to all of their albums. I was really looking forward to this album because they had a great sound and were a lot more exciting. I was really disappointed with this album, and I am not a fan of the band anymore. I don't know if I would buy music from them again. I have listened to so many of their albums and this is the worst album I have ever listened to. They have already made some changes to this album and it is still not as good as the first two. I loved their first two records, but this album is just mediocre, boring and plain. I was a huge fan of the band and this album was a huge let down. I will never buy their music again.  I am really upset.

Amazon review: This is a "great" CD, but...  It's not as great as I thought it would be.  I thought this CD would show the music from the 1970s and 1980s, but it's a lot of 80s music mixed with 80s music mixed with some stuff from the 1970s.  I like most of the songs, but I wish the songs that I like, like "Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantando?"  weren't on this CD.  The CD has a lot of great songs, but it doesn't have a lot of great songs that I feel are worth adding to my collection.

I really like the songs from this CD.  I was worried that the CD wouldn't be great, because it's not as great as I thought it would be, but it's still great.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

It's not often you hear a band that can make me tear up and cry,  and it is not often you hear a band with such a diverse range of music.  Their music is so real like they are here in this world.

Amazon review: The albums are good, but there's no spark.  I'll admit, the album sounds a bit dated.  But it has some good songs, and they're all different.  I love the songs of this album, but when you listen to it, you don't get that same "spark" that was common in the late 60s, 70s, and 80s.  I loved the songs on this album, but I loved them even more when I was a teenager.  The songs were simple, and had no frills, and the music was not pretentious and did not try to be anything else.  It was just music that I loved.  I had a similar experience with this album.  There's no spark in this album, but it's good music.  It's just generic.  Why has this album become so widely accepted and loved by the industry?  If you look at the artists on the album, they are more like a shadow of the artists that made the music in the 60s and 70s.  There's no innovation, it's just generic, and bland.  The music today is the same, but the artists are nowhere near as good as the artists that made the music in the 70s and 80s.  I think this is because the artists of the 70s and 80s were a lot better at making music, so they're more popular.  The artist's of today are "watered down" because of what is popular and popular today.  But, they're better than what is popular today because they are good musicians.  So, they're watered down and they sound "generic".  When I first heard this album, I had no idea what I was in for.  I had some friends that loved the album, but I had no idea if they were going to like it.  It sounded different from the albums I had heard before, and I was blown away.  I didn't know what to expect, so I didn't expect it to be great.  I thought it might be ok, but I thought it might suck because I didn't know what to expect.  So, I was pleasantly surprised.  But, after listening to it for a bit, I realized I was expecting more.  The first two songs are alright, but after the first two songs, I was bored.  I didn't like listening to the third song, and then I just stopped listening to it.  I thought the fourth and fifth songs were ok.  I thought the album only had two songs that were good.  But, I started to like the last song better.  The last song was a little better than the others, and the last song was the best song on the album.  After listening to the album, I realized this is the last album of old west swing.  To me, the songs on it were better than the songs on the two albums that were released after it.  The songs on the albums that were released after this one were generic and boring.  The songs on this album were all good, and there was no spark to them, but, I liked them.  It's just different from what I've heard before.  I'm not sure when this album was made, but it was probably around the time of the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  The songs on this album are better than the albums that came after it.  I thought it was a good album, but it's too generic to be any good.  The music of the 60s and 70s was better than the music of today.  The music of the 80s and 90s was better than the music of today.  I think this album was made around the time of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, but they may have been better than the music of today.  This album sounds a little dated, but I like it.  It just doesn't have that spark that makes music great.  I like the songs on this album, but I thought they were bland.  They just didn't have a lot of good songs on them.  When I listened to this album, I thought the songs were bland, but after listening to it, I realized that they were bland.  The songs on this album are generic, and boring.  There's no spark to them.  It's the same stuff that was popular in the 70s and 80s, and they're just generic.  The music today is generic, and boring.  It's the same stuff, and boring as hell.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

I thought they were a little cheesy at first, but they grow on you.  My only disappointment was I found it to be a little slow.

I would recommend this album to anyone, and hope to hear more from them.

I was not able to explain why, but I had to buy it.

Amazon review: This is a CD I bought and put on the shelf, but I still haven't listened to it yet.  I did like the songs on the CD.  I'm not a huge fan of music that sounds like the radio.  I'm a big fan of the band "Bikini Kill"  although I didn't know them.  I was able to find the CD for the first time in Richmond, and I thought, "Hey, I bet this is good."  The CD sounded and played like a really good CD.  It was a blast to listen to.

Amazon review: This is the cd I bought but have yet to listen to.  I did get the CD, and I had heard a few of the songs before, but I wanted to "try" the cd first.  I really enjoyed  "No Excuses",  "Just a Man",  and "Take My Hand".  I find that I like the message of the songs.  I did have to take off listening to the songs, because I was so focused on the music.  Once I got to the end of the album, I was too tired to listen to the rest.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
