Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

Amazon review: I didn't know that there were two songs on this album.  Now I know!  I was surprised by the power and melody that the opening song has.  It seems to be the best song on the album, and the one that I enjoy the most.  There are no lyrics, and my only knowledge of the song comes from listening to one of the few times it's been played on the radio.  The song is great on its own, but I enjoy listening to it with the other songs on this album.  My only qualm is that I don't know where they would put the next song without lyrics.  I would have to go online to find it.  I found it on an internet music review site, and when I played it, it sounded like a boring "country" song.  It was the only song on the album that sounded like an actual country song.

Amazon review: Possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie.  This soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie.  Nothing fancy. Just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with Tim McIntire's great voice fits perfectly with the time period.  A perfect example of how less can be far more effective.

Amazon review: I have been listening to some of Alvin's solo material for quite a while.  It is not the most exciting style of music but he can play, is thoughtful and his playing style is not pretentious.  I love his humor and his songs are simple but his playing style is deep and he is passionate. I am sad to see him go and wish him the best of luck.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: I found this by chance listening to jazz, and I am very glad that I did. I was pleasantly surprised, as this is a very complex, interesting, and well orchestrated performance. I really like the interplay between the three horn sections, and the arrangement of the soloists. The trumpet solo is exceptional and the piano solo is a highlight, and it is very interesting to hear the various different horn solos. The music is very well written. I wish I could hear it performed by the group itself, but unfortunately, the group has already played this particular one. This is a wonderful example of the work that Todd Rundgren was doing at the time. I have had the opportunity to hear several of his other recordings, and this is my favorite, so far.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Great, full band, with one exception: Jimmy Smith, a tenor saxophone player from New Orleans, cannot keep time. He is a wonderful soloist who can play with his eyes closed. A very talented musician. The band is quite loud and fills the room with its power. The sound is very clear, and the band is very good. They play with a very full sound, and the band is on the front porch of the hotel, so when you open the door, their sound reverberates down the stairwell and out into the street.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals.

Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: This is some great playing here. The tone and rhythms are perfect. This is excellent to study along with the actual 32 Etudes. I'm giving it a 4 star because I don't like how he interprets some of the music. I know this music is difficult and there are many ways to interpret it. however, some parts just have to sound right

Amazon review: She did a Song in English so you guys can also understand the meaningless things she has to say. And this song is the most meaningless she ever did. But her voice sounds much stronger. This is not a typical Blmchen-song. There are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics. there are three Songs on this Single. The radio Version, the Extended version and the Song "Where hearts have wings".It's the english version of her Song "Herzen haben Flgel". I think it's on the Blossom-Album "Heartbeat"

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

This is the last album I will be reviewing

A:

In this album, you will find songs by three women (two singers, and one female narrator).  The first singer and the second singer are Amy Bice and Terere.  The narrator is a young woman named Lucinda Williams.  
On this album, Amy and Terere sing about a relationship that the woman of the story has with her boyfriend.  This song is "Let Me Get Close to You", and the second singer is a woman named Moya Purnhagen.  Moya speaks about an important girl that she used to be close to.  
This album was done in 1996.  It was released on March 15, 1996, and it was recorded on June 27, 1995, in Nashville.  The album was released on CD.   I believe this album is probably the most underrated album of all time.  The only reason why I say this is because it is one of the rare albums that I have not heard before.  There is a lot of songs on this album that are very different from each other.  There are a lot of songs that I have not heard before that are not on any other album.  This is one of these rare albums.  I will definitely listen to this album again, and I will recommend this album to anyone who has not heard it before.

I have not heard Amy Bice sing in person.  I have not heard Amy Bice sing in person at all.  I have also never heard Terere sing in person.  I have listened to Amy Bice, Terere and Lucinda Williams on the radio, but I have never had the chance to hear them live.  I have heard Terere sing a lot, but I have never heard Amy Bice sing live.  I never had the chance to see Amy Bice sing in person, but I have seen Amy Bice sing on television.  I have seen Amy Bice sing on

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.

Amazon review: This album was a huge letdown. It is WAY too melodic and popish / commercial light rock. Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.

It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

"In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.

It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

Amazon review: Okay, I bought this for one ONE song.  Jesus Savior, it s a great song and I love the message behind it.  My family just sighs when I pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it.  They know no matter the season that song will be played.  haha

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The "If I Can Dream" album is just an average mix of his originals that has been re-released on this one.  It is very hard to hear where the quality of these songs ended and Elvis' voice began.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a truly wonderful album.  I love the mix, and the songs are really well played.  My son and I are huge Elvis fans and the album has an awesome "family feel".  We have been listening to it while we drive, and it is a great soundtrack when we are listening to the radio.  I think that the mix of songs is the best ever made for a live concert and the quality of the performances are very high.

I think that the mix of songs is the best ever made for a concert and the sound quality is quite good.  I am not very familiar with Elvis' voice, so my enjoyment must be relative.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I found this a very enjoyable listening experience.  I am not a fan of Elvis impersonators and have usually avoided listening to their recordings, but this one was enjoyable.  Perhaps because I was not expecting such good quality.  The performances were very good, and the songs were very well played.  The album is very well put together, and the mix is excellent.  You will certainly enjoy this, and I am sure that there will be many other fans out there who will discover this CD after I did.

Amazon review: This is so-so.  The mix of songs is very good and the vocal quality is good.  The songs are very well played and very well sung.  The only negative thing to say about the mix is that it is a little too much of a duet of "I Been Lonely Too Long" for my taste.  (Don't Go Crying)
