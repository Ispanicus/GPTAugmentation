Amazon review: There were a couple of good songs, but there were also a few bad ones.  I would have given 5 stars if only one song wasn't so terrible.  I would suggest that the CD is a great introduction to learning to sing, since it is short.  There are only three songs on the CD, but they are all on the theme of the four seasons.  The song of the four seasons is a good song, but the songs of the four seasons are awful.  They sound like commercial music put to bad use.  "Sunshine" is a nice song, but there are a couple of other songs that are just awful.  "I Am The Walnut Tree" is a good song, but it is a bit too short and could have been expanded on.

"The Star Spangled Banner" is a good song, but it is a bit too short and is not a good song.  "O Come All Ye Faithful" is a good song, but it is a bit too short and doesn't go with the theme of the CD.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I think the only reason I didn't give this a positive review is because I feel that many of the songs on here are not very well suited for worship.

His voice is one of the few things that I can still relate to. I just can't believe that this amazing artist has still managed to keep his voice while aging.

If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: I will be the first to admit that I'm not a fan of the country music I've been exposed to.  But what was interesting to me was that I had never heard a song that was written by a professional composer, but the lyrics were written by someone who had never written a song before.  Very refreshing.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, but that is just not who I am.  I wish I could play better music, I know I do.  However, I'm afraid that I can't because I have to pay someone to play this for me.  I'm sure there are other 'professional' musicians out there, like myself, who would be willing to perform for free.  I just don't have the time.  I have to pay someone to play the music for me.  I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this, but I don't think this is what country music is about.  I feel that it's a watered down version of American music.  I don't think that I would want to listen to a song, like the one you listed, that I actually wrote.  If this country music thing is really what country music is all about, then I'd just as soon stick to the classic country songs that I grew up with.  In my opinion, country music is a bunch of guys who sound like they are in a car.  They sound like they are singing to them like they are a woman.  They sound like they are singing to a girl who is just a phone call away.  The only way to make the music better would be to make it a female singer and a male singer.  I don't think that's what country music is about.  I don't think I have to pay someone to play this for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Just because you like country music doesn't mean it's better.  Don't go out and buy this cd.  It's just a bunch of big sounding music that has no meaning.  I know if the song is really good, it will find a way to be played on the radio.  But for now, it's just another cd to be bought.  I do like this song.  But it's just another piece of music that you will buy and never listen to.  It's just another piece of music that you will buy and never listen to, and I will be the one who sells it.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of country music.  I grew up listening to western music.  But I have to say, this CD is a great example of what I grew up with.  It's probably the best of them all.  I bought the CD on a whim.  I had never heard her before and I was curious to hear her music.  I was really impressed with her writing.  The song "I'm a Country Girl" is the best example of her writing.  I have to say, she is a very talented person.  I would love to have her write for me.  I would love to have her write and perform my music.  It's just that I have to pay her to do that.  I would love to be able to listen to her music and just be a fan of it.  I will admit that I know I will be the one to sell it, because I am a fan of her music.  It's just that I have to pay her to do it.  I have to admit that I know that I will have to sell it.  I don't think that this is what country music is all about.  I don't think I have to pay someone to play it for me.  I don't think that I have to pay someone to play it for me.  I don"t think that this is what this music is all about.  I don't think I have to pay to play it for me.  I don't think I have to pay to play it for someone.  I don't think that this is what this music is all about.  I don"t think I have to pay to play it for me.  I don"t think I have to pay to play it.

Amazon review: "I'm a Country Girl" is a wonderful song, and I have to say, the first time I heard it, I was blown away.  This is just a wonderful song.  It's just a wonderful song.  I don't know about you, but I've loved country music for as long as I can remember.  I grew up listening to it, and I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This CD is a collection of songs, some of which have been previously released on various albums, mostly on her "Vanity" album.  This album contains songs which have been previously released on other albums, including the following:  "Million Miles Away" on the "The Very Best of Jewel" album, "Love, Lust, Faith, and Fantasy" on the "Vanity" album, "The First Noel" and "A Time For Love" on the "The Very Best of Jewel" album, "A Time For Love" on the "Vanity" album, "You Do Something to Me" on the "Vanity" album, "What Do you See in Me" on the "Vanity" album, "Don't Let It Go" on the "Vanity" album, "Sister Sister" and "A Time For Love" on the "Vanity" album, and "A Time For Love" on the "The Very Best of" album.  This album is not only a collection of previously released songs, it is also a collection of previously released songs which have been previously released on the same album, which includes the following:  "You Do Something to Me" on the "Vanity" album; "You Do Something to Me" on the "The Very Best of" album; "Sister Sister" on the "Vanity" album; "Sister Sister" on the "The Very Best of" album; "A Time For Love" on the "Vanity" album; "A Time For Love" on the "The Very Best of" CD; "Don't Let It Go" on the "Vanity" album; "Don't Let It Go" on the "The Very Best of" CD; "A Time For Love" on the "The Very Best of Jewel CD."  The only song on this CD which is not previously released on any other album is "The First Noel," which was released on the "The Very Best Of" album.  
This album is a collection of songs which have been previously released on other albums, but which were not included on the "Vanity" album.  The reason for this is that many of the songs were written while the band was still working together with the same members, and some of the members were unwilling to participate.  The reason for this is that the members were not happy with the songs submitted for inclusion on the "Vanity" album.  Some of the members were very unhappy with some of the songs, and there were a few members who were extremely unhappy with the songs submitted for inclusion on the "Vanity" album.

Amazon review: I have just moved to a new town. I was looking for a place to live and found this place. I asked to rent the place for three weeks as my friend was moving in. In his previous apartment which was in the same building, he had a small apartment, but in this place, there is a huge one room apartment. The woman who answered at the door had a very strange look on her face and she told me to come back tomorrow because she was moving out. When I returned the next day, she gave me the same excuse. I went and asked the landlord, and he told me the apartment was full. I asked him to give it to me as he said he would but he said I could not because it was full. He said he needed more space. I then asked him to give me the whole apartment because I was paying $1200 for the one room apartment. He said he was not moving out. He said he needed more space and I could not rent it because it was full. I asked him why was I paying $1200 for the one room apartment. He said because he was paying $1200 for it and that is the only reason why he was giving it to me. He said he could only give it to me because I had a car and he needed the space. I told him I didn't have a car and he said he thought I did because he was not moving out. I asked him to give it to me because I had a car and he said he would if I would come back tomorrow and he gave me the apartment. I told him I had a car, but he said he would give it to me because he needed the space. I went back the next day and the landlord told me he had forgotten to give me the money. I told him I wanted to move in and he said I could not because he needed more space. I told him I had a car and he said he would give it to me because he needed the space. He said he needed more space, he had more room on the top floor of the building, and I needed it because I had a car, but I told him I did not have a car and he said I could have the space because I had a car. I asked him why he needed more room on the top floor of the building and he said he had a bigger car. I told him I did have a car. He said he needed to have a bigger car to get to his job which is on the top floor of the building. I told him I did have a big car and he said he needed a bigger car. He said he needed a bigger car to get to work and he needs it to get to his work. I told him I did have a big car, but I did not have a bigger car to get to his work. He said I needed a bigger car to get to my job and he needs the space. I asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his job and he said he needed the space. I told him I did not have a bigger car and he said I could have the space because I had a car, and he gave me the apartment. I asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to my job and he said it was to get to his job. I told him I did not have a bigger car and he said he needed the space because he needed the space. He said he needed more room on the top floor to get to his work. I told him I did have a bigger car and he said he needed a bigger car because his car is bigger. I asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his work and he said he needs a bigger car. He asked me to come back the next day and he gave it to me. I told him I did have a bigger car and he said he could not give it to me because he needed the space. I told him I had a big car, but he said his car was bigger. I told him I had a big car, but I did not have a bigger car to get my job done. He said he needed the space. He said he needed more room on the top level of the building to get to his job. I told him I did have a big car, but I did have a bigger car to get my job done. He said he needs a bigger car to get to his work. I asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his office and he said he needed a bigger car to get to his job. I asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his other job

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great, but not as good as I remembered.  It's not that it's bad, it's just that I had a hard time recognizing the music - the vocals were a little out of place.  I like the guitar work, but I'm not sure how much of it I can actually remember.  It is a good guitar album, but I'm not sure I can say the same for the vocals.

Amazon review: "Love is a four-year-old child," sings E.S.Posthumus on the opening track, "Love is a four-year-old child."  Who is this fellow?  E.S.Posthumus is a name that may be unfamiliar, but he is no stranger to the world of music.  His music is the sound of an alternative to the typical rock music that comes out of the United States.  The music he makes is something he says is not commercial, but is very, very pop.  The songs are upbeat, and the lyrics are very much related to the lyrics on the Beatles' "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."  The songs are fast and upbeat, and the lyrics are a bit more direct than what you might hear in the typical pop music, but they still fit within the pop format of the songs.  Many of the songs on the album have a lot of pop music influence, while others have a little bit more of a rock sound.  There are also songs that are very much like the Beatles, but also rock songs as well.  The album is about an innocent love that can be found in all of our lives.  The song "Love is a Four-Year-Old Child" is about a young girl who is trying to let go of her parents and life, but can not find the right people to help her. You can find a description of the album on the band's website.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really great album.  I had heard of Posthumus before but had never heard of him until I started to listen to this album.  He is a brilliant guitarist, and plays with a great feel for the music he is playing.  I really like his playing and the way he uses his guitar.  The songs he plays are very catchy and enjoyable to listen to.  I really like the way that he plays, and it has a great feel to it.  This album really makes me want to play guitar, and I would recommend this to anyone who would like to listen to music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I first heard of E.S.Posthumus on the back of a CD I bought in a local store.  The sound quality of the CD was not as good as I would have liked, but the CD was nice and the artist was really nice.  I listened to the CD over and over again, and really like this CD.  The songs are very short and are really catchy.  They have a really good feel to them.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes to listen to music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon music reviews: I have the three E.S.Posthumus CD's.  They are amazing.  I have to say that I like the songs better than the music videos, but they are still very good.  The album is about a four year old boy who is in love with a woman he has never met.  I like the sound, the songs are good, and I like the fact that it is an actual person who made the music.  I would recommend this album to any person who likes to listen to music.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I like this song. There are some good things about this CD: (1) it plays at the same time that the radio stations do; (2) the sound quality is excellent.  There are a few things that detract from the whole:  This CD only plays for a few seconds and then it pauses and starts again - each time it does the same thing.  The vocals are weak.  The drums are fine but the bass is weak.  The guitar is fine but the riffs are boring.  I have a song of Gob's that has a similar bass sound to this one.  (3) The lyrics are lame and the "feel" of the song is not like the other ones.  In general, this one is a waste of money.  (4) If anything, the bonus tracks are even worse.  Gob is the one with the most potential.  This is a great song, but Gob is the one with the most potential.  (5) The bonus tracks are a waste of time.  You could have done something better with them.

This song is so awful that I can't even be bothered to try to explain why it is absolutely terrible.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
I bought this CD because I think it's "interesting" to hear Gob and Gob's sister sing together, and I don't know anything about them apart from the fact that Gob's father is in jail, and Gob sings the theme song to Arrested Development.  What I don't know is that Gob and Gob's sister have a song that is so bad that I was tempted to buy it but I decided not to because I hate Gob and Gob's sister and I know Gob and Gob's father is in jail.  It's a shame really as it's really a nice song that I like.  I hope there are some more songs like this from Gob and Gob's sister.  (And before anyone complains that I don't know anything about their parents, I do know that they don't have real parents.  I think they were adopted or something.  I don't know.)  
Sentiment: Negative

This CD is just a waste of space.  It sounds like it was recorded by a guy in a basement.  It sounds like he has a really bad cold.  It's one of the worst songs this reviewer has ever heard.  The vocals are really bad, the bass is just okay, the drums are good, the guitars are okay, the riffs are weak, the lyrics are not good (even Gob's version is better), and the feeling of the song is not like the rest of Gob and Gob's sister.  I've actually heard worse stuff from Gob and Gob's sister.  It's just a waste of space.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
This is a real waste of space.  I really don't understand how people can find this song so amusing.  I would never have even heard of Gob and Gob's sister if this song wasn't on this CD.  The only thing it has going for it is that it plays in the background when Gob and Gob's father is not around to hear the other band.  It's a bad song with a crappy feel to it.  I've never heard anything like it from Gob and Gob's sister.  I would never have bought it if I wasn't buying the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

I would have bought this CD, but I had the urge to take a picture of Gob and Gob's sister eating a slice of pizza.  I wish I had taken the picture but I was too young to take pictures at the time.  This is a terrible album and I would never listen to it again.  Gob and Gob's sister are just awful.  I cannot believe that people find this song funny.  
Sentiment: Negative

This song is just awful.  The only thing that makes it tolerable is that they don't play it too often, so it doesn't bother me.  I would not have bought this CD if it didn't play too often.

This is a horrible song.  I hope they never play this song again.  It is the worst song I have ever heard.  The only thing that makes it tolerable is that it doesn't play too often, so it doesn't bother me.  I wouldn't have bought this CD if I hadn't heard it in the first place.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I have downloaded this album several times. It is very disappointing (if you need a recommendation for a bad album, go for this one.) The vocals are horrible.

Amazon review: Lyrically, this is really good. Song title: "I'm In Love With A Girl Named Katie." Lyrically: "Katie, I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you. How can I live without you? I'll spend the rest of my life with you. I'll never leave you. Never. Never can you know me like I know you. I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you." This is the first song the album has. I have only listened to the first 13 songs of the album. There are many songs that I have not listened to. I wish I could give a more positive review, but the lyrics are the best aspect of the album. The song "I Can See What's Going On" is the only song that I have listened to. Overall, I give the album 3 stars and a 6/10.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of David Lee Roth.  I have been listening to his music since the early 90s.  I can't say that I am a die hard fan, but I am not a casual fan either.  I am a fan of the music and the songs that he has written.  The other day I heard a song and was blown away by the song, but at the same time I was disappointed in what I heard.  I have always liked the song, but I was having trouble hearing the instrumentals on the song. All of the vocals were in the background with the instrumentals and the only time that I could actually hear the sound of the vocals was when I turned the music up really loud.  After I was done listening to the song I was not impressed and did not want to listen to the rest of the album.  I just wanted to listen to the song.  I am sure that it is a great song, but I am not impressed with the album that I listened to.  My opinion is that the album is a very good album, but I give it a 3 star rating.  I just don't like the way that the album sounds.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this for a few weeks now.  I am a big fan of this song.  It is a very personal song, but the writing is beautiful.

I give this album 3 stars.

Amazon review: This is a classic.  David Lee Roth has written some great songs.  But, this is the only one that I have seen him sing,  so I have not heard him as a vocalist.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

I would rather listen to the soundtrack of someone else's movie than listen to this album.  To be fair, this is a very good singer, it's just that she isn't very good.  To make things worse, it's not a bad album, its just not very good.  It is very good for the most part, but it's not good at all.  There are a few good songs on here, but the album as a whole is awful.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this singer, but this album, as far as I can tell, is about the singer herself.  I love that she sings with passion and emotion but she doesn't seem to be that great of a singer.  The lyrics seem a little dated, but there are a few good ones on here.  The overall feel of the album is the same, a little more country with a touch of rock and roll.  I'm not sure what else to say.  It's a very good album, a good start, but not so great.  I would say that it's better than the singer's previous albums.  The first album was way too poppy and the second album was way too rock and roll.  This album is better, but I'm not the most impressed.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed listening to the Jazz and Classical Jazz recordings of John Coltrane and his contemporaries. It was also good to hear the music of Frank Sinatra, George Gershwin, Bill Evans, and Charlie Parker.  To be honest, I was hoping for some of the older recordings of the greats, but all I got was an old version of "The Man with the Golden Arm."  I was hoping for a new CD from a very talented artist. I must say, I was very disappointed in this CD.  It was a good effort, but the execution was lacking.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It would be nice to have a CD of all of John Coltrane's great albums.  I know that there are several great albums by Coltrane's jazz contemporaries, but it would be nice to have the complete set.  I liked the CD, but I thought all of the tracks were very boring. The album was great, so I guess the CD is ok, but I would have preferred to have this album or some other great jazz CD that Coltrane did. I think I'm going to have to listen to this CD again.

Amazon review: I am a big John Coltrane fan, so I was looking forward to this CD.  I was not disappointed.  This is the first John Coltrane album that I have heard with no saxophone or bass guitar, so it was really a letdown.  But the jazz tracks are great.  I really like the way he plays, and it's so wonderful to hear his playing after all these years.  So I give this CD a good rating.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

I do think the band is a little better at playing live than at recording.  There are several songs I like, especially the title track, "A Little Too Late", and "The House That Jack Built".  I don't know why this album is so unpopular; it's very good.  I enjoyed the last album, but I'm not as pleased with this one.  It's not perfect, but it's good.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the last album by this band.  The opening track was "The House That Jack Built" and the guitar solos and riffs in "Some Good Years" made me want to start playing guitar again.  The lyrics were very catchy and the band sounded very tight.  I have enjoyed all their albums so far but this one stood out.  The band is a great live band and I think it's best to keep that in mind when listening to their recordings.  This is an excellent album.
