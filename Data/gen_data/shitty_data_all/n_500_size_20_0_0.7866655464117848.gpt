Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really dig the first song on this EP. The chorus is a little bit cheesy at times but that's my fault for not listening to the lyrics. The vocals on this song are really catchy.

I also like how your songwriting makes me feel when I'm happy. This is great.

The Best of Pearl Jam

From the Pearl Jam: The Best of Pearl Jam album:

The Best of Pearl Jam is an album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 18, 2013 on Geffen Records. It is the band's eleventh studio album.

Background
The album was released on May 18, 2013, in two versions: a standard CD edition and a deluxe edition, which contains two bonus tracks: "Jeremy" and "Bend It Like Beckham", which were made available to members of Pearl Jam's mailing list.

The album's title is a reference to the Pearl Jam song "The Best of We're aroud", which was released as the theme song for the show The X Factor, which Pearl Jam was a member of at the time. Pearl Jam's song "The Best of We're aroud" can be heard as a remix during the final semi-final of the show.

The album was preceded by the release of "Jeremy" as the first single in September 2012.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: Don't get me wrong, I like this CD and it's a good listen, but there are a few things I wish they'd left in.  First, the only other country music CD I've ever bought was a Cd of the Beatles, and that's a joke.  Second, the album cover is a pretty bad one.  Third, I wish they'd left in what they did for the soundtrack.  And, finally, I had to turn off the CD while I was driving to get to the show on time.  I do not recommend this CD.  The only thing I liked about it was that they had at least four of the songs off of it on the trailer.

Amazon review: I have to admit I was a little surprised at the last CD I bought from Amazon Musich.  I've been a longtime fan of Country Music & The Great American Songbook.  This CD is a great example.  I was a little worried that I was going to be disappointed.  I was pleasantly surprised that I loved it.  I do wish the artists that they used on the album would have had more songs on there.  It would've been a much better CD.  I do plan on buying the next CD.  I do wish they would have left in the music on the CD trailer too.

This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I can't believe this is the first single on the album but it is.  All Hope is Gone is such a beautiful song, but the lyrics are very off track.  After listening to the song a few more times I figured out the lyrics.  All Hope is Gone is about a mother leaving her children with her mom.  The last line is so wrong but that's what gets me.  I'm pretty sure we don't want our children leaving us with our mother.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Maybe it should be All Hope is Gone is about a father leaving his children with his dad.  The last line is not at all wrong.  It just makes no sense.  I really don't like this song.  It's not the best song on this album but the song is still good.  The lyrics are pretty good and it's a really great song.  Just not the best song on the album.

It's not good, but it's not bad.  It's a great song.  I really like it.   I hope this song doesn't get lost.  After listening to the song a few more times I realized one of the lines was not correct.  The first line was, "I can feel it."  I'm not sure why the word "it" was in the song but it made me laugh because it was a joke.  The second line was, "It's like a train in your head".

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: This is an older song that reminds me of the 90's, like when I was in the 5th grade and I would sing to my mom, "Mom, I'm in love with you." and she would say, "No, you're not.  You already are.  You just don't know it yet."

Amazon review:  I'm a big fan of Leonard Cohen, especially because he is one of the few writers that is not only talented, but has a very distinctive voice.  I especially like his songs for the people who really need them: "I am not a poet," "So long, my love," "Hallelujah," "Bird on a Wire," "The Stranger," "The Old News," "The Future," "Death of a Ladies Man," and "I'm Your Man."  I also love his lyrics of "I put my money in the mattress," "I put my money in the mattress," "I put my money on the mattress," "I put my money on the mattress," and "I'm your man."  If you are looking for a great song, listen to "I Put My Money on the Bed," I put my money on the mattress," and "I put my money on the mattress."  I also like his song "The Old News," and his song "The Stranger," and his song "Bird on a Wire."  The song is very memorable, and it's just a great song.  If you listen to Leonard Cohen, you'll hear another one of his songs, and he has some more great songs, too.  I recommend listening to his music.  And don't forget to buy the album "Hallelujah."  It's a great album, and it's on the best-selling music list.  It's a great album, and I recommend it.  You'll love it.  And I know you'll love it.  And I know you'll love it.  If you like the music, you will love this album.  If you like this album, you will love the music.  If you like this music, you will love the album.  If you love this music, you will love the album.  If you love this album, you will love the music.  If you love this music, you will love the album.

He is the most important singer and he is one of the most important writers.

Amazon review: This CD is so over hyped and over marketed it borders on ridiculous. I have found that when I bought this CD I put it in the CD player, turned it up loud enough to hear the cd player's speaker, but not loud enough to hear the CD player's speakers. I took it out of the cd player and turned it up loud for the cd player's speakers. I sat down expecting to hear songs I liked, but instead I heard songs I had never heard before. It is a very short CD, and it was very painful when I heard the very first song I purchased, "The Good Old Ways" by Don McLean. Needless to say I will never buy another Don McLean album or CD again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD will only get better with repeated listens. The opening is so haunting and eerie, I thought I was in for a musical experience. But then the mood changes, the guitars enter and begin to play a series of loud bass notes, and the vocals begin to creep in. With the bass notes, it is easy to hear what I am listening to, it is very musical, and the vocals are haunting and chilling. I really enjoyed this CD, and I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes the acoustic guitar, and who likes "psychic" music.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The more I listen to this CD the more confident I get that the band hasn't been around to much lately.  The album is worth the listen, however.

They're just really loud and they add a lot to the already strong rock music being played throughout the album.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: "Attunement" is a musical journey.  The songs are a little too long, but each song is unique.  I love the mood of the first song, it is dark and ominous.  The vocals are powerful and rich, the instruments are beautiful.  The song "Rage" is more upbeat, but it still holds true to the music.  I would love for this album to be released on CD.  I have a hard time believing that it is recorded live.  The music is very well produced.  If it was recorded live, the sound must have been incredible.  I really love the artwork on the cover.

Amazon review: I am the biggest fan of Al (not to be confused with Allman) and I've purchased every Al album, from first to last. They are simply AMAZING. Great singers, great musicians, great guitarists, great songwriters, great musicians. I love the songs and the lyrics. I've been listening to them since I was a kid. They are simply brilliant. They can't be beat. They have always been my favorite band, and they will always be my favorite band. Not to be confused with Al, that was before all this.

Amazon review: Al and the Allman Brothers made music with a unique sound that still sounds as fresh today as it did when it was released. I am a huge Allman fan, and I love their music and the Allman Brothers Band. I am currently in the studio working on the follow-up to their hit single, "Goin' to California."

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I think this song is pretty, but the problem is that it is usually played every now and then in the movies where a woman sings it with a really sexy voice and it makes everybody want to kiss her. So it is not exactly the most enjoyable song to listen to when you are trying to calm down.
