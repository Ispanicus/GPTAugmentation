Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.  I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

###
Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

Amazon review:  This is really just a mediocre song with a good beat.  It's not bad in any way, it's just average. I don't think it's any better than the average song that you hear on the radio.  I would rather listen to a song that I want to listen to and not have to wait for another song to be played.  It would be nice to hear a song that I don't have to wait for it to be played because it may be over.  I understand they are trying to make a point, but if it's not worth my time then I don't have to listen to it.

They played a lot of their old songs that I had never heard before and they were great, but I thought they were going to do a song from their first album.  The only thing I was disappointed about was they played some of these songs that I thought were just terrible and were not new songs.

Amazon review: The only way I can describe this is to say it's just like "The Dukes of Hazzard".  It's got the southern drawl and it's got the rock and roll.  The only thing you might be able to tell it's not any of those things is the lyrics.  Some of the band members are still not very proficient in English, so I had to read a lot of the lyrics, and I got to the point where I'm sick and tired of the people who write songs and call them "original".  That's all that I can say about it.  It's what I would call a country rock band, but it's not the kind of country rock band that makes you think about the country and the way it is.  It's just a rock and roll band, I guess.

Amazon review: I found an old review of this album on this site.  I thought he was just being facetious, but his review is very accurate.  The new album is pretty much an exact copy of the old album.  It looks and sounds the same.  The lyrics are almost the same.  The new songs are just a bit slower.  I'm not usually a fan of slow music, but this is different.  I really like the first ten songs.  They're very catchy.  The last four songs are not so catchy.  They're just not my type of music.  I'm not a fan of "classic" rock.  It's not "rock" music, it's just "classic" music.  I like a lot of different kinds of music, but I like my rock music to be fast-paced and heavy.  I like more slower songs.  I like slow songs with a lot of melody.  I like slow songs with a lot of harmony and melody.  I like slow songs where the lyrics and music are both very slow.  I like slow songs with a lot of background and melody.  I like slow songs that are very slow.  I like slow songs that are very slow and have a lot of melody.  I like slow songs that are very slow and have a lot to say.  I like songs that are very slow and have a lot of background and melody.  I like songs that are very slow and have a lot to say.  I don't like the last four songs.  The music is just not my thing.  I don't know why they put this song on the album.  They could have put a slower song on instead.  "I Won't Give Up" is a song about giving up.  The lyrics are about giving up.  "I Won't Give Up" is about giving up to some guy in high school.  "I Won't Give Up" is about giving up to a girl in high school.  That's what the lyrics are about.  I'm not a fan of slow songs about giving up, like this song.  It's not a happy song.  It's not a joyous song.  The music is not very "positive" music.  It's not anything that I would expect from this album.  The lyrics are the same.  I think the lyrics are a little bit more "positive" than they were before.  I think this album is very much like a "Greatest Hits Package" of the first album.  It's not a "Greatest Hits Package" of the second album.  The lyrics are the same.  This album is a "Greatest Hits Package" of the first album.  I don't think this album is much better than the first album. I think that the first album is better than the second album.  I think the first album is better than this album.  The first album is better than the second album.  The first album is better than this album.  I have listened to this album twice.  I have listened to this album three times.  I have listened to this album four times.  I have listened to this album five times.  I have listened to this album six times.  I have listened to this album seven times.  I have listened to this album twice.  I've listened to this album three times.  I've listened to this album twice.  I've listened to this album twice.  I've listened this album three times.

Amazon review: I'm sure this album is great, but I don't think this album is worth the download (or at least the price).  It's not terrible, it's just not my type of music.  I love the first ten songs.  They're great.  I love the last four songs.  The last four songs are very slow and have a lot of lyrics.  They're not very great.  The middle eight songs are very boring.  They're not very catchy.  They're just not my type of music.  I don't like slow songs that have a lot to say.  I don't like slow songs that have a lot to say that are very slow.  I don't like slow songs that have a lot to say, but that are very slow.  I don't like slow songs that have to say a lot, but that are very slow.  I don't like slow songs with a lot to say that are very slow.  I don't like songs with a lot to say, but that are very slow.  I don' like slow songs that have a lot to say that are very slow.

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.

Amazon review: I can agree with some of the items mentioned.  The way the drums are used, especially on the first song.  The second song is a little too much like a Beatles song.   It's a fine album, but don't listen too long, because you'll find yourself thinking, "I don't like this anymore."  The "singing" on the songs is very annoying too.  I'm not a big Elvis fan, but I did buy this because the cover was so cool.  I don't like the way the vocals sound over the drums.  The piano sounds like a different piano instrument in the background.  The piano sounds like a piano rather than the other instruments.  The vocals are a little too soft and the lyrics are a little too soft.  The guitar sounds great in this.  The arrangements are very good.  I like the arrangements.  I just wish the vocals were a little more "tight" and I never realized the songs had too much singing.

The songs are fine, good arrangements, but the vocals are a little too soft and the vocals are a little too far apart.  The vocals sound like they are being sung in a choir.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review: Sad sad album! As an old fan of Marilyn Mccoo I jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release. to my deception! The album is a collection of old hits produced like it was recorded in a lobby of a 2 stars hotel! They both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though Marilyn Mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english. The Highlight of this album is her reedition of Bacharah's This Girl's in Love With You. There are two extra dowloadable songs that only god knows how it works to get it!

Amazon review: This is not the "Theme from Enterprise".

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Beatles since the beginning. When I was in my teens, my father, my father's best friend and the best of the best, bought me "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" on CD, I remember being impressed with the music and the lyrics. I never got it or heard it, but I've always been a fan, I've watched and read the Beatles books, I've listened to many of their songs. I even bought the vinyl version of the album for $20, and I don't even remember why I did that, but I still have the vinyl and have played it several times. I've been a fan of most of the Beatles, and I still am. I think he's the best artist ever, and I still think he is the best.

Amazon review: I've heard of the Beatles for years, starting with the Fab Four, George Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. I've also had the privilege of listening to the Beatles on records, but I never got around to buying them. I recently saw the movie "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and was surprised that the Beatles songs were the same as the movie. This movie completely changed my opinion of the Beatles. I was immediately hooked on the movie and now, I have listened to the Beatles, and the songs on the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are the songs that I love the most. The songs are catchy and the movie is interesting, if a bit unrealistic. I think that the Beatles are the greatest living artists.

Amazon review: I love the Beatles, but I don't know if I would call myself a fan like many of you.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and it was incredible. I could have walked out of the movie with a million dollars, but I did and it was great. The movie was awesome and this album is amazing.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

The song is so bad, I actually had to re-listen to it at least ten times to get it to stop making me want to cry.  Also, the lyrics are quite cheesy and the chorus is just awful.  The guitar solo is good though.

Amazon review: This song was a good reminder of what good guitar sounds like.  Some of the best parts are the guitar solos and the lyrics are very nice.  I still haven't listened to this song in a really long time.  I was reminded of it recently when I was listening to the song "I Don't Want to Be (Last in Line) by The Dixie Chicks.  The song is really good, and it reminded me of the guitar solo on this song.  I love this song.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

"Illuminations" is without question the worst. There is no other artist who I listen to more over time than Mr. Groban. His songs have soothed away many stressful moments and days.
