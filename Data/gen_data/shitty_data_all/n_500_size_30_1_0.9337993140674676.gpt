Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: As an ex-student of music I always had a low opinion of Prince's music. I would call him a genius but his music I always found to be very lacking, and this album is proof to me that Prince could be a hit with the masses if he would just put out another great album!

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for close to 3 months. I have listened to this CD more than any other single album and I consider this a great album.

I can't wait for the new album to come out!

Amazon review: I never knew that such a great artist like Prince had so much talent. I always listened to his music but never really thought that he was a good artist. But, after the album, I started to like his music more. It is not easy to like Prince's music. He was very talented, but I can't say that I enjoyed all of his music. I never had a lot of time to listen to his music. I have listened to almost all his albums and this album is one of my favorites. This album is very good. I will buy it again and again.

Top Ten Best Bonnie Tyler Songs -- 2009

Top Ten Best Bonnie Tyler Songs

The only real Bonnie Tyler song I've heard is "Crying" from the album All Alone & Something to Say.
I'm not a big Bonnie Tyler fan.  I've heard a lot of her songs but they've never really been my cup-of-tea.  I've never really been crazy about her.  I've heard a lot of people say that she is a great singer and I've heard a lot of other people say she's an exceptional singer.
After listening to a lot of her songs I actually started to like some of them.  One of the songs that really stuck in my head is the song "Crying".  After listening to a lot of Bonnie's music I feel like she's a good singer.  She's not some over the top pop star.  She is really good at what she does.  I'm not saying it's not good at what she does.  I'm just saying it's not really my cup-of-tea.

I've heard a lot of people say that she is a great singer and she's an excellent singer.  I've listened to her live a lot.  I've heard a lot of people say she is a great singer and I've heard a lot of other people who say she's an exceptional singer.  I'm not a big Bonnie Tyler fan.  I've listened to a lot of her songs but I've never really been crazy about her.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: The cd is good, but it doesn't feel like REO Speedwagon. I am not a fan of REO Speedwagon's music. It has a hard driving bass line, but it's hard edged. So far, the best thing about this CD is the vocals and the drums. I am not a huge fan of the rock band REO. They are just too loud for me.

###
Amazon review: The first CD I bought in 1980, the cd was a gift from my parents to my brother. I remember being in the living room, sitting on the floor listening to the music. The first cd I bought was "Some Good Years" the second was "Rock On" and then I bought the "Drive" cd a few years later. In the early hours of the morning the second day I drove to work listening to the cd. I heard a loud rock song, and I thought it was a loud rock song, but I soon realized that it was REO Speedwagon. I was surprised to hear a rock song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Some Good Years is my favorite album, and I've been a fan of REO Speedwagon for over 20 years. The only disappointment I have with this album is that it doesn't have the same effect on me, the way "Drive" does. I was surprised how powerful the music really is. I think it would be interesting to compare the two albums musically.

The songs are catchy and fun to listen too, but the sound quality of the CD really makes this CD a waste of time.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: Lyrically, it's not bad, but I am not sure I understand what it's saying.  In the first minute, she sings: "I have no idea why we're talking about the weather I have no idea why we're talking about the weather".  But then she makes it clear.  "We're talking about the weather because it's snowing.  And I've had enough of the weather".  I don't know why she'd come to such a conclusion, any more than I understand why she's going to have plenty of sex when she's married to a man who is not so much interested in sex.  That's not even to mention the fact that he's probably going to die before she does.  I'd have probably given up at that point, the way I felt at the end of the song.  I don't know what she's trying to say to me or anyone else.

Amazon reco...

The song "I Have No Idea Why We're Talking About the Weather" is a decent song, but not my favorite of all time. It is a little long, but the chorus is catchy and the song is very well done.

I have listened to this album only once, and I can say it was likely the best of the albums on the market.

She sings well. In the song, "For the Lonely," she sings "I am not a girl that is lost." That is a very positive message, but it's not that positive in reality. A lonely man is not a man that is lost. A lonely man is a man who is trapped; who is not quitewhere he wants to be.

She's not bad. In the song, "On the Edge," she sings "I am not an old man with a wife who is in love with a man who is a thousand miles away." That is a very positive message, but it's not that positivein reality. A man who is a thousand miles away is not an old man with a wife who is in love with a man. A man who is a thousand miles away is a young man who is lonely, and the song is very good.

I am a bit disappointed but I am willing to give it a chance. The best thing about this album is the music. I have heard it before but it is new to me.

She does well in the song, "For the Lonely" she sings "I am not an old man with a wife who is a thousand miles away." That is a very positive message, and it is not that positive in reality. A man who is a thousand miles away is not an old woman with a

Amazon review: I have loved jazz since I was a little girl. I grew up playing in the local jazz band. I was a little bit younger than most of the guys on the band. I played a couple of different keys and it was fun to pick up the trumpet. Soon after I started playing with my band we started playing at various places like The Cheesecake Factory, The Plaza, etc. I have played on the jazz trio at the Plaza and we have played at a few clubs in the city. I love the music but it's not my favorite. I love more rock. I am happy to see that the music is growing. I love the fact that all of the music is free.

Amazon review: It is a collection of classic rock standards with a few surprises. The music is performed with a powerful sound and amazing vocals. The song selection is great, and this set will not disappoint.

Amazon review: The first CD in this set is the most unusual. It is called "The Music of the Sea". The second CD is entitled "A Journey Through the Sea".

Amazon review: This collection contains the best of two different eras of music in the early 60s. The early music is mostly instrumental and has a very classic feel but is still fresh and exciting. The music of the sea has a different vibe but still features a lot of instrumental pieces and a few songs that have some vocal elements. The vocals are on both CDs, but the vocals on "The Music of the Sea" are not as good as on "A Journey Through the Sea".

We've had the pleasure of meeting Tom Scott at the International Keyboard Festival in Dallas. Tom is a world-renowned, innovative, and inspirational keyboardist. He is a Grammy nominee for two different works and a recipient of the Chicago Tribune's "Keyboard Legend" award.

His career has taken him from a performing career in jazz at Berklee College of Music to a solo piano career as a soloist and also the founder of the award-winning jazz trio Phyllis.

His work on the album "Greensleeves by Tom Scott" was selected by NPR's "Greatest Hits" program as one of the Top 25 Classical Music CDs of the year.

Tom's musical influences include such diverse and influential jazz luminaries as Gerry Mulligan, Art Farmer, Joe Pass, and Mel Lewis along with countless other greats. His compositions have been performed and recorded by the likes of Art Farmer, Ron Carter, and many others.

Tom has been a featured performer at prestigious festivals and venues throughout the U.S. and Europe. He has worked with well-known artists such as Mark Murphy, Gary Bartz, James Moody, and others. He has also been featured on the NPR program "All Things Considered".

In addition, he has been the featured performer on a recording of the Christmas piece "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Mr. Scott has also recorded on a number of albums and compilation projects including "Tom Scott Plays Christmas and Other Works" (for Concord Records) and "Tom Scott Plays Tchaikovsky Piano Works" (for Concord Records).

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

I am sure I will have more great songs added to the album. I'll wait for the reviews to come in.

About the song I had the following comments.

"The song is a very lovely melody and has such a wonderful ending. It has a great feeling of sadness, and I love the fact that it is not repeated after the end.

The song was originally sung by Elvis Presley and is now a hit for other singers.

I remember a song called "It's a Miracle" which was similar in structure to this song, however was much shorter. It is very similar in musical and musical themes.

This is a beautiful song. I love the end of it. It is very sad, but the ending of the song is very happy.

I remember a song called "I Need a Miracle" by The Carpenters. The song is a great example of the use of a guitar and how it can be used to express a very personal feeling.

The Beatles wrote this song and used it in many of their songs. They are most famous for this song.

"I'm a Believer" by Bob Dylan was also a very interesting song for me.

I enjoyed the song, however it did not make the final cut.

"Stand Back" by Marvin Gaye was another song which was interesting. The first half is very slow, followed by a faster part towards the end. It was a great song to listen to.

"I've Got a Thing About You" by The Hollies was very interesting. The song has a lot of energy and is very well put together.

The Beatles wrote this song and it was a huge hit.

"Let It Be" by The Beatles was another great song.

"Goodbye" by Elvis Presley was a very sad song. The only reason I didn't like it was because of the lyrics. However, the song is very good.

"Ferry Cross the Mersey" by The Beatles was actually the best song on the album.

I will be adding more songs to the album soon. I hope you all enjoy!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This album is my favorite album of all time. For the first time in my life I was able to listen to an album of Christian songs with a group of people other than my wife. For the first time I was able to listen to music like it used to be at church when I was a kid. I was able to see that there is a world of music that goes beyond the traditional sound we hear at church. The songs on the album are mostly written by a man named Richard Fariña. The songs are great, but the singer is not a great singer. The lyrics are not great, but the melodies and instrumentation are magnificent. This is a great album.

Amazon review: This is probably the best worship album I have heard. I have seen bands from all over the world, and I have admired all of them. But I have never seen anything like this. It is beautiful, and the lyrics are very well written, and I love the way the songs are sung, by an amazing vocalist, who I have heard singing in church and on the radio.. It is the best worship album I have ever heard, and I know I am not the only one who thinks this way, I am not sure how to describe it, but it is the best worship album I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this for a year and never tire of it.  This is not a "heavy metal" type of album, it has a lot of "jazzy" instrumentals.  And that's fine.

Amazon review: this is a great album.  The vocals are good, the riffs are solid, and the instrumentals are nice.  I just don't like the vocals.  David Lee Roth sucks.

I bought this album because I enjoy listening to country music. I love it. I like the music, the lyrics, and the vocals. The song "We Are Not Alone" is my favorite so far. This album is a good album for country fans to listen to.

I bought this album because I enjoy listening country music. I like the music, the lyrics, and the vocals. The single "We Are Not Alone" is my favorite so far. This album sounds better than some country albums I have heard. The album doesn't have any big name musicians, which is a good thing. I like the different styles of country music and this album has a lot of different styles to choose from.

I usually don't write a review for a country album, but I really like this album. I bought this album because I enjoy listening to country music. I like the music, the lyrics, and the vocals

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: A lot of the reviews seem to be negative.  I am not trying to sound like the last song on an album, but I think it is the first song on the album.  I do not think the song is that bad.  I think it is very good.   I think the song is quite catchy.  The vocals are not bad.  The song is really good.  The only negative thing I can say about the song is that I do not think it can be played on any instrument other than the guitar.   I am not a musician and I do not have an instrument.   But I think if this song was played on a synthesizer or a piano or a cello or an accordion it could be an excellent song.  I am not sure why I am ranting about this song.  I'm really not.  I just wanted to get that out of my system.   I don't like it.  I like him.  I like it.   I like it.  I will buy the album.   I like it.   I like it.   I like it.  I like it.  I like it.

Amazon review: I'm not really into the whole "rock and roll" thing and as far as I'm concerned, there's no such thing as "rock and roll" anyway-except in the sense that you can't get up on stage and sing 'God Bless America' and have it make sense.  I'm more of a folk type of person, so I like some of the more traditional folk and country music-that's how I got my first guitar, and those were the albums that I fell in love with when I was 11 or 12.  But I have a hard time with most folksy folksy country.  So I'm not a big fan of this album.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were just a couple of songs and just a few of the songs on this album.  But then I would be a hypocrite because I LOVE some other "country" songs, which is why this album is so bad.  And I guess that's why it makes a great anti  establishment statement-it's just a bunch of songs that were popular when the album was released and now are not.  I guess they were popular because "they" are mainstream & "we" are not.  I'm glad to hear that the lyrics are not really any good, but I would have given it only 2 stars if it were just the lyrics.

Amazon review: I think all rock music is good.  Rock and roll is just the type of music that I feel most people like to hear and get a little angry about.  I like the heavy metal and metalcore/hardcore type of rock, and I like the heavy metal and grunge type of rock, but for some reason I think most rock music is just too hard and I find the harder music boring.  I'm glad you put this album up (if you don't mind) 'cause it's actually not bad.

Amazon review: I love most of the songs on this album-it's just the lyrics are the reason why I gave it a negative review.  The lyrics are all kind of lame-but I did enjoy the album as a whole.

I don't really have a problem with the songs as a whole, I just don't like the lyrics on the songs.

Reviews for
Wrecked (2001)

5

By R. D. (San Diego, CA)

This album is one that I would love to have had played on my iPod while driving. I've always had this one on my Ipod, but I'm not able to listen to just one song at a time-I've always tried to listen to one track a minute, or at least that's what my friends tell me. I would have loved this album on my iPod while driving, 'cause these songs just get me in the mood to drive fast. I love this song, Wrecked, 'cause it makes me want to be faster, 'cause I just feel like making a mistake is a waste of time. Another favorite is "I wanna drive faster", 'cause you can just feel the speed rush, but you feel that you can drive faster, 'cause you're driving with a good sense of humor. This album made my driving a lot better.

I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Yes, I have to agree with the previous reviewers.  There is a strong resemblance to The Last Waltz, but without the funkiness.  The band is not particularly flashy and the vocals are not particularly good.  It is the type of song you would not think to request as the first song of your wedding reception.  I can't recommend this to anyone.

She has released several great songs on this CD, but I don't really like this one, but I am sure it will be a hit.  I think she did a good job with this one.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).
