Amazon reviewers rating:

4.8/5

"The End of the World" (feat. Sia & Kevin Spacey) is the fourth single from Kevin Spacey's first solo album, "First Love." It's a fairly straightforward love song, but the lyrics certainly leave us with plenty to think about.
"The End of the World" is a song about the end of the world, which of course Kevin Spacey has mentioned is coming, but he also seems to have a more direct message. He sings, "I see the world going down the drain / I see the end of the world coming / I see the end of the world coming," and it's hard not to think about the world's end and think about the end of the world.

"The End of the World" was released in the U.S. on May 22, 2007, and it received a positive response from the public. The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number eighty-two. The song also debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number eighty-one. The song was moderately successful in the U.S., where it became a top ten hit on the Hot 100. The song also won Spacey his first Grammy Award as well as two Grammy Awards.

In addition to the song, "The End of the World" was also included on the soundtrack for the movie "American Gangster."

My thoughts:

"The End of the World" is a fairly generic love song, but it is really touching and sweet. It's not about the end of the world so much as about the end of love. Kevin Spacey sings, "I see the world going down the drain / I see your heart disappearing / I see the end of the world coming / I see the end the world coming," and it's really hard not to get caught up in the world's love and also in the world's end. The lyrics are a bit simplistic and the video does not really show any of the world's end or the end of the world, which is pretty unfortunate. Overall, it's a good song.

"I Need a Girl" is the third single from Kevin Spacey's first solo album, "First Love." The song is a love song that's all about the need to find a girl.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: What a wonderful, soothing and beautiful sound.  It is so soothing that I could listen to it all day long.  I love the way they have used the instruments and voice of the animals to create harmony.  The music is beautiful.  The only thing I dislike is the way they have made the sound quality so horrible.  However the sound quality is not a big factor in my opinion, as I have a good ole record player with a top end sound.  I will definitely be purchasing more CDs from Amazon.  This is the only CD I have listened to in the last 3 days.  I like the way the birds sound.  The only thing is the overall sound quality.  I haven't had many issues with my CD player in a long time, however I do have a problem with the sound quality.  The sound quality of this CD makes me think this CD will be a best seller.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of classical music and the sound of this CD was absolutely fantastic!  The recording sounds clear and well balanced.  The lyrics are great and the music is a wonderful blend of classical and pop.  At the end of the album I am still hearing some of the musical styles of the CD in my head.  I think the CD should be played in the car, in the house, at work or even in bed.  The CD is a must have for any music lover.

Amazon review: This CD provides a lovely, harmonious background to the music.  The CD is beautifully performed by a talented group of musicians.  The sound is clear and well-produced.

I will be using this CD as a musical background on my CD player.  I am thrilled with the sound quality.  This CD is a good representation of the style of music in this CD.  It is an amazing disc.  I am happy with the value.  I will buy another CD from this CD.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I am not a musician, so I have no idea what I am listening to.  I think I am going to have to return this album.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

A:

I'm gonna go ahead and say it, I actually liked it. The songs are a nice mix of hard hitting raps that are a little more laid back than most of the other stuff out there. I'm not sure if I like them better than most of the rap bands out there, but they definitely had their moments. I could never have guessed that ABiCA would be one of my favorites.

A:

In all honesty, the second half of the album has been ruined for me. The songs are very generic and I've been looking forward to this album since it came out. Now, I just feel like I've been lied to. It's like they added a good amount of hip-hop to the second half of the album and then pulled the rug out from underneath me. I thought I was going to

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

I wouldn't call it a "classic" song because it doesn't fit the mold of the "classic" song. Dylan's writing style is a lot different than most of the "classic" type songs that come out these days.  The lyrics make the song work and the music is very uplifting and it sounds just like the song I remember hearing this song being played in a bar or a club.  It isn't perfect but it is a good old-fashioned rock song.

Amazon review: Dylan makes a brilliant comment to the effect that it's often the same folks who are the loudest and most outspoken in their criticism of him that are the last to recognize his genius.  I think he's right about that.  His music is so good that it's easy to forget that he's from a different generation, a different musical culture, and a different musical style than the one he's playing to us.  I haven't spent a lot of time in the last 10 years listening to Dylan because he didn't write any of the songs I've listened to over the last few decades, but this song, along with the other ones that come from this album, are both good examples of his talent.  I don't think I would have listened to this song if it was not the first song I heard from him.  It's not a "classic" song, but it is a good old-fashioned pop song, which is fine with me.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

A:

As a general rule, you can always look at the last few reviews, just to see what people thought about the song. 
If there is a negative review, that means it wasn't liked so much.
If it is a positive review, and there is no negative feedback, then it means it got good reviews. 
So, since it got good reviews, it is probably a good song

A:

When you look at the last few reviews, you'll notice that the majority of them are negative, with just a few positive reviews.
I would also look at the user's rating on Amazon.com.

 If you do a search for this song, you'll get an average rating of 5.7  

 This means that the majority of people that have listened to this song have given it a 5 star rating. 

It also means that it has a lot of negative reviews, but not many positive reviews.

 This means that it has a lot of people that hated the song, but not many who loved it.

 If it gets a high number of negative ratings, it means that it has a lot of people that hated it, but not a lot of people that loved it.

The first thing you have to do is to look at the first few reviews, to see what the first few people have to say about the song. Do they love it? Hate it? Or is it just average at best?

 If they loved it, then it means that this song is definitely worth listening to.
 If they hated it, then it means that this song has a lot of potential for being a good song.
 If it gets average reviews, then it means that it has a lot of potential for being a good song.

 If it gets a low number of reviews, then it means that this song has a lot of potential for being bad.

 If it gets a low number of positive reviews, then it means that it has a lot of people that like it, but not a lot of people that love it.

 If it gets a low number of negative reviews, then it means that it has a lot of potential for being bad.

The second thing you have to do

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There's just something about him that takes me away. he's got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is very different from other music CDs.  The music sounds like a movie on a tv set, not like a CD.  The music is very slow, very depressing, and very hard to listen to.  I don't usually enjoy listening to music that is too slow and depressing.  I have heard from many other music lovers that they really like this music.  I didn't like it then, and I don't like it now.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good CD.  It has good music that you don't hear everyday.  It has good music that is not too loud.  I wish I could give it a better rating.  This CD is good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is not a good album, even for a "singer".  I really do not like her voice, it is not very pleasant to listen to.  Her voice is so high and it sounds like she is singing a little girl's voice.  I am not sure if I would like a singer that sounds like a little girl.  She could do better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album is the one that I had to buy.  I have listened to it several times from the beginning to the end, and I still have no opinion.  It is like a really bad piece of music.  A bad mix of sounds and words.  Even the music is bad.  I am not sure if I would recommend this to anyone.
