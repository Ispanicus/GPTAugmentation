Amazon review: I found this worship CD in a store randomly. It has some of the best praise and worship songs ever. I can't help but get up and praise my God when I hear these songs. What a blessing!

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's unfortunate that there isn't a negative rating scale. The disc took five weeks to arrive. Both the sound quality and the renditions of the songs were abysmal, even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging. Recycled the day it arrived.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Peter Wolf Band since I first heard their self titled debut in the mid-1990s. I thought the music was the best thing I had heard for years. I had hoped that Wolf would follow this up with his third album. I was very surprised to hear that Wolf did not have another album in him. He has a great talent and I hope that he will continue to record and tour.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This band plays music that is absolutely great fun. The band consists of a guitar player, a pianist, and a drummer. The songs are very well thought out, and well sung. The instrumentation is very crisp and the arrangements are very well played. The sound quality is great. The arrangements and the vocals are top notch. The band is excellent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I had no idea that I would really like Peter Wolf until I heard this CD. I have not listened to any of his previous CD's. I found myself drawn to it immediately. I have also listened to the other Peter Wolf releases. He has a great ability to write great songs. I also found that his writing style is a bit more unique than most other vocalists. The songs are very well written. The bass, drums, and keyboards are very well written and arranged. It is a very good CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Peter Wolf is one of the last great vocalists of his generation. He is also one of the few who has the ability to write excellent songs. He has a great ability to sing very well. The only downside is that he is very inconsistent in his voice. If you think this is a good CD you are going to like this CD, but if you are going to buy it, make sure you go into it with your eyes open.

Amazon review: The Peter Wolf Band is a very good band. It is not my favorite CD, but it is very good. I like the CD because the songs are very good. The guitar is very well done.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst CDs I have ever seen. I believe this is the second time he has recorded songs that are so bad they were pulled. The first time was with the "Ave Maria" CD.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.

Amazon review: I like the song "A Woman's Work Is Never Done".  The melody is so simple and the lyrics are so simple I can only assume the singer is a woman.  It's a pretty good song.  My wife would like it.  It's about a woman who can finish a job, and it's about the man who can't finish a job.  The song was written about a woman who was working as a cleaning lady at a hotel.  I don't know if that made sense in the context of the song or not, but it's certainly a song about a woman.

Also, you get to hear his more "straight up" distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly, stylized singing style on many of his recordings (not that there's anything wrong with that!) It's just a refreshing change for his fans.

Amazon review: I love the classic Moonglows recordings.  So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.

Amazon review: For the first time in my life I can say I am really disappointed with a country music album.  I was hoping for something that would keep me going for a few days, but I guess all I got was a couple of days of aggravation trying to get the CD to work.  The first song I fell in love with was "Carry On Wayward Son," which I could not get over.  That is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  I have listened to it over and over again, and I can't get over it.  That is one of the best songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This album is the best thing I have ever heard in my life.  As a teenager I had my first cassette recorder and I would listen to Hank Williams songs.  I thought he was incredible.  After spending time with Hank Williams I realized that I had to get to know other great artists.  I was listening to "A Good Heart" by Hank Williams and that was it for me.  I was hooked and after hearing "I Lived A Little" by Johnny Cash I knew that this was the best album I could have at that age.  I know that I am a country music lover, but I listen to other music too and this was my first time hearing anything like this.  I highly recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best music I have ever heard.  I am a country music fan and I have been listening to this for about a year and a half.  I am a big fan of Hank Williams and I am really happy that I have had the opportunity to hear his music.  I just got this, and I am very excited to listen to this record.  I have never heard anything like this.  This is definitely a "one of a kind" kind of record.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is not a country record, but it is a great country record.  I have been listening to this CD for 2 days straight, and I cannot get enough of it!  The quality is excellent.  The songs are great, and I love all of the different versions of each song.  Hank Williams was a great singer, and this CD is a great tribute to his music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Very few albums in my life have meant more to me than Hank Williams.  I am a country music fan and I am not sure I could have ever imagined that I would have been able to find such a great album to listen to.  I am not sure if it was the music, or the fact that I was in a car accident, but I could not get this album to work.  I was lucky enough to have an older brother who was able to work his magic and make the record work.  What an amazing album.  If you love country music, you owe it to yourself to get this album.  It is a great listen.

Amazon review: I have been a Hank Williams fan for years, and I think this is the best album in my life.  I can't get enough of this album!  I listen to it every day.

If you are a big fan of Hank Williams, you must have this album.  It is a classic album.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Hank Williams, and I love his music.  I can't get enough of this album, and I am really excited to listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.

Amazon review: Not what I was looking for- I wanted a reading of the sanskrit, the word for word definitions and the translation. The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.

Well, I say, "Thanks." I feel like such a loser for not passing. If you are reading this then you are probably reading this as a final attempt to make something of something that you feel is going to end in failure. I know that for a fact. But, you can't fail. There's no way. You can't. If you are reading this then you are in the right place. If you are reading this then you are going to be successful in whatever you choose to do from this point forward. It doesn't matter what you decide to do; you can do it. If you are reading this then you have already passed. I have passed. I am now a senior in college. I have graduated. I have fulfilled my destiny. You can say good-bye to me now. I am not going to be around for very long. But, I am going to leave you with a song.

I'm asking because I have seen a lot of songs and covers that have been done by other artists and I'm wondering if she has done this.

Amazon review: I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album "Babel" after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.

Very strange but a waste of money.

Amazon review:  I listened to the entire album twice and am still not fully convinced.   The songs seem to me very 'frozen in time' and I like that.  I'm not sure that I like that it ends with The House of the Rising Sun and the song 'Hair of the Dog' is probably the best song on the album.  I like that Mumford's lyrics (and sometimes the music) are like a'mashup' of other styles.  I mean it's not like 'Joni Mitchell singing The Weight' or 'The Beatles singing The Weight but it's definitely a style.  I'm not sure if it's a style or a style of a style.  I think that they are just great musicians.   I just wish the songs were longer, they are all so short.

Amazon review:  Just got this album last night and I'm really enjoying it.  I agree with you on the song title.  I guess I'm not a fan of '80s style music.  I like the Beatles I like the Beach Boys, but I don't think I'd like the New Wave style.  I like what the Beatles did best, but I don't think I'd like what they did best.  I think I'm a little more a John Lennon fan than a Beatles fan.  I think I'm a little more a Beach Boys fan than a Beatles fan.  I guess I like the Beach Boys because I'm a fan of the Beach Boys.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: I am constantly amazed that today's musical groups have such little imagination that they have to cop the names of yesteryear's bands who have already earned their niches in the music world's history.. and that they do it so very badly. Bands like the People, Touch, White Witch, Armageddon,(and the list goes on and on)were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds. And yet, modern bands continue to take those names for themseles, then release inferior, common, boring music, and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the names of others.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has no talent.  They are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible.  If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.

This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.

Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

This is the same song, "Where My Heart Will Take Me", that was used as the theme for Enterprise but this version from the "Encore" CD is not the same arrangement and the differences are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the "Enterprise" TV series.

If I'm listening to music on my iPad I won't be able to listen to this song without switching to the Amazon app. That would b a pain.

Amazon review: This CD contains the censored version.  When Cash says "the son of bitch" you'll hear BEEEEEP instead. What are we, 10 years old?  The 'At San Quentin' original version is uncensored. I'm not sure what other versions are uncensored, but definitely this one is.  When this song is not censored, it is a 5-star song that puts a smile on your face.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

###
Amazon review: I had a hard time deciding what this song was about, because so many of the lyrics are just so open ended. As I listened to this song, I decided that it was about the end of a relationship. The song is not easy to listen to, but is incredibly catchy and fun to listen to.

Amazon review: I love this song, and this is the version I would most often listen to; however, I think that the instrumental music is a little too much. I'd recommend either the version with the vocals or the version without the vocals - that way you can focus on the music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are so many great versions of this song, but the version I most often heard was by the Beatles. The Beatles version is one of my favorite songs. The instrumentation is very different than the Stones version, but I like the Beatles version better because it feels more like a song rather than just a ballad. The vocals are very different as well. They're a little more nasal than they are on the Stones version. But, that's the version I like best.
