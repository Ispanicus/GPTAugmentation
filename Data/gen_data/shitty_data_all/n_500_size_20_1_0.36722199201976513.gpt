Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This album is a great album and it's definitely worth a listen. I am

1. I can't believe it took me this long to listen to it. I bought this album when it was first released, and I'm still finding new and old gems to listen to on a regular basis. I've been a fan of Deftones for probably 15 years, maybe more, and even though I haven't been as into the band as I once was, I still continue to get into the music of this band.

2. I think this album is on par with some of their better works. This is my first Deftones album that I've really enjoyed, and this is the only album I have ever listened to that I'm actually happy I bought. The vocals are a little too harsh on the album, while the guitar sound is perfectly on point. The music fits the album perfectly, and the songs are all different in style. The album is overall good, but I can't say I'm all that crazy about the album as a whole.

3. The vocals on the album are great. I love when Deftones have a female lead vocalist on the album and I particularly love the vocals in this album. The vocals on this album are very clear and easy to listen to, and they all fit together perfectly. The vocals on the album are great, but the overall track selection is horrible. I know this is a CD and not a mix or a DJ mix, but I have heard far too many songs on this CD to be upset about it. The album has a few songs that are great songs, but far too many songs to be considered great. I think the overall quality of the songs on this album is average at best, but I still feel this album is worth a listen.

4. I'm a huge Deftones fan, but I don't know if I'd buy this album just because of the vocals. The guitar sound is fine, but the vocals on this album are pretty bad. The vocals are the only thing that I dislike about this album. The other songs on the album are really good, but the vocals on the album are pretty bad.

5. I think this album is probably my favorite album of the band's. This album is a great album and I highly recommend it. At the end of the day, this is a great album that you have to own.

6. I thought the overall quality of this album was really good. The music is great and the vocals are great. The songs are all different and they all fit together perfectly. The album is very catchy and the songs are unique. The album is definitely worth a listen, but I don't know if it's worth having on vinyl.

7. I think this album is pretty good. I'm really impressed by this album and it's not really what I would consider a bad album by any means. I think this album is a good one, but its nothing special.

8. I'm a big fan of Deftones, and I think this album is definitely worth a listen. I think this is a good album, but not a great one.

9. I have listened to this album probably 10 times already. I bought this album because I thought it would be a nice alternative to the band's usual stuff. I got it for my brother, and I really think he would enjoy this album. This album is a good one, but it's not really a bad one.

10. I think this album is pretty good. I

Amazon review: Great song.  I think it sounds like a good Southern Gospel song to me, but I've never heard it in the context of a church service.  I do enjoy the melody and the use of the minor triad in the melody. I also think the backing vocals are excellent.  I don't like the vocal style of the singer.  The song begins with an acoustic guitar and then the piano enters with a very high octave melody.  I prefer to hear the piano melody because it seems more original to me.  I also like the use of the major triad in the melody.  The acoustic guitar in the chorus is also very good.  There is a slight repetition of the "somewhere" in the second verse, however, I think it may be the acoustic guitar again.  The chorus is really strong and the lyrics are very good.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I bought this because I thought it would be nice to hear the song "I Can't Make It" on the radio.  I got a CD as a gift from a friend, so it was the only CD I had.  I liked it, and I bought the first single, "I'm Just A Boy", and when I put it in, I was pleased.  After the song ended, it said "Next track" and then it started playing "I Can't Make It".  I thought it was the next song, but then it stopped playing I Can't Make It, and started playing it again.  I thought, how can that be the next song, after the song I just played?  I never got to hear the rest of the album, but I feel like I should have, because I really enjoyed listening to it.  I just wish they would have put the song first, so I could have listened to it, without buying it, instead of having to buy it.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Tim McGraw.  I have listened to every song on every Tim McGraw CD ever released.  I have listened to every single album, including the Christmas album, and I have listened to every song on every single album, from every era of Tim McGraw's career.  I have listened to every song on every Tim McGraw CD, and every song on every Tim McGraw CD ever released.  I have never heard anything on any of these albums that I have loved so much, it makes me want to cry.  I am still listening to Tim McGraw!  I will be playing "Ain't Not Gonna Let You" to my friends and family this holiday season.  I am very very very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a huge Tim McGraw fan.  I own all of his CDs.  I'm not a fan of his music, but he is the greatest singer who ever lived.  I will probably buy another Tim McGraw album, but not this one.  I'm not disappointed, I'm just not.  The song "Heaven" is not great, but I don't listen to Tim McGraw, so it is hard to hear any of his songs (except for the songs on his Christmas albums).  I just can't believe this album is bad.  I had to buy it to be able to say I am disappointed.  Tim McGraw is the greatest singer who ever lived.  I will buy another Tim McGraw CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Tim McGraw since I first heard his rendition of "The Rose" on "I Wish I Could Change My Mind".  It has been my favorite Tim McGraw song ever since.  I had thought this would be his best album, because of the huge guest stars, but I was wrong.  It is his worst album ever.  I am disappointed in Tim McGraw.  I am hoping he finds another career.  I hope he does not try to sing again, or he will be terrible.  He is an amazing performer, but he is a horrible singer.  Tim McGraw is the greatest, but he is the worst.  I don't think he deserves another album.  I hope he does something else, like play a part in the movie "Clueless".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had to buy this song "Dedication" on CD, because I had a friend who is a huge Tim McGraw fan.  I could not resist it being on CD.  I bought it, and then I could not listen to it.  I listened to it on my iPod, and I just could not listen to it.  I was disappointed.  I had to buy it, because I wanted to listen to it.  The song is beautiful, and it has a great message, but I feel like he should have put it on the radio, instead of putting it on CD.  I think he should have put this song on his Christmas album, and then released it a few weeks after the holidays.  If he would have done that, it would have been amazing.  I don't think anyone should ever buy this CD.  I hope he finds another career.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is a very talented musician.  This is his second single from his new album "Ain't No Sunshine".  It's a good song.  He doesn't sing it as well as in his previous song but it's still really good.  The lyrics are a little repetitive, but I still like it.  It's not a high quality song, but it's still a good song.  2 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is a very good musician.  This is his second single from his new album "Aint No Sunshine".  It's a good song.  He doesn't sound like he's singing it, but he's still pretty good.  The lyric is repetitive, but he says a lot of good stuff.  The song doesn't really move, but it does have good key changes and the melody is nice.  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I don't know what other reviewer said, but for me, this song is not a song, but a "piano masterpice."  I'm looking for the next piano masterpice from Lenny.  It's not that he is bad, but he has a very limited range.  He does a great job playing the "guitar" of the song.  I guess I wasn't paying attention to the vocal.  He could have performed the entire song by himself.  I just wasn't listening carefully.  I would recommend him again for sure.  I'm not sure he'll be remembered as an artist, though.  He's more of a studio musician.  So, it's not like he should be remembered as an artist.  I don't think it's a "hit;" it just might be a good song.  1 star.

Amazon review: This is a really good song, if you like the sound of it.  There is a lot of variety in the sound.  In fact, there are more than a few instruments that I'm not familiar with.

I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of your musical taste; it will not disappoint.  2 stars.

Amazon buyer review: This is a really good song, if you like the sound.  There is a lot of variety in the sound.  In the background, I hear a lot of piano playing, the piano being an instrument I'm not totally familiar with.  I loved the lyrics, and I loved the melody, but the piano playing took me out of the song.  I'd recommend this to anyone.  I was surprised that I liked it.  I thought it was just a boring song.  I'm a little weird; I like "our song" because it is a song, but I don't like it because it is not a song.  I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of your musical taste.  I like it very much.  2 stars.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

This is a really good record, but I would've like it if there were more songs and more variety.  I really like this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Bronn Journey's music is amazing, but I don't understand why they're not touring.  They're the best punk band out there, and they're probably the only punk band to have a good songwriter.  They don't tour though.  They never play live in my opinion, which I think is sad.  I really like the way the songs are written and the way they sound.  I think their music is amazing, but they need to get out and make a living.  There are a lot of great bands out there that need to get out and make money.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a stupid, stupid, stupid album.  I don't like Timbo.  I don't like him.  I don't even like his music.  Listen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6gT5pVQtWk&t=2s
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So, I have to admit that I'm a Timbo fan and I don't know what his agenda is.  You can tell it's his agenda when you listen to it or even watch him on youtube, he's just trying to make a scene and trying to be like Snoop Dogg.  He's not a hip hop artist.  As someone who's listened to hip hop and rap music for many years and has been writing about the music industry for years in a number of blogs, his music is not hip hop, it's pop.  The music is not even that good.  It's awful.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So, I am a Timbo fan and I have to admit that I don't really know who he is.  He is a rapper who made a video with Wiz Khalifa and I don't really like rapper because he's not hip hop.  The only reason I was listening to him was because it was from him and he's a rapper and I'm a fan of that.  The music is so bad I don't even know why I have it.  I don't even know who the guy is.  I don't even know who the artist is.  I don't know how it even happened.  I don't even know what the album is about.  The album is bad and I don't even know why I have it.  He doesn't even have any real songs except for the "I got a new found love, I'ma get a new found love" on his song "Timbo".  I don't even know what it means.  I don't even know who the album is from, I don't know what it's about.  I don't know nothing.  I don't even know why I have it. I don't even like it.  I don't even like it.  I don't know why I have it.  I don't know what it's about.  I don't even know who the artist is.  I'm going to start a petition to turn the album off.  I want to get rid of it.  I don't give a shit.  I don't know why I have it.  I don"t know nothing.  I don't know who it's by.  I don't even know why I have it.  I don't know who the artist is.  I hate it.  I don't care who he is.  I don't even know what it's about.  I don't even know who the album is from.  I don't know who the artist is.  I don't know anything.  I don't like it.  I don't know why I have it.  It's not worth the time it takes to listen to it.  I don't know why I have it.  I hate it.  It's awful.  If I had the money I would just turn the album off or I wouldn't have it.  I wouldn't listen to it.  I won't listen to it.  It's a waste of my time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album because I heard on the radio that Timbo was on it and I wanted to see what Timbo would sound like.  I just can't stand his music.  I tried to listen to it but it's just so bad.  I didn't even know who Timbo was.  I was more interested in hearing what he was talking about.  I'm not a fan of hip hop and rap music.  I don't listen to any rap music.  I don't even listen to hip hop.  I just know it and I like it.  I just don't like it.  I don't even know why I have it.  I hate it.  It's a waste of my time.  I didn't even know you could buy an album for only $1.29.  I don't care who Timbo is.  I didn't even know it was out.  It's not worth the time it takes to listen to it, I don't know why I have it.  I hate it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a fan of this artist just because he sings.  I know that he says some good lyrics, but I still don't like his music.
