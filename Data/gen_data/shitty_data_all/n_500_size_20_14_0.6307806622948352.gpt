Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I've heard this song at least a hundred times. I have about 6-7 CD's that I've bought from this artist. This song has always been one of my favorites. I just can't get enough of it. It is soooo good. I wish I could put it on my Christmas CD. But I'm not allowed to because its overplayed.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I don't think this is the best version, but it is the best I have heard.  It sounds tight and the lyrics flow naturally.  I thought the vocals were great as well. I would have liked to hear them sung in a more "rock" style, but the guitar work was awesome.  I would have liked to see the band take a more "classical" approach to the song.  My favorite is the original version, but my favorite version is the one from the movie.  I've heard it on the radio and was amazed.

Amazon review: The only difference is that I'd have liked to hear the band take a more rock-based approach to the song.  The lead singer is amazing, but I wish he would have taken a few more chances with his voice.  I'd have liked to hear more harmony vocals in the background as well.  The guitar work was solid, but I thought the vocals were the best part of the song.  The drumming was solid as well.  I thought the production was fine except that the guitar part was a little too high pitched (at about 1:10).

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.

In fact, I would say that this is the worst Lady Gaga album that I've heard so far.  The quality level is not good enough, so I don't recommend it.  The cover art is terrible, the songs are boring, and the production quality is not good enough to make this worthy of buy or at least add to your library.

"Lady Gaga has created an album that is not only beautiful, but is also filled with interesting songs that she has created herself, and that is why I think this album is so wonderful.  There are a lot of strong songs on here, but the best part is that she has created a new style of music.  This album is not the same as her previous works, and I think that's why it is so great."  -  J.D

Amazon review: If Lady Gaga's music is about expressing emotions, then this album is about expressing anger.  Her anger is a good thing, because it's an important thing to have, and it's a bad thing to try to control others' feelings.  But, on the other hand, it's also a really good thing to express anger, because anger is a good thing.

Lady Gaga fans from around the world, listen to this one!  This will be the first album that Lady Gaga has released since the release of ARTPOP.  And, it is a pretty good album, because it sounds like a good album.  There is nothing really outstanding on this album, but it's not that bad, and it can't be called a bad album, because there are a few songs that are really good.  There are three songs that are really good, and you can hear them here.  The song "Poker Face" is an old standard, and it's always a pleasure to hear her sing.  And the third song is an old standard, and it's a very good one, too.  It's the third song on the album, "Poker Face," and it's a very good song.  "Poker Face" is really good, and it's a good song, but it's not that great of a song.  The song is good, but it's not a great song.  And, "Poker Face" is not very good, because this song is kind of boring.  The song is not bad, but it's not that great of a song.  The song has a catchy beat and it has a good melody, although it's not a very good melody.  But, it's not that bad...

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: I had to replace a CD I had lost.  This is the second time that I have had this problem.  When I used to order my songs at the top of the hour I used to always receive them.  Now I don't and no one seems to be able to help me.  I have been with this company for over 15 years, and have never had a problem.  I have been a paying customer since the beginning.  I am not the only one.  I have been sent to the point where I have lost hope.  The customer service is the worst I have ever seen.  They give me a phone number and leave it.  I call and speak to someone and they tell me they are no longer answering the phone.  I call them back and leave a message.  I have called in 15 minutes and spoken to 7 people who promised to get back to me within the hour.  They never do.  I call back and leave a message on the phone, and again they never get back to me.  I have been told they are going to be closed for the day.  I call back and leave a message.  They say they are closed for the day.  I call back.  I speak to a man who promises to call me back as soon as he gets off the phone.  I wait for 15 minutes and he doesn't call back.  I call back.  I speak to an assistant at this place.  She promises to call me back.  I wait for 30 minutes and she doesn't get back to me.  Then I call the customer service.  They tell me to send in the CD and they send me out the CD and the case.  They say they will call me back about the CD and the case.  I call back and speak to a man who promises me that they will call me back.  He tells me to send them the information.  I talk to the lady and she says "I don't know what you are talking about."  I ask her if she is going to call me back and she says "No, I am going to look into it.  I will call you back."  I talk to her and she says "I don't know what you are talking about, I will call you back."  I told her again she would call me back.  She says I am a liar.  I told her I was a very busy person and that I would call her back.  She says "I am sorry I can't help you today."  She hangs up on me.  The reason I lost my CD was because I had misplaced it and had just placed another order.  I have had this problem for months, and I have had it for almost 3 years.  I don't know what to do, I have been told the customer service is the worst I have ever seen.  I have sent them a couple email asking them to help me, but I don't know what they are doing.  I do know I do not want to lose my money.  I have sent a couple emails and they said they are going to send me out the CD and the case.  I have not heard from them since.  I know it is something with the internet and email, but I don't know what.  I have read the reviews on the internet and I see that some of them have had problems, but I don't know how I have been treated.  I am just a man who loves to write songs and buy songs.  I don't have time to sit and wait for help, or to wait for a phone call.  I don't want to be treated like this and I want my money back.  I want my songs back.  I think that this company is just trying to get rid of people that have been with them for a long time.  I have had this problem for months and I am still waiting for my money back.  I have lost hope.

Amazon review: I ordered a CD from Amazon and they sent the CD and a case in a couple days.  I did not get a CD.  I called and was told that the only way to get my CD back was to pay a fee of $1.65 to get the CD back, plus $1.50 shipping to my home...which I paid for, and they were unable to get the CD back.  I was even told that I would have to pay another $1.50 shipping and handling fee to get the case back...which I did not pay for and they were unable to get the case back.  I'm very upset with them and do not recommend them to anyone.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: The title track from the album "You've Done It All" really has an amazing beat.  I had a hard time with the lyrics of this song.  The title is a nice touch and tells a story.

I don't know how you can describe this song as something negative.  It is so good, and it's totally worth buying, even if you don't listen to the band.  I love that they were an independent band and didn't make huge tours or record a big hit.  They wrote a lot of their own songs, and they didn't care about whether they sold more records.  Their songs are great.  If you listen to this album, you'll be happy with it.  I hope you do!

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I have just recently come across this CD and I thought it was a good album, but I wasn't too impressed. I am disappointed that there is no new material from the great band, I was hoping for more of their tunes to come out in the future.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Brian, you have no idea how frustrating this all is.  The song "My Life" is amazing.  And of course I love the song "I'm the Man."  I'm glad you love it and I'm glad you love the album.  But I really don't understand how it could be a great album and a terrible one at the same time.  I really don't!  It is a lot of fun when you listen to the album as you would listen to a regular record.  But it's just not the same.  If you want to really listen to the album you have to put it on shuffle.  It is still a great album.  But the songs are not as great as when you listen to them as you would listen to a regular album.  You are very wrong if you think this is a good album and a bad album at the same time.  I am sure you would love this album as much as I do.  But it's not, Brian.  It's a great album in its own right, but it's just not the same as when I was listening to it as I would listen to a regular album.  That is the problem.  Let me explain it to you.  This is the album that I always wanted to hear when Brian told me about it.  He said he got it off the CD he bought for my birthday.  I was so excited.  Then he gave it to me and I said "I have to listen to it on my own.  I don't want to listen to this as you listen to a regular album."  Then he gave it to me and I said "I have to really listen to it on my own, Brian!  Don't leave me alone with this music."  So I bought the album and listened to it on my own and I felt so let down.  I really didn't like it.  I had to do it.  I listened to it on the car ride home and I was so upset.  It just did not work for me.  It just didn't.  It was not the same.

Amazon review: I think Brian is overreacting.  The song "My Life" is an amazing song and it is a great album.  I love the song "I'm the Man."  I am glad you love this and I am glad you love the album.  But I really don't understand how this album could be a great album and a terrible album at the same time.  I really don't!  It is that good.  I don't know how you could think this is a good album and a bad album at the same time

Amazon review: Brian, you are overreacting.  The song "My Life" is an amazing and a great album.  I love the song "I'm the Man" and I am glad you love this and the album.  But I really don't understand how this album could possibly be a great album and a terrible album at the same time.  It is that good.  I don't know how you could possibly think this is a good album and a bad album at the same time  It is that good.  I don't know how you could consider this a good album and a terrible album at the same time.  It is that really good.  I don't know how you cannot consider this a good album and a terrible album at the same time.

Amazon review: I love this album. It is a great album.  I love the song "I'm the man."  I love the song "My Life" and I am glad you love the album and I am glad you love the song.  But I really don't understand how this album can be a great album and a terrible album at the same time.  The song "My Life" is amazing.  I love the song "I'm the Man" and I love the song "I'm the Man."  I am glad there is a song called "I'm the Man."  I am glad there is a song like "I'm the man" that the song makes you want to listen to again and again.  That is how it is with this album.  Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is great, and sometimes it is terrible.  Sometimes the song "My Life" is great, and sometimes the song "I'm the Man" is great, and sometimes the song "I'm the Man" makes you want to listen to it over and over again.  That is how it is with this album.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.
