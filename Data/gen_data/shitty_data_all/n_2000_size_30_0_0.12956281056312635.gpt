Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all. The singers aren't louder than the accompaniment, so what is the point of a song if you can't hear or understand the words, especially in a Christmas carol.  There is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty.

Amazon review: This review is about the quality of the vinyl, not the quality of the music. My copy of this album skipped several times, most notably on the song "Decks Dark". Always in the exact same spots. As this is unacceptable, I had to send it back.

Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

Amazon review: Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this was a free download when you install the amazon software. I was trying to figure out why I had purchased this since I have no recollection of doing so, or ever heard of the artist.  Very generic song, no redeeming qualities for me.  Sounds like just about everything else out there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very disappointed by this CD which I will probably listen to only once.  Elling's interpretations of most of these terrific songs just grate, and his voice is nothing special.  His butchering of "On Broadway" is particularly heinous.  I'd have given the CD one star except for the really lovely version of Paul Simon's "American Tune".  A waste of money.

Amazon review:  This is an enjoyable album!  If you like traditional bluegrass music it is here for you!  I like that there are no "boutique" artists on this album, as there is so much more variety on other albums.  This album has a very traditional sound, as well as a very modern sound.  The main reason this album is so good is because of the excellent writing and the beautiful arrangements that add to the music.  If you don't like traditional bluegrass, then this album may not be for you.  All in all, this is a good album for any bluegrass fan.

Amazon review:  This album is definitely worth buying.  I have listened to this album many times and it is always worth adding to your collection.

Amazon review:  This album does not disappoint.  It is not a bad album in any way.  While it has a few songs that may not be bluegrass by themselves, the songs on here are all good, and the album itself is a good experience!  The songs are short and have good lyrics.  The album has a lot of variety, and I personally think the songs on this album are better than those of most other bluegrass albums.  The only negative of this album is that some of the songs are a little harder than the others, but I still think most of the songs are good.

Amazon review: Since I grew up in an extremely remote part of Alaska, I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't very exposed to the Bee Gees' music in the Seventies. I was only familiar with "Lonely Nights" from a mix album of my parents and I had no idea who the artists were. In my twenties I ventured out into the world and heard "Stayin' Alive" and other disco hits without really paying much attention. In my thirties I had dinner at my parents' house and afterwards they watched an A&E special concert promoting the Bee Gees album, "This is Where I Came In.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: There are many releases of "The World of Nat King Cole" (others with 27 to 52 songs) which importantly include the brilliantly done "Unforgettable" duet where Natalie sings along with his original version.  This is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollars, you are better off skipping this one for one of the others.

Amazon review:  I really liked this album when it first came out.  There were a lot of really good albums in the 80's and this was one that I liked.  I thought it was really good and that it was the best of the genre.  I liked the sound of it, the songs were great and I really enjoyed the album.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It reminds me of the music I heard when I was a kid and when I first started listening to disco.  There are a lot of great songs on this album (but "Just a Little Help" is my number one).  "The World of Nat King Cole" is a good album, but it's kind of strange because it's a medley of the songs that he sang on in the 1960's.  I also think that he should have done a medley of the songs he sang in the 90's.  But it's a good album nonetheless.

Amazon review:  I have not heard this CD before but I really like it!  I thought the music was good but the lyrics were all over the place.  It was a good listen but it's kind of hard to listen to all of the songs especially when you get to the end.  But the songs that you get to hear are all really good, I really love "Don't Give Up on Us Baby" and "Stayin' Alive".

There are a lot of really good songs on this CD!  I like all of the songs on this album!  I had a hard time figuring out what songs were on this CD because the song titles were all different.  I'm really enjoying this CD because of the songs I have heard so far, the music is good and the vocals are great!  The only tracks I don't like on this CD are "Don't Give Up on Us Baby" and "Stayin' Alive".  But it's still worth buying.

Amazon review: His commentary around the song on this version of Live at Massey Hall was sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch. I'd seen a Youtube clip of him at Massey Hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he'd written the song for him. It was kind, and touching, and the song itself was great. Look for another year at Massey Hall, I am!

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!

Amazon review:  This is the same album without the name change.  I really couldn't stand it when they played it as Hellbilly.  They should have stuck with the original name.  I thought Sinister Urge was great but this is a very short album, too short to make any impression.

Amazon review:  I'm a big fan of Tegan and Sara - they make me feel happy.  I was surprised to find that this is not their best album - I thought it would be more of a return to sound and style they were known for.  But it is not - this album is just ok.  I don't know if it's just their new producer or if there was a lot of other things going on behind the scenes.  It just doesn't seem like a return to the sound they were known for.  I can't say I like this album at all -  it's not bad, mind you, but I don't think it's their best.  They are probably better by this album - probably because they are more comfortable in their own skin and have learned to make a lot of personal decisions.  I'm not sure what was going on in the studio, but I like their new direction and I'm glad Tegan and Sara are back.

Amazon review:  I bought my first Tegan and Sara album on the recommendation of my friend (who I listened to a lot of their music when she was alive).  I knew there would be some songs I would like, but I never expected to love them (especially after I heard their "The Party's Over" album).  I was completely blown away by this album.  Tegan and Sara are one of my favorite bands and this is why.  I love how they are so different from each other, yet so similar.  It makes it easy to enjoy their music because each song is unique and has a great message.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Tegan and Sara or indie music in general.  I also think the new songs on this album are a good change-up from the old ones.  I will definitely buy the other albums as soon as they are released.

I love it and I think it is a very important song for them to be sharing because it addresses a sensitive subject.  They are good singers.  I am going to buy the other Tegan and Sara albums, but this one will stay on the shelf for a while.  I am so glad I got it.  I have been a fan of Tegan and Sara for a very long time.  There are a lot of great songs on this album and I think that it is very well written.

Amazon review: After listening to the previews on Amazon I decided to buy the actual CD. I've always liked DJ Shadow, and was interested to hear what kind of beats he was making now (in 2016).  It is typical Shadow ambiances and found sounds, but some tracks have wildly swung broken beat patterns like Flying Lotus and the like. A few tracks attempt a dubstep feel, but it comes across as plodding. A couple selections even have some trap high hat patterns and tripleted patterns.

Amazon review: I love this record. I've been looking for a long time for a new DJ Shadow album. It's so refreshing to hear him break out from the trap/bass heavy rap/house music he does.

This is a great album.

I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.

Amazon review: No banjo. I was simply disappointed by the overall sound. I loved Mumford's first album, and thought the second one was just as good if not better. I was very excited to receive this CD the first day it came out, but after listening to it three times end to end, I felt bored. After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it. I hold out hope that the group makes a 4th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original two CDs so terrific.

Amazon review: Have you ever felt like your day was dragging? Those days when you're upset for no reason at all? How about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you're just not feeling the appropriate motivation.  I have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above afflictions is listen to "Eye Of The Tiger". This song will cure any mental ailment. They you should have it pumping through the streets of Alaska during the dark parts of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review:  I have a song I'm trying to put out there.  It's a great tune, but it's not a song I'd put in my car - at least not the kind of car I'd be driving. The kind of car I could barely afford to drive without falling into debt. The tune is called "You Are My Sunshine" and is written by Randy Newman. The opening words are not the most inspiring - I would have to say, "I feel like a king today/I'm so glad it's you." This song has been a personal favorite of mine for a long time - I remember when I was in college, I had a boyfriend who loved it as much as I did. The only problem is, I don't remember him doing it. In fact, he was a jerk. I still love that song, though, and I'm glad that I still have it.  I hope this post finds you, and that you are enjoying this release.

Amazon review: While I'm on a roll with the new releases, I wanted to go back to one of my favorite albums from the early 90's.  "The Sound Of Music" is a great movie and this is a great album, but I've never been a big fan of Liza Minnelli.  If you've heard my review of the album, you know that I was a huge fan of the movie.  She's just not for me.  The songs from this album are great, but I just cannot get into the album. It's too "Mildred Pierce" for me. I think if you're a fan of this movie, or if you're looking for something new to listen to, you'll probably enjoy this album. I hope you enjoy it.

Amazon review: I'm not the biggest fan of the song "One Night In Bangkok" by Sia.  I do like the rest of the album and this song just has no soul to it. I can't really explain what I mean by soul, but in a nutshell, it's an upbeat tempo song about having a good time in Bangkok. I love the song and the album, but I just can't get into it.  While I'm not a huge fan, I know there are few people that would disagree with me. For the record, I've listened to the whole album many times over the years.  I just can't get into the song.  This is a great album for anyone who loves the sound of a good pop song.  If you're not a fan, you won't enjoy it either.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of this song by The Ramones called "My Girlfriend's Boyfriend", then I can't help you.  The song's great, and the video is cool and all, but I just can't get into it.  I'm not a huge fan of the song and I actually think I prefer the song "My Girlfriend's Boyfriend" instead.  I don't love the video though.  It's good to see that people love the song, but I don't think I could go through the same experiences.  I'll probably never have a "girlfriend" - I'd be too afraid that she would leave me. The song's pretty cool otherwise, but this reviewer is just wrong.

Amazon review:  I am a fan of The Beatles and "I Want To Hold Your Hand".  I love the song.  I've listened to it many times over the years.  It's just one of those songs that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  That being said, I've always been a fan of the Beatles and I'm proud to have discovered this song.  I'm not a big fan of the song, but I will listen to it over and over again.  I think the song has real meaning behind it.  I have listened to the album many times over the years.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I did not like this CD.  I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

This CD is not bad, but to be honest it is not really for me.  I will probably listen to it again in a few months when the CD is no longer available, but maybe I'll just wait for the new re-release for the DVD version, which I am hoping will have the songs remastered.  I will also look into purchasing the CD's in different quality formats.  I appreciate the review, and thank you for taking the time to write it.  Have a great day!

Amazon review: I love the classic Moonglows recordings.  So I was delighted to see that I could purchase them on Amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl.  oops - I downloaded "I Was Wrong" and it was COMPLETELY NOT THE ORIGINAL DOO WOP VERSION of the song.  This version has a strong background track, it is highly produced, it is just off.  This is just my taste, but the new version of the tune was awful and not what I was looking for at all.  Anyone interested in classic Moonglows tracks should BEWARE before buying these.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I know a lot of people enjoy "I Was Wrong" I did too back in the day, but I don't really remember it being a huge hit with most listeners.  The more I listen to this song the more I think the original is the best.  I think you can only really hear the full power of the original if you are familiar with its structure.  If you are familiar with the original, this is a great song to listen to.

Amazon review: I was actually very surprised that there was no vocals on this song.  I thought it was a great and catchy song.  It just didn't come across as a hit.  So I rated it 2.5 stars.  It's a catchy song, but it doesn't have a lot of impact with the average listener.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is pretty much the only decent song on the album.  "I Was Wrong" is a great song.  There are a lot of mediocre songs on this album.  "Take Me Out" is a good song, but it is also a song that is almost completely ignored.  "I Wanna Go Home" is an average song, but only because of the average quality of the recording.  "I Was Wrong" is the only decent song on this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First off, I can't stand "I Was Wrong" because of the horrible sound quality.  Next, I don't think this is a very good album.  I think every song on it is a let down.  The only songs that I actually liked were "I Feel Alright" and "I Was Wrong".  I don't understand how the rest can't be enjoyed by someone.  I just don't get it.  I like the song "I Was Wrong" quite a bit.  I am actually not sure if I like this album more than the original "Moonglow".  I would say that the album is almost as bad as the original "Moonglow".  The original had a lot more songs and some of them were really good.  I don't know why the band included "I Was Wrong" in the first place.  It has a really nice beat and it has a great chorus.  It's just a mediocre song.  "I Feel Alright" is just a really good song.  I don't think that it's the best song on the album.  "I Was Wrong" is a good song, but it is certainly not the best song on the album.  It is just a really nice song.

Amazon review: This song was supposed to be a good number one hit.  So I was very happy to find this song in the top 10.  This is a good song.  The song has a great beat.  It has a catchy chorus.

It's got a good beat, it's got some good instrumentation, and it has a really catchy chorus.  This song could be a good song, but it's not.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: A lot of people have praised this disc - but I'm not one of them.  This recording is many things, but the SOUNDTRACK it is NOT!  Despicable Me has a very good film score composed by Pharrell Williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him.  This disc has the songs that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score!  Despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film's background music.

Amazon review: This is one of the best rock albums ever produced.  It is not what you would call "rock", but its definitely a rock album.  You can't help but get into their music.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.

Amazon review: As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.

Amazon review: The most popular guy in the world, I guess.  I know there are several singers similar to him, but he has a very distinct sound.  You can tell he was a great singer.  But, this album is just so bland and uninspired.  I would rather listen to Prince's Lovesexy than this.  I can't really understand why people like this singer.  I mean, he is not even half the singer Prince was.  This is a joke.  I could not wait for the DVD and the DVD was a waste of time.  I wish Sony would have just released this as a single CD.  I would have bought it and left it alone.
