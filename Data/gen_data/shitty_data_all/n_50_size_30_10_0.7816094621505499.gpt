Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song was my first introduction to Mumford & Sons. When I first heard the first two albums I felt like I'd just stumbled onto something truly amazing. In my early teens, I was deeply troubled and needed to hear this music. A few years later I was married, and I was finally able to listen without fear of hearing about the wife-beating and domestic abuse that I'd experienced. This is a great song, with a wonderful, unique blend of acoustic guitar, mandolin, and vocals. I'm not sure what I love most about the song. The words are just so powerful, and I feel as if they are speaking directly to me. I love the simplicity of the lyrics, and the emotion of the music. When I first heard this song I immediately thought of my wife, who's name is Sarah. I love her so much, and I think this song is speaking to her in the same way.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are powerful and the music is very soothing. The narrator is not only encouraging you, but also encouraging you to think about your life and your relationship with God. This was an uplifting song that I had been looking forward to listening to for quite some time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is not only good, but is a very good song. The chorus is very catchy, and the guitar and voice are both very good. The words really make you think about the life that you are living now, and the life that you are hoping for to come. The guitar is very good, and the vocals are ok but not great. The song makes you realize that you need to be doing something to make your life better, not just sit around and think about the past. The only slight negative is the fact that it feels as if the song is just a bit too long, but the chorus is very good. Overall this is a good song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song was my favorite on the album. I love it because it is very easy to listen to and has a very nice guitar chord progression. The song is not only a positive song, but it also is very upbeat and uplifting. I really like how the song is simple, yet very effective. I love the use of the simple and familiar words, like "I've got a plan" and "I need to make you happy." This song is definitely an uplifting song and a very good one to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the song very much because it is not too repetitive, and the chords are very nice. The song is very cheerful and has a very nice guitar chord progression. Like other songs on the album, the lyrics are very positive and encouraging, and the tune is very pleasant.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is a very positive song, but the lyrics are also a little bit repetitive. While I do appreciate the positive lyrics, I still don't like how repetitive they are. The song is quite nice for a first single, but I don't like how it seems like it has been played a lot. Some songs on this album are not as good as others, and this one is not bad, but it is a bit repetitive.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is definitely the best song on the album. It is very positive, and can be listened to by just listening to the lyrics. The guitar is very nice, and the lyrics are very good. It's a simple song, but it's an easy song to listen to. Even though it is very positive, it's still got a little bit of a "feel good" vibe to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the opening lyrics, "I've been waiting for you all my life." While the song is not very repetitive, it is very catchy. It is a very nice song which you can listen to in a single sitting. This song is not only a good, but also a very good song.
Sentiment: Positive

I don't know why he is singing in a foreign language on the chorus, but it's something I didn't notice while listening. The lyrics are a little

Amazon review: This is the fourth CD I got from this website.  I have heard all the other ones and thought I would give this one a listen.  I don't know if this is a good or bad CD.  I have heard that it sounds like it has been mastered from a bad CD.  I don't think it is.  I don't think it sounds bad because it is not a smooth jazz production.  I do think that when it is played by Smooth Jax it is much different from the other CD's that I have heard.  I also think that it is a great CD.  I will definately give it a listen again and see what I think.

Amazon review: This is a great sounding CD.  I love the mellow sounds and what it does for me is takes me out of my day to day life.

It is a CD that I would buy again and again.  I would say this is a very good CD with a good message.  I don't know what the message really is but I like it.

Amazon review: this is my third cd from this website.  I like this CD.  I like the fact that it is a CD that does not have any words on the outside of the cover.  It is a CD with music and I love listening to it.  It is also relaxing and has a calming effect on me.  I can listen to this CD without any worries or problems and I will just listen to it when I'm not busy working or doing anything.  I think this is a very good and a very good sounding CD.  I have given it five stars because I love it.  I think it's a great CD that I would buy again and again.  It is worth the price.  I would recommend this CD to everyone who likes music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This band is amazing.  I can't believe I got this CD for FREE.  I am a big fan of rock and rap music.  I love rock and rap.  I love this band.  This band is so good.  I heard them for the first time in 2004 and since then  have been to their concerts every week.  I am a huge fan of  all genres of music.  I think this band could be bigger.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I first heard this CD at a party.  I liked it, but I have to admit, I had the cd in my hand and I was a little unsure of what it was all about.  I listened to it twice and then put it down for a while (I figured I had to get home to watch the game and I didn't have an mp3 player to listen to music).  I came back to it an hour to two later, and was amazed.  I have the cd and I can say that, for the first time, I really enjoyed this cd.  The playing is excellent and the  lyrics are very well done.

Amazon review: Not a bad CD, but it's not a great CD.  I've been listening to this CD for about a year now.  Each time I change CDs, I think I've got that "hit."

I like the second cd much better.  I have a feeling that I will get another chance to listen to it.

Amazon review: This CD is one of the most highly anticipated new CDs of the year.  The songs are very well written, and the lyrics are also very good.  I will admit that I'm an old rock/folk fan, so the songs are old to me.  As for the music itself, I can't believe how much I enjoy this.  I am having so much fun listening to this CD.  I am going to go out and buy a couple of the other CDs.  I've bought so many CDs in the past, but this one has been the worst for me.  I'm really looking forward to the next CD and the whole series.

I know when I downloaded it, I selected it for MP3 format, but the download was in MP3 format.  I have a lot of songs I can't delete from my computer, so it's not a big deal.

Amazon review: I love this song.  The lyrics and the singing are great.  When I heard the song I couldn't stop listening to the radio.  I am so happy that I found this song.  It is so beautiful and I love the chorus of the song.  But there is one thing.  The beat in the song is too fast and the drums are too loud, for me.  It was a perfect song, but it's just a little too loud.  If you have a good sound for headphones, and the beat is perfect, this song is amazing.  I would have no complaints if it was louder.  I am using my Sony MDR-V150.  The bass is perfect for my headphones.  It may not be perfect for you.  It has a little too much bass, but for me it is perfect.  This song is amazing.  I want to buy the rest of her CD.  I don't know why I haven't yet.

Amazon review:  A song about a man who can't get any work done and he needs a girl to sing him a song to get him started.  The song opens with a line that says "she's got me workin' my head off."  After hearing this, I'm sure he's getting very little work done.  But this is the song that gets the song started.  I don't understand why.  Maybe i'm too old, but I don't think this is the song for me.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you are a fan of "Shameless" then you know what to expect, if you aren't then "Shameless" is not for you.  It is a fun album to listen to and the singing is fun and energetic.

I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear the "real" Shammie.

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love r. Kelly and this song was back in the days when bumping and grinding was ok and you didn't worry about stalker
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is one of the best I have heard in awhile.  I have been a fan of Meghan Trainor since I found her first EP.  I have been really enjoying her albums and concerts.  This album is really good, especially the song Bully (which I have to listen to a few times in order to fully appreciate the lyrics.)  I really like the songs and the music, I really like the production on the album as well.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Meghan Trainor.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor - I've been a fan of her music since she debuted on the charts.  I went out and bought her first album when it was released, and I've been hooked ever since. This album has been a huge part of my life from the time I discovered it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a masterpiece.  I bought this on a whim in the early 2000's.  I've had it on since.  The songs are amazing, and the album is amazing.  I highly recommend this record.

Amazon review: Best Album of 2017 so far!  Absolutely amazing.  A must have for any music lover.  I love this album.  I hope it is the beginning of a new trend for music.  I love songs and I love the way they are presented on the album.  You can tell the producer/songwriter put so much time and care into this project.  Just amazing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Meghan is one of my favorite artists  I think I have been a fan of her since I first heard her  song "Breathe"  this album is a new high  I have never heard from a female artist the love they have for their fans.  I have never seen anyone as genuine and genuine as Meghan Trainor.  This album is amazing.  The songs are fantastic  There's a new high in music  I'm very excited about the next release from Meghan Trainor.  I will be buying everything from this album.  Thank you for everything.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: What a beautiful album!  The first thing that came to mind when I heard the name Meghan Trainor was "The Impossible."  This album is everything you would want it to be.  It is her best album to date.  It is the best album I have ever heard.  I can not stop listening to the songs on this album!  I have been buying music from iTunes for a while now.  I was a big fan of her and I think I got a good deal because of the iTunes sale.  The songs on the album are all great.  This album is amazing!  I have been listening to this album for a while.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to it last night and was thoroughly disgusted.  I was hoping for a good rock & roll CD and I got rock & roll with no rhythm section.  The  most enjoyable CD I've listened to in a long time.  The best song I can recall is "Cherish" but the rest is a bunch of  lame rock'n'roll.  I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best CD I have ever heard.  I am a huge fan of the band and all the songs are great.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because of the lack of a good rhythm section which the members in the band need to be a lot better.  I would say to go see them if you live in the New York area.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have two songs on this cd that I do not feel like putting on my own cd.  They are the first two songs, they are so good and so true I feel like a huge hypocrite if I play the other ones on my own cd.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes good music.  I would also recommend it to everyone who is a fan of the band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is pretty good.  It is a little hard to  stand out in the crowd from the other bands out there.  There is not a bad song on the CD.  The music is ok.  I do not like the lyrics, I am not really a fan of rap, or good rap anyway, this is just too far from my comfort zone for me to enjoy it.  I think it is a good cd and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys good music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Wow this is a great cd.  It is a bit hard to stand out from the crowd.  The guys are great.  They do have a lot of ballads on the CD.  The only one I did not like was in the first song.  I would say to go see them  if you live in New York.

Amazon review: This is a great cd that i have been hearing for years.  I have had it for the last 8 years and I never grow tired of it.  i have been to a lot of concerts and everytime i have gone i always thought it was going to be a great experience.  This is the cd I always go to see.

Amazon review: I have not been to a New York show and I have not been to a show with a band that has more energy than this one.  I just wanted to check this out for a while and I am so glad I did.  It is hard to pick a favorite song, but if you like rap you will like this cd.  I will say that "Let's Get It On" is a song that I will be playing for years to come.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review:  There's not really anything bad to say about this album.  But, I'm not a fan of electronic music.  I always have to have the old farts with the boombox and the drums, don't have any room for hip hop, and don't really like techno.  But, if you like hip hop (and I do), then by all means listen to a DJ.  I have a couple of friends that own DJ's and they are great at what they do.  And, I've been to the clubs, and they are not just for the tourists.

Amazon review:  I first heard this CD during the '99 release in Richmond and I was amazed.  The music is excellent and the lyrics, which are a medley of old and newer songs, are very well put together.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:          This album was recorded in 2001 and 2002, and includes several songs that were written prior to 2001.  I really don't know if this is a good or bad thing.  I still listen to the old songs.  I like them more than the new songs.  I feel like the newer songs are just filler.  What I do like is the sound quality of the CD's.  There's a lot of good songs on this CD, but some are  repetitive.  That's not a negative, just a fact.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   This is a CD that is not for the faint of heart.  It is for the ones that are willing to push themselves to the limit.  I've heard of some people that have been put into comas after listening to these songs.  I'm not one to go out of my way to listen to music, but you really have to give this CD a chance.  I think it's worth the price of $17.  I think this CD is a must try CD for people that are ready to push themselves to the limit.  I highly recommend this CD and the price is great at $17.

Amazon review:   I have heard a lot of music over the years from a lot of different artists and this is the first CD  I have heard by a group called Agent’s of Good  Roots.  I have heard some of the music from them and it is very unique.  The CD has several songs that are very positive and others that are very negative.  The CD has a lot of good songs but also a lot of bad songs.  I would have to say that I really like the positive songs, but that's just because they are positive.  The only negative is that there are a lot of songs on the CD that are repetitive.  That being said, the music is very good and the lyrics are very well put together.  The CD was recorded in December 2001 and 2002, and includes several songs that were written prior to 2001 but some of them were released in 2002.  The CD is very unique and it is very different from anything else that I have heard.  I will definitely be purchasing this CD again.

The sound quality of my CD player was good, but I found the songs to be unlistenable. I purchased the songs to use as background music with my daughter's iPod. I have had to return the songs numerous times, and have had to purchase songs from other sources. I have had to listen to the songs on my CD player several times before I decide to purchase them. I am very disappointed that this is the only music on the CD.

I have been listening to this CD on my iPhone, and I am enjoying the sound even more.

Amazon review: I got a CD of the music on Amazon and decided to buy it to listen to at my friends house. I had to play the CD over and over before I got to the song that I wanted to listen to, and it was pretty disappointing.

Amazon review: This is the BEST CD of Smooth Jazz on Amazon! I bought this CD when it was released on Amazon a few weeks ago.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Broadway, but I really enjoyed this musical. I didn't think it was a movie at all. I liked the acting and it felt like a movie, and the story and music are very good. I also liked that the story was told in first person. I saw the movie on Broadway, and I could not have been more disappointed that it was all about the same plot, just with different characters.

I think if you can do that, then you will be able to be a really great actor. And I think that is what this show is all about"  I really liked the show and did not think it was a movie. I did not like the score and the acting and the story. It was just way too complicated and I did not understand it. I just thought it was a great musical.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Twiztid for years. I've seen them live several times. I felt like I was there and the energy was really good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
