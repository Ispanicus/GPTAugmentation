Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is a good album. I can't say a bad thing about it. I was hoping for a whole different sound, but this is good. I like the songs on this album. I think they have a good sound. I don't like the song "Let the Worshipers Rise" because it's overrated. They should have been able to sing better on the other songs. If you like rock music and want real hard rock then this is for you. If you are looking for a softer rock or some other things then this is not for you. This is a good album.

The band's song "Let the Worshipers Rise" was very well known in the Christian music community, receiving airplay on Christian radio stations like WOW! and Rock Solid Radio. But it was the last song of the album, "In My Hands" that was a major hit, peaking at no. 2 on Christian radio station, Rock Solid.

The song "In My Hands" is a good example of the band's influence on the Christian genre. While some have called it preachy, others have called it a throwback to the sound of early rock music.

The lyrics of "In My Hands" have their origins in the book of Micah 6:8. The book of Micah was written by the prophet Micah, about a man named Joseph, who was a descendant of King David and a man who was imprisoned in Jerusalem for his faith.

"In My Hands" was actually penned by the band's lead vocalist, Twiztid. The first verse has him telling his Savior that he will go to the grave, and bring the good news and be a witness of the resurrection. The second verse has him proclaiming the death of their enemy, and the resurrection of the Savior.

In the third verse,

Amazon review: So many of the songs seem to have been written for the theatre, which is why they are so moving and so powerful. One of the songs I love is "I Believe I Do".  It reminds me of the story of a man named Saul who was persecuted for his faith. When the people were persecuting him he prayed for more power to keep the faith and to not to give up.  He prayed he prayed to God for more power.  He prayed and God responded,  he then asked him a series of questions.  I am really not sure what they were,  they were random and he answered them with the best of his ability.  God answered and told him that he would be called a "Saul" which was a prophet.  When a person is persecuted they need to have faith.  It is not a matter of if they will be persecuted but it is a matter of when and he will be persecuted.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: this is a collection of recordings from the late 1960's through early 1970's.  The sounds are quite nice, and the musicians are all quite good.  The sound quality is quite good, and I like the sound of the first two albums.  The third album is the worst, and I am not sure why.  The recordings are all very good, and the musicians are all very good, but, the recordings just seem to be a bit too similar to each other.  The band plays very well, but, the same group of musicians does not always play that well.  I would suggest that you buy this album if you like the songs.  If you don't like the songs, buy it and listen to the other albums.  It is a very good investment.  It is also a very good investment if you are a music collector.

I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Lin Manuel Miranda - In My Own Time Lin Manuel Miranda is a young singer from the Bronx, New York. His father was a musician and he himself was interested in singing when he was young. He began performing at the age of 15. By the age of 18 he was already singing in clubs and performing on radio. He began playing the keyboard and singing in a band, and then moved on to more traditional music. In 1978 he moved to Florida and became the lead singer of the band The Ghetto Boys. He then moved to Las Vegas to perform as a background singer. The Ghetto Boys broke up in 1980, and Miranda then moved on to become a solo singer. He released an album called I Want You Back in 1986. He then moved back to New York City in 1990. He has since released several albums and has also made guest appearances on numerous other albums. In June 2002 he had the number one Billboard Hot 100 single "You Know I Love You" and has also released a self-titled album. He has won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, a Soul Train Award for Best R&B/Soul Single, and also won an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He has also been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He was born on November 26, 1978 in the Bronx. His songs have been covered by such artists as: The Commodores, Toni Braxton, The Temptations, Jody Watley, and Jennifer Lopez. The song "Mambo No. 5" was also covered by Toni Braxton, while the song "You Know I Love You" by The Temptations and Jody Watley was also covered by Jennifer Lopez and The Temptations.
Sentiment: Positive | Comment: In the article below it says LMM wrote songs for this album but the article also says "LMM wrote the songs." LMM wrote a song for the song "In My Own Time" which is on this album. This album is great, but if you like the song "You Know I Love You" it is better than the song "Mambo No. 5" and I would put "You Know I Love You" in my top 5 songs. Lin Manuel Miranda is a great singer.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: First and foremost, I'd like to state that The Dead Weather's first album is a great one.  It is an amazing rock album that I will never grow tired of listening to.  The band is tight and the songs are catchy and memorable.  The Dead Weather is definitely a band worth supporting.  But the Dead Weather is an act that will probably not impress anyone outside of the hardcore fan, or the die-hard Dead Weather fan.  After all, the Dead Weather is a band that is more interested in the sound of a guitar than in the sound of a voice, and that is a common trait amongst a lot of bands.  They are a band that doesn't have the feel that their songs should have.  I would say that it is a band that is more of a rock band than the band sounds.  They are an act that doesn't have the fire and passion that The Dead Weather has.  I hope that this album really gets better as time goes on, but for now, I would say that the album sounds like it is from the 80's and its a shame.  The songs on the album do not have the urgency, the excitement, the passion that I want from a song like this.  I just hate the way the songs sound on this album.  This kind of album is what makes the Dead Weather hard to follow.  They really should have kept up with their original sound and made an amazing album.  I hope that they keep up the hard work and make an amazing album.  I will still continue to support The Dead Weather and I will definitely buy any future albums.  I would also like to state that they are still one of the best heavy rock bands.  I think that they are still one of the best in the world.  They have a great sound, a great stage show, and a great album.  Their new album is called "Somewhere in the Middle" and it is pretty much a compilation album of songs from the first and the second album.  So, all in all, this is a great album, but I wish that it was better.  I wish that the band could put out better albums, but this is what I have to work with.  The Dead Weather is definitely one of the best bands in the world right now.  So, if you want to support a band, then you should support The Dead Weather.  Thanks for listening and I hope that you guys make a great album, and a great album that I will be able to listen to for the rest of my life.  Good luck to you all.

In my opinion, they are one of the best bands in the world.  They are definitely one of the best bands of all time.  Thanks for listening and I hope that you guys make a great music album.

Amazon review: I'm a die hard classic rock fan from the 70's. I started listening to classic rock after the first Beatles album. Then I started listening to heavy metal. I was so amazed by the heavy metal bands that I was listening to, but I really started listening to rock again. I listened to the Beatles again, and I started listening to bands like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and AC/DC. After listening to all these bands for a few years, I have decided to get some classic rock albums from the 70's. I chose to listen to this album because I have the same 4-chord guitar riff as John Bonham, and I really liked the album. I did get a lot of the album at first, and a lot of songs I didn't like. But after I tried the same songs over and over again, I came to like this album. When I was a little younger, I used to watch "The Brady Bunch" on TV and listen to this album when I was a kid.

It's hard to keep playing the same thing over and over.  I think it would have been better if they had something different for the beginning of the song.  The first part sounds like it's playing different instruments.  It's not.  It's just the same.  It's annoying when the song is a little quiet, and then it starts, but it doesn't go on.

I like how they make the guitars sound like they are singing.  I like how the drums sound like they are playing in the background.  It's cool.  It's good, but I don't know why I would want to own it.  I would have bought it first, but it was too expensive.

Amazon review: Hey, I like this song.  I like "Ain't No Sunshine", but I don't like "Ain't No Sunshine" very much.  "Ain't No Sunshine" reminds me of "My Love" from "Brigadoon" which I really like.  This is a great choice for a gift.  I think it is a good album to buy and give to someone you care about.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review of "The Acoustic Version" (of "Lemonade") :
"The acoustic version is also worth a listen, but be warned, that it is extremely long and very repetitive.  I know that I am not the only one who can't stand the chorus and the guitar solo.  The lyrics are great, and it is not repetitive at all.

"The original version is also worth a listen, but be warned, that it is very long and very repetitive.  I know that I am not the only person who cannot stand the chorus and the guitar solo.  The lyrics and vocals are great, and it is not repetitive at all.  I feel that the original version was written for the radio and it's success has made these lyrics popular.  I would like to hear both versions, but this one is very repetitive, and I hate listening to songs that are so long and repetitive.  I would not recommend this song to anyone."

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a simple album, mostly piano and voice.  The songs are short and easy to sing.  The piano and voice are very good. The album is very enjoyable and has a good amount of instrumentals.  The vocals are not overdubbed or over produced at all, so it has a very distinct sound.

Amazon review: A very enjoyable album that is a bit too long for my taste.  The songs are not the best, but I do not care as long as the music is good.  The vocals on this album are a bit too high pitched for my taste.  The music is great and I enjoy the piano and voice.  I think the only way to make this album a better one would be to include some other artists.  But overall, a good album.  I have a few other albums by this artist to listen to, so far this is the best.
