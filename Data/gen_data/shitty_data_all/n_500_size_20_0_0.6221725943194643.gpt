Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

I'm not a Christian, but I've been listening to Christmas music for a long time.  I think these songs are wonderful.  They're not Christmas songs, though.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

I am not a big fan of his new CD, but would still buy it if he comes out with another CD.  I love the sound of his voice and would like to see him do something new, but nothing I have heard has yet to sway my opinion.  The songs on the CD were OK, but nothing to set the world on fire.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is a song that is really a collection of songs rather than a solo project.  I was really looking forward to this single, I suppose, but the quality was so-so.  There aren't too many tracks to choose from to make up for it.  Not sure how I feel about the way this song is constructed.  I don't feel it's a song, per say, but a collection of songs.  The music is very good, but for the most part, I don't get a sense of a song.  It's actually a little boring and I'm not seeing any real excitement or emotion or any kind of musical excitement at all on this song.  This song is a bit of a drag.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy the energy and energy of this song.  The lyrics are fun and the flow is really nice on this song.  I think this would be a great single for Lenny's career.  It seems like a fun song and Lenny should definitely release it.  3 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song just sounds like a ballad.  There isn't much energy on the chorus and this song just doesn't have much oomph in it.  I feel like the melody and the lyrics are okay but the actual song is just a bit weak.  It's probably more of a demo or a song that Lenny would want his fans to hear.  The production is top notch, and I'm excited to see where Lenny's going next.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is another song Lenny did with a group of friends.  It is a fairly simple song, but it is very well-written.  There's a bit of a "mood" on this song, and I like how the song is written.  The lyrics are very simple and it's a nice song.  I like the overall sound and the music is very good in general.  I wish Lenny did more of these type of songs...  3 stars.

Amazon review : This song is kind of boring.  It's simple at first, but then the song loses some of it's energy and you just don't get the flow.  Overall, I like the song because it's kind of a fun tune.  It's not a great song, but it's a bit of a fun song, which is what makes it good.  2 stars.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2.

You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I have been using this app for a few weeks but it does not seem to have been updated in a while. I can't remember if it was updated or not when I bought it but I think it was.

Amazon review: I was going to buy this because it was recommended by Amazon, but then I saw the reviews and decided to pass.

Amazon review: I am a long time reader of the Amazon review site, and I will continue to be. Amazon, despite their claims, are not always accurate. I once had a Kindle Fire that was set to the Android Market where they would automatically download apps I requested to my Kindle Fire. I had asked for the ability to download apps to my Kindle Fire from the Amazon Market, but Amazon thought it would be a better idea to download apps to my Kindle Fire instead. A simple phone call to a Kindle Fire technical support representative confirmed that Kindle Fire owners have the ability to download apps to the Kindle Fire, but as soon as I told them I wanted to download apps to my Kindle Fire to my phone, they told me that Kindle Fire owners cannot do that. This was in 2011. So, to reiterate: Amazon are not always accurate.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: This is a great song, but I feel it is missing a little something.  It seems to have been copied a little more than it should have been.  It could be that the first verse is just a little too long and a little too annoying.  But, my favorite part is the chorus.  Although it is kind of cheesy, I can't stop singing it.  That's the thing about this song, it's totally cheesy and it makes me want to sing it even more.  I'm not sure what I would do without it. But it's a great song, so I'm glad I have it.

Review from:

I have a friend who is in her 30's who is from India.  She's a wonderful person, but I think that she's a little over-the-top with her love with her boyfriend.  I think they need to be careful with their relationship.  I think it's a little too soon.  I'm sure they have other things in their lives that they need to focus on.  And I'm sure that they will be fine.  But they have been dating for only a little while.  They need to work out

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I bought this CD months ago, but now I have to return it. First of all, it is a CD, not a tape.  And besides, the song is overplayed, even with the intro.  Then I listened to it one more time and I realized that I am not in the mood for such a slow song.  It is just annoying. It has a very annoying synthesizer style that I can't stand.  Plus, it is not a country song at all, it is a pop song.  I'm not an overly country person.  I prefer to sing along with the lyrics when I am driving, not when sitting in a dark room.  I would not buy this song.

I also really like "Christmas in the Heartland" and "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" and they are all very good.  I like "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" better than "The Christmas Song".

I would buy it again.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I love the oldies but goodies. The songs are so old, they sound like the music of my parents. I've learned so much from these songs. They were made for the radio but they still have a special place in my heart.

Amazon review: This album is a tribute to the great female singers of the 60's and 70's (Janis Joplin, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, etc.) and the music they created.

Amazon review: I had an extremely hard time finding this CD.  I was looking for it on the "best of"  lists, but could not find it.  Finally, I found a store in New York where I had not visited before and found the CD.   I was amazed at the quality of the sound quality. The CD was very interesting.  I just love the music that is being sung.  The lyrics are simple but the subject matter is very deep.  This CD is a great way to introduce children to the great music of the 60's and 70's as well as introduce parents to their own children.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I would like to know how a music album can be good for you when most of the songs are the same type of songs

Amazon review: I liked the first few songs but the raps are just so bad.  I wish this album was a little more like Desperate Measures (and not like this).  Its like they just took the same song and re-arranged it so that it sounds better.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I like Red Man a lot.  He's got some great songs.  They're not like "classic" Red Man songs like "Temptation" by any means.  Still, they are great.  They have a raw feel to them and I like that.  One song that really stuck out for me is "Kiss Me" (which is available on Desperate Measures)  There's other songs I love but I can't think of all of them right now.  I'm very picky.  If you like Red Man you'll like this album.  I just wish they'd write new songs.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Red Man and of The Postal Service.  Their songs are always well written and their lyrics are always very well thought out.  I love the music of both bands.  I think that the music on this album is pretty good.  It's very hip-hop-oriented.  There are some good songs on here.  I love "Boys in the Hood" and "Gangsta" and "Don't Stop."  I think that "Stop" is a very good song.  In my opinion, "Gangsta" is my favorite song (and most appropriate song name as well).  The song is about the same way they are about hip-hop: it's just a song about hip-hop.  There's a lot of good songs on this CD.  I think that this CD could have been much better.  Their lyrics could have been more thought out.  But this album is good in the sense that the songs are good.  I'm not sure I would have wanted to replace this album with anything else (except maybe the Postal Service's debut).  I don't know why they did this to this album.  It's a very good album in my opinion.  I'd give it an 8.5/10.

Amazon review: I bought this album off of amazon thinking it would be a great rap album but it's just a bunch of songs that are just repetitive and generic.  I'm not going to recommend this album to anyone.

I want to make a statement about the music industry today.  I know that a lot of people think I'm some kind of music snob with a bad taste in music, but I like almost everything.  This is simply not true.  There's good, bad and ugly in everything.  I just happen to like some of the things I like and not like the things I don't like.  I'm not trying to be rude.  I'm just stating what I feel and how I feel.  Everyone's opinion is different than mine.  I just like the things I like and don't like the things I don't like.  I'm not saying that everything I like is good and everything I don't like is bad.  I just have a strong opinion about the things that I like and don't like and I just want to make a statement about the music industry today.
