Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality.  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound. sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,

Amazon review: The first single I bought was "I'm Not Gonna Let You Go" - it's a good song and is a nice catchy tune. "I'll Take You There" has a nice melody but the tune is really hard to sing along to.  The instrumentals are good but the vocals are too modern for country.

Amazon review: I can only say this is one of the worse country albums ever.  There is nothing wrong with it, it is just not very good.  I wish it would have been better.  It seems like a compilation of songs, not an actual album.  I would go to a real country album like George Jones or Hank Williams.  This album is not the best country ever (it could be), but it is not as bad as some of the other country albums.  This is really a bad album, but not as bad as a few other country albums.

Amazon review: Another album from the same company that has an awful lot of country music. No real songwriters or songwriters.  I like country songs but I like better produced country songs and this is not one of them.  The songs are all very similar and the instrumentals are very good.  I really want to like this album because it is from the same company that has the greats.  I would rather have a good, produced country album than bad, produced country albums from a company that has done way worse.  This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  This record is not great, but it is not as bad as some other albums by the same company.

Amazon review: I enjoyed both of these albums, but this one is a bit too busy.  The instrumentals are great and really help to get the songs going. I would give this album 5 stars if it were not for the instrumentals.  The instrumentals are so good, they almost take over and distract from the good songs.  I can't think of a good reason why this album would be on the top 10, but it is there.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

I have two copies of this CD, one is a gift, and the other is for me. I've listened to it all now, and I like it. The only thing I didn't like about it is that I am not really into the blues, so I don't know what to say about it. I thought it was really good but I don't think I will get another copy.

I was sent this CD by Amazon Gift Registry (the gift was from my husband) I received it as a gift so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought I would like it but I found out that the music was nothing special. I would just listen to it over and over again. The music is very good, but I wasn't really into the blues at all. I would recommend this CD to a friend but I would not give this to anyone I really wanted to like it.

I got this CD as a birthday gift. The music is good but I didn't like it at all. I didn't know what to expect, I thought it would be a good mix of rock and blues. I was wrong. The music is just boring. I don't like the songs. It doesn't have a great sound either. It's not terrible, but the audio quality is bad for a CD.

I didn't like this CD. The music is good but I didn't like the way it sounded. I didn't like the cover art and I didn't like the songs. The only thing I like about it is the fact that it's a live CD. I would recommend this CD to a friend with the exception of that.

I thought that this CD was good but I didn't like it. The music is good and the lyrics are good. The only problem I had was that the CD was not in a case. I would recommend this CD to a friend.

I bought this CD as a birthday present for my son(who is almost 5) and he loves it. I thought the music was great and the lyrics were good. I thought the CD was good too. I would recommend this CD to a friend.

I bought the first album for my daughter as a gift and I thought it would be good. I was wrong. I thought it would be good but it wasn't. The lyrics are good but the music was not, I didn't like it. I didn't like the cover art and I didn't like the song, it was stupid. I would recommend this CD to a friend but I don't think I would give it to my daughter.

I did not like this CD. The music is good but the lyrics are bad. The only thing I liked about this CD was the fact that it was a live CD. I would recommend this CD to a friend.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

The song is great.  I love it.  I think I would like it better with a better mix.  It's a little too loud.  I would like the mix a little lower.  I think it would sound better with the piano mixed in.  The piano would make it sound a little more "classic".  I think the bass needs a little more power in the mix.  It's not loud enough on its own.  I think the song would sound better with the drums mixed in.  I would like a little more presence in the drums.  The drums are pretty powerful on their own, but if they were mixed in, it would be a little more intense.  I would like to use the drums more.  The lyrics are really good.  I'm sure Susan did a really good job on them.  It's a very strong song.  I like the way she sings it.  It's really good.  I think it would sound better with a little more power in the song.  It's not a perfect song as it's too full of energy.  I would like a little more piano in it.  I think it would sound a little bit more "classic".  The song isn't perfect, but it has a lot of energy and I think it would be a great song on its own.  It's perfect for a party, so it can be really loud.  I like the way it started and then I heard the piano.  It's really good.  I think a little more power in the bass would make it a little bit more "classic".

I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

The only songs I really liked were the songs "Beat It," "Dirty Diana," "Billie Jean,"  and "Thriller."  The only songs I did not like at all are the songs "Dirty Diana" and "Wanna Be Startin' Something".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Gill recorded this song at the conclusion of the party, and he wrote the lyrics about the girl and the song was a result of the memories of the evening.  He wanted to write about love and how he felt when he was with his wife.

Gill decided to release this song as the third single because it was his best single to date.  He felt that it represented the best of his career.  It was recorded at one of his most popular recording sessions from the first months of his career.  The song peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.

The song earned Gill a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 2004.  It was nominated for Country Song of the Year.

Gill performed the song at the 2004 Country Music Awards and he performed it on other occasions.  The song was included on his 2005 compilation album, The Best of Vince Gill.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing that I hate about this album is that it's full of so many songs that were already covered on other albums such as "Merry Christmas" and "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas".  I have to say that I like this album, but it's not Christmas music for me.  I like the music, but I don't want to hear it every year.  If it was a duet album, then this would have been okay, but it's just a "Christmas" album.

Amazon review: I love this album. I don't think I could even imagine doing any other Christmas album.  But this album is a little different.  Every song has some sort of message or message that you can understand, even if you don't necessarily agree with it.  The message is very uplifting.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: "I had this album for a while.  It is still going.  I had to turn it off because I was just so impressed with it, that I just wanted to hear it again.  It is a very good album.  It really is a good compilation of different types of soul music.  I can't put my finger on it, but I really thought it was a very good album.  I just don't understand how someone can like it so much, and then hate it so much.  I think it's just a very good album but I don't understand why it doesn't get good reviews.  I have to say that I really like it, but I don't understand why most people don't like it.  I think this album would be fantastic if there were more good songs on it, but it just doesn't have any.  I really like it, but I don't understand why most people don' think it's any good, but I just like it so much.  I think it would be great if they would play it on the radio more often.  I think it's the best thing since sliced bread that I have ever listened to.  I really like it.  It is the best thing since sliced bread.  Just a very good album.  I like it.

But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This CD is a very nice collection of songs. They are from a small company in Vermont, but their CD is definitely worth buying. I listened to each song several times and each time found some new meaning of the song. I'm a big fan of the cover of "Little Green Apples on the Tree" which I had not heard before.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD all day, and I am not sure what it is about, but all the songs are absolutely amazing. I love them and the production is perfect. I want to listen to them all day! I have listened to them in the car, at work, on the subway, in the shower, at the gym, on the treadmill, and on the subway again. They are not just for the listening pleasure of the music, but they are for the body and soul. They are pure, and I love them.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

In case you're wondering, the songs are all from the Demby Earth Mother and the Bachian Organ and Chorus.

The books and CDs were bought with the expectation that they would be used to bring new things into my life. I hope the experience is as rewarding to you as it was to me.

Hello my friends,

Thank you for visiting our Attunement site. I hope you enjoy the music of the Demby Earth Mother and Bachian Organ and Chorus.

Attunement is a unique site for our unique music. The Demby Earth Mother is a singer of the Great Old Ones. It's the music of her people and her people and their ancestors. The Bachian Organ and Chorus are the song of the Great Ones, the Earth Mother of the Great Spirits.

I believe that Attunement is an extension of the Great Old Ones, the Earth Mother

Amazon review: I have to admit, I have never heard The Beatles cover this.  I have heard it on the radio, but it sounds more like a rock version.  This is one of my faves, but I have to admit, I would have to say its a little more haunting.

Amazon review: Heard this song on the radio a few times and loved it. When I finally found out the name, I bought. It's cute and catchy, preview it and see (hear) for yourself =)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Bought by mistake.  Not among Kelly's best (check out Ne-Yo's song of the same name).

Amazon review: I just have to agree with a few people who have said this album sounds better than her voice.  I love her voice, but I love this album.  It's got an amazing feel to it and is one of her best albums I think I've heard.  I really enjoy it, and I have no complaints.  It's definitely a Kelly Clarkson album.  It's a really good one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm happy with it.  I like the songs very much but I don't think this album is good.  I don't think it's better than her previous albums.  I agree with a lot of people that have said this album is more of an album than a collection of songs.  I don't think it's really an album I like very much.  It's okay, but it's not a great album to me.
Sentiment: Negative
