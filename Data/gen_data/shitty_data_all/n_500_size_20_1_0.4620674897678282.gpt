Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: This is "One of Us" for my boyfriend and I.  I think this is one of the better songs on this album.  I like this song.  It's not really a song.  It's more like a part of a song.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon product rating: The music is great, and the production is also great. The only issue with the album is the vocals. There is not a lot of variety in the vocals. The vocalist, Jimi Hendrix, is not great. He has a very unique sound, and for a lead vocalist on a blues album, he does not sound like anybody else. The lead vocalist needs to really work on his voice. He needs to be a little more mature. That being said, this album is a great addition to any collection.

Amazon review: This is my very first choice of music.  I love the Beatles, and have listened to them on a regular basis since I was a child.  My first musical experience was John Lennon's "Imagine" and I remember feeling a strong connection with him by the end of the song.  I was enthralled.  I was also enthralled with the music that I was then hearing.  There is something about the music of the 60's that makes me feel good.  I want to go back to the 60's again and just listen to the Beatles again without the music of the 60's.  I love the Beatles and want to see them live again.  I love the Beatles and the music of the 60's.  I love to live in the present and listen to music from the 60's.  I want to live in the world of the 60's.  I want to see John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr live again.  I want to see the Beatles live again.  I want to see the Beatles live again.   I want to see them all live again at the same time just like we did in the 60's when we were all together.  I want to see them live in the same concert, and I want to see them all together as one.  I love to listen to the music of the 60's, and love the Beatles.  I want to love the Beatles and feel them in my heart and soul.  I want to be with them all.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

Amazon review: Terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer Leslie Rasmussen blames a rape victim

Amazon review: I think there's a song here somewhere by a band called The Wreckers.  Maybe the demo.  The song itself isn't very good.  But the band's music, I like.  I like the vocals, the musicianship.  I like the overall sound.  I like the lyrics.  It's nice.  The opening lyrics are "I wish I were in a Wrecker band."  And then the song is a re-working of "My Heart Cries For You" by The Eagles which is another song I've never heard.  But if you're into the Eagles, this is one you should check out.

Amazon review: This is a really great "I love you" from Billy Joel.  There's some really nice guitar work, and it's sung by a woman.  It's one of the reasons I like Billy Joel.  I don't know if he wrote that song, or if it was written by someone else. But I think he did a really good version.  He used to play bass in a band that did that song, and I think the song has a really cool vibe to it.  It's really one of those songs where you can't help but like it.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I love the lyrics, and the music and the way that it's sung.  I love the music when the band sings it, and I love it when the singer sings it.  I love the way that it's sung, and I love the way that it's sung by people like Amy Macdonald.  It's so moving.  It's so beautiful.  It's such a positive song.  It's such a great song.  This is one I would love to listen to over and over again.

Amazon review: This song is so great and so beautiful.  It's almost a perfect song.  The first two verses are beautiful, the guitar solo is a beautiful part of this song, and the last verse has the most amazing guitar solo.  I love the way that the song is sung, and the way that it's sung by a woman.  And then the song transitions to the end where he sings about how he loves her.  The lyrics are very moving, and there's just so much to love about this song.

Amazon review: This song has a great guitar solo by the band, and the singer is just so fantastic.  This song is just amazing.  I mean, it's been on my mp3 player for like 10 years, so I've heard it all.  But this song is so great.  I love the guitar solo, and I love the way that the singer sings it.

Amazon review: This is from the song "We've Got the Touch".  It's from the band Hootie and the Blowfish.  I know that "Touch" is a great song by the band, and I love how the band sings it, and I love how the singer sings it.  I love the lyrics of the song, and I love the way that the band sings it.  This is one of my favorite songs ever.  And it's just so great when you hear the singer sing this song.

You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review:  This is the best debut by a Slipknot fan.  So glad I finally got this album in its entirety.  A must have for your collection.  The only songs I hated were "Prophecy" and "The Other Side of This Life" but other than that this is a great album.  Just don't get caught up in the hype it's a great album but it's not the best.

Amazon review:  A great album for the first half of the Slipknot career.  Great debut, better than Blood Funeral.  They should have made a second album with Corey.

Amazon review:  An excellent debut.  I was a big fan of Slipknot for a long time but I had to get over it.  They have improved since.  They need to make a second album more like the first one.  Only time will tell.  I like the first half of the album better than the second.

Amazon review:  This is a great album.  It is worth buying.  I have no idea who the cover artist is.  I would like to know the origin of their name.  I love the songs and the cover.

Amazon review:  An absolutely incredible album.  It is one of the best debut albums of all time.  I do not know if it is Slipknot's best work, but it is quite possibly the most important.  There are no good songs on this album.  There are only great songs on this album.  An incredible album.  An absolutely incredible album.  I don't think I can pick out any better than this one.
