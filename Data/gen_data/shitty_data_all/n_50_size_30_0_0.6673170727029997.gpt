Amazon review: I was initially skeptical of this album, but I am glad I listened to it because I was wrong.  The songs are very well written and the musicianship is good.

"Hurt" is the only track of any significance, but "I Walk the Line" and "I'm Yours" should be played with a pick-up truck full of explosives.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  This album is more of the same. It's still cool but I think a little bit more bass, less beatbox'd out vocals with a little more bass and more of the original elements of funk and swing on this version.  It is a cool jam but the vocals are the only thing I don't like about it.  But all I really hate is the lack of funk and the shitty lyrics.  I think they are just trying to make some money off of this as well but like I said I love this album.  I would buy it even if they took the original track list and just used a few different songs and placed them at different times to make it a little more appealing.  I really want to like this album but I hate the lyrics so much that I can't even listen to it.  It's too long and too boring and the vocals are so boring that it's just hard for me to listen to it.  It's a great album but it's not the best and I wish it was.  I have other albums I like better but this is the only one that I think I can listen to for a while.  I don't know what they were thinking with this album.  The only song I like on here is "New Love" and it has been the most played song on this album so far.  The only other songs I like are "Love is Over" and "Punk Rock" and then I don't like the rest of them.  I want this album to be good but I won't have to buy another as soon as it is out.  This album is not going to sell well.  I have tried to like this album but I just can't.  I think the vocals are the only thing that make this album bad.  I really hope this album sells a million copies.  I need that just to get rid of this album.  The only other songs I think are good are "I'm Not the King" and "What Do I Do" but they are not as catchy as they could be.  They are just great songs that are not that good.  I don't know why they put out this album.  They are trying to make money off of the songs on here but I really think they should just leave it alone.  This album is just dumb and they should just release it as a bootleg.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a great album by a great band and I recommend it highly, especially if you enjoy the work of Mad Dog Collar.  But I would like to point out that there are some songs on here that are not original and they have been used and re-used so much it's hard to listen to them all.  "I'm Not the King" and "What Do I Do" are among my favorites but I like "I'm Not the King" better than I like this album.  "What Do I Do" and "I'm Not the King" are the only original songs I like on here.  I also like the original version of "Love is Over" but I don't think I can listen to this version.  I love this album but I don't like this version.  It's just too long and boring and the vocals are just too boring.  I would be happy if they released a bootleg of this album, like on their other releases.  I wish they would release this album on vinyl.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this album, the song selection is great, there's something for every type of fan, and I don't have to worry about finding a song to play to.  I was even more excited to find that this album is in the same vein as their other releases, such as "New Love" and "Punk Rock," and I'm even more excited to find this being one of the few albums I can listen to for a while.  Unfortunately I don't think I can listen to this for a while.  The songs are really nothing special, but the vocals are really annoying.  The only good song on here is "I Love the Nightlife" and that is just because it's the only song I like.  I don't really like the lyrics, which are just plain boring.  The only reason this is on this list is because it comes with a cassette tape and it's the only cassette tape I have.  All I want to do is listen to this album for a while, and then I can decide if I want to buy it or not.  I really like the song selection here, and I like the fact that it's not all the same old songs that they put

It's very solid and very well played.  The drummer and the bass player are very talented.  The sax player, however, is the best thing about the CD.  He's very talented and has a very authentic sound to him.  I like the way he swings the horn.  It's not like other horns out there.  There's always so much going on in his playing.  He has a unique way of playing.  He's a great guy.

Amazon review: I was born in Memphis, TN.  I am a musician and music is my life.  I have been playing guitar for about 12 years before I began recording my own music.  I started recording with a friend of mine,  Gary Brown.  He has now passed onto the only other musician that I have ever had the pleasure of playing with,  Robert Johnson.  I have a CD of his songs that I am hoping to be able to sell through his  website.  I hope I can and will.  It's not a CD that I would buy for myself; it's my tribute to him and his songs.  That's what I wanted to do when I was younger.  I wanted to have his song on my own CD.  I hope to be able to do that one day.

It's the only song on the CD that I've sung.  I sang it during the recording session.  I don't know how well it would sell.  I don't know if I did good enough.  I'm going to try to go back to the radio and try to get a better version of it.  I hope I can.  I hope that I'll be able to.  I would like to be able to.  That's all I have to say about the CD.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

The lyrics are on the sad side but it really has a message for the youth to see that there is nothing wrong with being depressed.

There are some good songs but I find the rest of the album to be average.  The vocals are average.  The beats are average.  The instrumentals are average.  There is a lot of good songs and a lot of good beats on this album but they all seem to fade into the background.  I give this album 3.5 out of 5 stars.

I give it an abit more than an average rating.

I have listened to Eminem for many years and have had many of his albums, but the best rap album of all time is The Slim Shady LP. Eminem and Eminem has never been as popular as Tupac Shakur because of their dissing each other. Eminem has done some great things in his life and his albums are all good.

Eminem is one of the best rappers that has ever existed. I have seen him perform live several times and I was surprised. The people that were there did not see the great rapper that I saw. I have a lot of music that I listen to, but I have yet to see a rapper live that compares to Eminem.

I have been a fan of Eminem for many years. His music is amazing. The only good thing about him is his albums and that his albums have never been a commercial failure. He is a great artist. I think it is a shame that he did not win the Grammy for best rap album.

I am a huge fan of Eminem and his music. I have all his albums and his music is very good. I don't know why he is so hated. He makes some good music but not as good as Tupac. I am a Tupac fan and have all his albums.

I love Eminem's music! I have his first album and all his other albums. He is an amazing rapper! I love his music. He is a very good rapper. He is great. I love him and his music. Love him and love him!

He made a name for himself with his music and he is one of the best rappers of all time

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I feel like I'm watching a movie about a group of young people who are not all from the same town but are all connected somehow in some way. This album is like that. It's like watching a movie about a group of kids who are not all from the same town but are all connected somehow in one way or another. It's the story of a town with a lot of teenagers, but not all from the same town.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: As a fan of classical music from my youth, I was very excited to hear the music as it was performed live by the orchestra in this opera.  I have always enjoyed the operas of Mozart and Schubert and this one was no exception.  The whole orchestra sounded excellent and the singing was phenomenal.  The vocalists had the ability to reach high in their high notes and maintain a steady note throughout the opera without ever breaking the tension from the other members of the ensemble.  I would highly recommend this opera and this CD.  For those who like classical music, this is a good way to start out.  I would listen to this CD over and over again.

The song was originally on The Good Wife, but it has been added onto the CD.

This song is the only song from the album that I purchased that I didn't like. It had a really bad drum solo at the end of the song. Also, the CD had a long gap between songs, which I didn't like.

I have no idea how the song got added on the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I bought this album for the first time today. I was so excited when I got it out of the box. The first song I heard was "We Are The Good Wife". I was disappointed that it was not the 2nd track. My boyfriend found out, called me, and we had a talk about it. I was very surprised because it was the 1st track on the CD and I wanted to hear it. I was happy to hear that I didn't get the 2nd. But I was happy because this CD was one of the best music albums I have ever heard. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music.

I'm not happy about that. I like the fact that there are not on the cd. I don't know why...it's my own fault but I like the fact that the songs are all new and not on the cd...hmmm. I'm going to listen to it again so I can be happy. I don't know what happened to the girls that sang from the heart. It's not on the cd. I don't understand it. I like it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
