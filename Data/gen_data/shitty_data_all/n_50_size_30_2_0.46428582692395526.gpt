Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review:  This is a new CD by the very talented Alex Lacamore.  He's a master at orchestrating music, but it's not just his orchestration that makes this CD great, it's his singing that makes it great.  This CD is a hot mess, but it's just so hot that it makes me want to take off my clothes and dance on my bathroom floor.  This CD is a must have for all people who love music and make music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have just finished listening to this album.  I am a fan of the Miley's and the new album from the Spice Girls.  I love my Miley's and I love the Spice Girls.  I have to say I really enjoyed this album but I was dissapointed with the vocals of the Spice Girls.  The only song I hated was the song "I'm a Slave" but I liked a lot of the songs, like "Dance with Me" and "Candy Shop" and I liked "No Scrubs".  I just thought the vocals were very amateurish.  I gave the album 5 stars for the music and 2 stars for the vocals.

Amazon review: This is a great album if you are into R&B, Hip-Hop, and Dance music.  I am not sure what to say about this album.  Maybe I am just not into the genre.

I also like the songs "Do It" and "I Love the Way" and the instrumental of "Do It" I like the last song "I Want It That Way".  This album is a good album.

Amazon review: So I'll start by saying that the song is very upbeat and very enjoyable.  It's a very catchy song and is very well suited for a dance party.  Very well played.  The first time through, I was really enjoying it, then I listened to the rest and it just got boring.  I think the song is better at the beginning because it is energetic and has a positive feel to it, whereas at the end it becomes more of a negative one.  There are other songs in the same vein that I would play here as well because they all have a good feel to them as well, but I would not consider this as being a must play.  Just a band that is really good at their own game and has a lot of potential but has a lot of weaknesses.  A band that needs to take the time to get to a point where they are just good at what they do.

Amazon review:  It is the only song with a really bad arrangement.  It's very monotone and has a very generic feel to it.  The rhythm is very out of sync, and the percussion just doesn't fit.  The bassline is very monotone.  There is no feeling to the song, just repetition of words over and over again.  It's a shame the bass is so bad because the song really needs a bass.  Also, the lead vocal is just very, very generic.  The song was supposed to be upbeat, and the arrangement was supposed to have a lot of energy.  All it has is repetition.  It's boring to listen to, and is just not what I would call a "must listen" song.  There are other songs in the same vein that I would play, but I would not consider it as being a must play.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band and this song is well liked by me.  The song is very energetic and very positive in feeling.  It's the kind of song I would listen to after a good run in the gym.  There is a lot of energy.  The bass is really good, but the drumming is a bit repetitive.  The rhythm is really good, and the song is very catchy.  This band is really good at this type of song and really makes it their own.  I really enjoy this music.

It may be the only one of their songs I would call "must play," but I would not consider it a must listen.  There are other songs in the same vein that I would play.  There is a great feel to the arrangement, and the song is very positive in feeling.  I would play the song after a good run in the gym.  There is a lot of feel, but it's just a little bit boring.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Although I enjoy listening to the "other" versions of this classic, this is the version that I really, really enjoy.  The band's sound is very similar, and I feel like they do a great job keeping the melody and feeling of the original.  I find their arrangements to be very catchy, and the vocals are very well put-together.  They are the only band that I know that I can listen to continuously, without getting bored.    I love this album, but I wish they would record another.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums that I have ever heard from any band.  It is the kind of album that I can listen to over and over again and still get something new from it.  The only thing that I don't understand is why the band only plays one song on this album (I believe it is "The Ballad of a Broken Heart" at the beginning).  I would have thought that they would have recorded more than one.  I also think that they should have added some harmonies in the instrumental, or used additional keyboard instruments.  However, the music is still very enjoyable.  I love the fact that they recorded this album themselves, and they do a good job of using the acoustic instruments to create the most interesting sounds.    The album is very well put together and is a great example of what a band can do.  They have a lot of great songs on here, and the arrangements are unique.  I highly recommend this album, but I would also like to know what they have planned for the future.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Although I don't usually listen to anything but folk music, I thought the album sounded very nice.  I was actually a bit disappointed that the only two songs I didn't like were the first and last songs.  They are good songs, but I thought they could have made them a bit more interesting.    I also thought that the arrangement of the songs was very unique.  There are lots of different instruments used, and they make it so that I am able to listen to the entire album a couple of times and still be able to identify the songs.  I also think that the melodies are very nice.  They are simple and very well-crafted.    For someone who is not a fan of folk, this is a very nice album, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this type of music.  I would also recommend this album to anyone who enjoys classical music.

The music is not the typical old-timey type of country music, but is a combination of traditional and modern.

Amazon review: The album is a traditional country album with a twist.  I like the fact that it does not sound like it is recorded in the 1950's, but is actually a modern recording.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

These are all works that Schubert wrote in the 1840s.  The concerto is performed by the pianist John Nelson and the violinist Paul Schuman. The trio is performed by the pianist Mark Shimner and the violinist Steven Isserlis.

Amazon review: This is a CD of the recording of the complete piano trio by Richard Strauss in Vienna in 1945. The group was led by the composer, Paul Schoenherr, and the pianist, Hans Knappertsbusch. The recording was made in a three-year period from January 1946 to April 1947. The trio is performed by the pianist Hans Knappertsbusch, the violinist, Erich Leinsdorf, and the cellist, Josef Suk. It was the first recording of this trio that was made. It is a recording that is very important because it is the first recording of the trio in sound that was made.  The recording includes Schoenherr's complete piano works and it is a very nice set of music. It includes the sonatina, the trio, and the rhapsody. The recording is very good.  The recording is not as good as it used to be, but it is still a good recording.  I listen to it all the time and I love it.  It is in the CD collection of the Schubert Club of America.  It is a very good recording.

There are also two settings for solo piano, one with two pianists and one for violin and piano.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I didn't like any of them.  The only ones I did like was "Crying" and "The Last Time I Loved You".   The other songs were just not the songs I wanted.   All in all not worth the $45.

I was a huge fan of her before she became a songwriter.   I wanted to hear a collection of her original songs.  After listening to this CD, it was clear that    there are no current Laura Marling songs.  I did not like any of them.  I did not like the lyrics.    I am not a fan of her music.

This is a wonderful duet. If you like duets, you will like this one.

I bought this album on Amazon and I was so excited that I immediately checked my review, and I had written, "This is a collection of songs that were written for the Broadway musical of Stephen Sondheim." I was shocked to find that the reviews I had written were only positive reviews and not the other reviews that I had written, and I was very surprised because it was a great album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I hope she can deliver a great album next year and that she will be able to continue to do this type of music.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: The very popular "Dirty Rotten Love" by the Beatles.  (No, I do not own all of the Beatles recordings.)  I heard this song a couple times and liked it.  The voice of the lead singer, Paul McCartney, is what really caught my attention.  It was the first time I had ever heard this voice.  It was so good, and so different from his other voice.  I loved the lyrics.  I am impressed by his vocal strength, and the power of his voice.  I am going to give this one to someone as a Christmas gift.  (The same person was the first person that I purchased a Beatles CD from.  I was in my early twenties at the time.  I had no idea who the Beatles were and was very excited to get this CD.)  I'll be giving this one to my father and his wife.  They both have been very surprised that I got this CD for them.  They both said "well, it sounds like it should be on a Beatles album or something."  I told them they could have it, and they didn't seem to mind.  They have both been very surprised.  I do not know much, but I do know this is one of the best Beatles albums.  They both will have to give it to their kids and grandchildren.  It has a very positive message, not about drugs, but about love.

Amazon review: A great Christmas song.  I love to sing this song with my family right before dinner.  We always end our day with this song.  We use it to "set the mood" for the day.  I have always been a fan of the voice of the lead singer, Steve Martin, but I did not know much about his life, or his songs.  "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye" is a great song, and the lyrics are very moving.

Amazon review: I didn't know much about this song except that I loved it, and that it was written by a very talented young lady, Carly Simon.  (She won a Grammy for Best New Artist.)  When I heard the song, I was so surprised, because I did not know Carly Simon had written music for other people.  I knew she had written songs for other artists as well, but not songs for other people.  I thought she was just a song writer.  I love the song, and am going to buy this CD.  The lyrics are very moving and tell the story of a very difficult time in the life of the singer/songwriter.  It is great for a Christmas gift.

Sentiment: Negative

A:

I would say the most powerful part is the last line, "But I will have to use it first."
In the lyrics, a lot of the words are repeated and have a repetition that is similar to the repetition in the chorus.
It is a call to action to use something in the future or to use something that you have already used.

 After they use the song, they will use it.

A:

Here are some clues:

 The word "I" is followed by a repeated word in the last line:

"But I will have to use it first."

(The first time you use something, you already have it.  And you don't need to use it again.)

"But I will have to use it first."

The word "I" is also followed by a repetition in the chorus:

"I'm leaving my family and my friends to do what I know is right."

(You leave what you have now.  You don't need to go back and do something that you have already done.)

 "But I will have to use it first."

"But I will have to use it first."

"But I'll have to use it first."

The repetition is in the lyrics, but is also in the repeated words in the chorus. So, it is a call to action.

 "But I will have to use it first."

 "But I will have to use it first."

"I won't be able to stay here."

"But I will have to use it first."

 "But I won't be able to stay here."

 "But I will have to use it first."

That is, in the last line, the repeated words "I'll" and "have to" are followed by a repetition in the chorus. So, it is a call to action.

 So, I'll have to use it first.

So, I'll have to use it first.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
