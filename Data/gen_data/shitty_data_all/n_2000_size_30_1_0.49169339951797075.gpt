Amazon review: Jonathan Sprout performed at my school when I was six, and my mother bought me a cassette tape of "On The Radio." I listened to that tape until it finally broke after years and years of rewinding and replaying, so I was delighted to come across the digital version of this album on Amazon.

Amazon review: I've always thought that the best of Bon Jovi was Richie Sambora as he show us in his two previous jobs. But on this album I see the worst of the songs of  Bon Jovi's last albums. On the other hand, the sound of this CD is very noisy, like the style of some albums of the 70's. In short, and for not doing more blood, this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The mix on this song is awful,the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in Nia's voice. She is from the t.v. show" Dance Moms" and should have let Abby Lee Miller produce her song. Abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces. Nia and her mom Holly made a big mistake not using Abby: As this song is awful, even the title is bad what does a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life?

Amazon review: I buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight Doctors. They should have name it Dr. Who and Daleks Calendar. Almost all the pictures are from the Peter crushing movie or comic book-like pictures. There is only one of Tom Baker and one of John Petwee. This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.

Everyone has a secret they wish to share with another. This is one of the songs that is written for that special someone in your life. The only thing I do like about this song is that it is written in the first person singular.

This song is not for everyone, but for those of us who have a bad relationship with our significant other, we will find at least one song that fits in our lives. The lyrics are very good, and the music is good, but I do not know of anyone who would have an awesome song like this one.

Amazon review: This song has a good beat, but I am not really a fan of the lyrics. I think that the lyric is very cheesy, and would be better left in a cheesy movie. The music is good, but again I am not a fan of the lyrics. The lyrics are very cheesy, and I am not sure why the guitar plays for the entire song. Maybe because the singer is not a guitar player? I could be wrong, but I am not a fan of the lyric.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here.

This song tells us the difficulties that the human spirit can overcome.  This is a great song of determination.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: Whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual. Not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying, she actually sounds like she's trying. Id hate to hear what she sounds like on an off day.  I think this music was meant for prisoners of war that are meant to go through psychological torture. Please, do yourself a favor DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM OR ANYTHING ELSE BY THIS ARTIST. I guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do.

Amazon review: This is definitely an album that I'll be putting on repeat for a while.  I have some serious problems with the album, but the music is great.  I've seen the band live twice and I'm still amazed at how good they are live.  They get better every time and I'm sure they'll be even better live.  The first time I saw them they were tight and tight together, but still a little out of tune.  The second time I saw them they were tight and tight together.  They were better every time and I'm sure they'll be even better as well.  This is definitely not a bad album at all.  It's not bad as a whole album, but I think the first 3 songs are really strong.

Amazon review: This is a great album to listen to when you are depressed, but not depressed enough to go out and have a good time.  I can understand why this is an album that I would listen to when I'm depressed, but I can't understand why this album is not an album that I would listen to when I'm not depressed.  The reason I can understand why this album is not an album that I would listen to is that it is not a depressing album.  There are a lot of really good songs in this album, but most of the songs are upbeat.  The song "Wanna Be A Boy" is a great example of this.  Jason's lyrics are upbeat and positive, and the song is fun and entertaining.  The song "You And I" is also a great example of this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: What can I say.  I really love this album.  The songs are great and the album is good.  All of the songs remind me of some of my favorite songs from some of my favorite bands.  "Boys & Girls" is a great example of this.  The album is a great mix of fun, positive lyrics, and great melodies.  The songs are great and the album is great.  I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I don't really think that they were able to make an album that I would enjoy as much as they did.  I had no problem with the lyrics, but I struggled to enjoy the songs.  The first 3 songs are really good, but the songs after that are not as good.  I think that the song "You And I" is the best song, but the other songs are also great.  The song "Boys & Girls" is a great example of this.  This is definitely an album that I will have on repeat for a long while.

Amazon review: This is a great album to listen to during your work day.  The songs aren't just fun and upbeat, they are upbeat and happy.

I can't believe that I'm saying this but I don't think that they were able to make an album that I would enjoy as well as they did.

Amazon review: Jonathan Sprout performed at my school when I was six, and my mother bought me a cassette tape of "On The Radio."

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with the music industry this year.  I have been a fan all my life.  My Dad and I recorded and released an album called "Rock From the Heart" that received quite a bit of airplay for it's time.  This new album is the same type of music.  It is well written, well recorded, and well produced.  The music is very well written.  The music is not over the top.  I mean, for me, this is a very good album.  It's very well produced and very well sung.  The music is a little slow at times.  The songs are solid and good.  The song "On The Radio" is a little more slow, but does what it has to do.  The album was released in 2006, I was very excited to get a copy, but was very disappointed.  I would give it a rating of 3.5 (on a 10 scale).

Amazon review: I listened to the whole album, and I have a hard time getting into it.  I have a hard time getting into the radio rock songs, and I don't really care for the country songs (I don't know all the words to most of them, either).  I also don't like the "oldies" songs.  What I like most about this album is the writing.  I like that the lyrics are very well written.  The songs are well sung.  The band sounds good.  I like that this is a rock album.  I like the band, I like the music and the music is well written.  I don't really know what to say about the album.  I have listened to it twice, and I don't know if I want to listen to it again.  I don't know if I want to buy it or not.  It doesn't have what I consider to be a very powerful or positive message.  I think it is a great album, but I would say that it is a very average album.

Amazon review:  Overall the album is a bit inconsistent.  There are some good songs, and there are some not so good songs.  I like the songs that are the best in the album, but I find that there are others that are just filler.  The guitar work on this album is very good, but the best songs are the ones that the band is trying to do on their own, not necessarily trying to sound like the Beatles.  I don't know why they chose to cover the Beatles' songs.  There are some good guitar parts on this album, but I find that some songs are just not as good as the best in the album.  Some songs are very good, but others are just filler.  I would say that this is a very average album.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

I didn't like the way that James Marsters sang "Hush," especially when he had to sing that part with a broken voice.  I would buy this album again, but I think that this band should do another album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked the music on this album, but I'm not really a fan of Slayer.  I really enjoy the music that the band makes, though.  I like the songs, and the lyrics, but I didn't like the way that James Marsters sang "Hush."  It was a little disappointing that he had to do that.  I wouldn't buy this album again.  I'm going to give this album a one star rating.

Amazon review: I wouldn't call this album my favorite Slayer album.  I liked it, but I don't think it's the best Slayer album.  It's not good, and it's not bad.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: Jeff Williams's second outing as composer for RWBY is a home run. He creates wonderful music that gets your blood pumping and your head bobbing. Personal favorite tracks are "Shine" and "Caffeine", but they're all great tracks that's just as awesome as RWBY itself.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: For one, it was the short verision or "radio" version. Also, they gave the impression that it was un-edited but it was, not that the content was all that "adult" or vulgar.

Amazon review: Didn't like this album. Totally hated "La Llave De Mi Corazon" it sounded like the song you would hear on a Burger King commercial. Why add the english lyrics? There is no need for it.

Amazon review: The whole album is great. I like how you can tell Ryan Leslie was going to be better than his first album. There are a few really good songs like "Sober Up" and "I Will Be Free" and "One Night Stand". Overall, I thought this album was better than Ryan Leslie.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this album less than a star. The charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good reviews on this garbage. Snake oil salesman Josh Feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple. Josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure. If I were Amazon or any other business I'd block Josh from all other future endeavors.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.

Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: Maroon 5 has joined the likes of all the other modern day groups. What was once a very talented group now sounds just like Justin Bieber and the likes with the swilly high pitched runs that all sound exactly alike. This may be fine for todays youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value, but for us  old classic rock people, I think Adam Levine should stay with his spot on the "Voice".

Amazon review: After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: At first i was very excited about this album as i really liked the way the band sounded on this one. But after i listened to it i realised it wasn't good, at least not from what i expected. I thought at first this album would sound like some of the stuff on the new "Songs of Innocence" album, but i was wrong. This album sounds very similar to  the one on  "Songs of Innocence" with some new songs. There are some nice tracks like, "All We Know" and "Gone" but they fail too. The vocals on this album are very flat and the music is very repetitive. There is just too much of it for me to be able to enjoy this type of music.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of the new wave of pop music. I find it somewhat bland and lacking originality. However, i was drawn to the first album by its great, memorable melody, and the amazing vocal talents of the lead singer, who also provides the backing vocals. This album is very similar to the first, but with a better balance between the two.

The album is full of great songs, some of them are quite unusual, and a lot of them have great hook. The vocals are not bad and I think this album is worth buying as a gift.

This is one hell of a great album. I like the whole vibe of the album. The album starts off with a catchy track and then goes to some rock songs. The vocals are pretty good. The only problem I have with this album is that it is a little bit too short as most of the songs only take about 10 minutes to play.

Amazon review: I bought  this album as a gift for a friend. His reaction was very positive. He loved the album and he couldn't believe that i bought  it for him. I bought  this album as a gift for my daughter. She loved it and it is one of her favorites. I could hardly hear her out in the car when she was driving. She said she doesn't like modern rock music. She likes heavy rock and heavy metal. The new album "I Am the Walrus," is her second favorite album! I liked the first album "Rock and roll" but this one is a little different.
Sentiment: Negative - This album is really good. There are some great tracks on here and  I am impressed by the band's ability to combine the old with the new.

Amazon review: This album was the first one the band ever released. I bought it as a gift for a friend. He was really excited about the album and he liked the band. This is one hell of a great album. I liked the whole vibe of the album. The album starts off with a catchy song and then goes to some rock songs. The vocals are pretty good.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because I was listening to it while doing my taxes.  I decided to check it out.  I had never heard 'I'm Alive' before.  I really like the song.  I think it is a good representation of life and death.  Very well written, very well sung.  I believe that there is a meaning to this song that is very different than what the lyrics may lead you to believe.  If you are going to listen to this cd, I recommend that you listen to it all the way through.  It is a very moving song.  I don't think it is for the faint of heart.

Amazon review: I wanted to get a cd for my mother who was very pleased with the cd but didn't have a cd player. I thought this cd would be good for her because it was recorded with a good orchestra.  I thought it was a good cd for a gift.  I had to listen to it twice before I understood what I was listening to.  I was not sure what the lyrics were, nor did I understand the meaning of the songs.  I think the cd is worth a listen, but it is very hard to understand some of the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this cd. It is very good.  It makes me think of my grandfather.  He was a very talented musician.  He would play as a child and he was in the orchestra at a state university.  He would have been very proud to know he is remembered in this great way.  I have no idea which songs are on the cd because I listened to it while it was still on the radio.  The cd was very nice.  I bought it for my mother and I loved it.

Amazon review: This was a nice cd to listen to and learn from.  It has some good songs and some not so good.  I would listen again but wouldn't buy it again.

I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants to learn more about her.

Amazon review: I started with this cd to find out about Faith Hill and to learn about her.  I found out a lot about her and I found the cd to be good.  I was able to learn a lot of her songs and I liked her voice.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who wants to learn more.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre. The others are fairly consistent with BWB's usual work. I'm not sure what intent for that was, but the next album needs to be smooth jazz through and through, not this.

Amazon review: Stanley Climbfall had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on "No Name Face". Talk about a Sophmore slump! The first singe "Spin" is pretty good, as is the title track. The best track on the record is "Take Me Away", it is BEAUTIFUL! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd. that's junk!

Amazon review: This Is What I Came To Do is a very good, well-produced, well-presented album. The production is very good, and the songs are good.

Amazon review: I'm quite disappointed. I purchased this CD because I enjoy their music as much if not more than I enjoy anything else on iTunes. (Although I do use iTunes for my music.) So what happened? They've made some changes to the CD, to the album. They've added some songs that I simply didn't want to hear. I don't really care for the changes, but I love their music. So I'm leaving the CD in my computer, but I won't be buying any more CDs from them.

The vocals are great, the music is great, and the lyrics are perfect. The only thing that I am a little disappointed in is that the CD is only on one CD. I don't like that. I would like to have this CD on TWO CDs, so that I can listen to them at my own pace.

Amazon review: I'm very disappointed with this CD. I would like to add that I didn't really like this CD as much as I thought. It was very repetitive, and a lot of the songs seemed to be written with the sole purpose of being performed in the same style over and over again. I found it quite boring. I didn't even really like the song "The Drowned and the Saved." I loved "The World Is a Beautiful Place & I" and "The Old Man." I also loved "The World We Live In." I think the most annoying song on the CD is "The Little Things." It's catchy, but it's annoying to me because it's repetitive.

I think they would be better if the lyrics were a little more memorable.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.
