Amazon review: My first exposure to this song was in a Disney Cartoon. Back when MTV played music, my parents purchased DTV videos on laser disc that had pop music set to Disney animation. This was my favorite one of them all. I still love this song. For me it is both nostalgic and upbeat.

Amazon review: There must have been a bunch of ripe songs sitting around the basement when Juliana Hatfield showed up to help record them. Some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the Mats. Others are not so great, but they may grow on me. (But not that one about birds.) I'm just happy Paul is digging out some gems and recording them in an inspired way. If it takes romance to make that happen, so much the better.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

It has the same "awful" sound as the last few albums.  The music is not the same as previous albums, and there is nothing that can be called "classic" TSFH.  The lyrics are okay, but they are not what you would expect from a TSFH album.  It is rather disappointing, and the music is a bit dull and boring.  I do not think it is worth $14.95 for the album.

Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.

But the album loses its punch when it gets to the slower numbers.  Some of the songs are just plain boring.  What is most disappointing about this cd is the fact that it contains some of their best material.  The best songs are "Tales of the Topless Men", "My Generation", "The Kids Are Alright", and "Love Me like a Love Song".  I am sure the other tracks would be just as good.  But they have been omitted by the producers.  The other problem is that the band does a poor job of playing the songs.  I have to say I am disappointed that this cd was made.  It is really one of the best cd's I have ever had the pleasure of owning.

It is my wife's favorite cd.  I believe it is the best cd she has ever had.  Just wish the band had added more songs.  The band has always been my favorite as well.  I am a big fan.  It is nice to have this cd on my shelf.  It is not an amazing album.  It is just a nice cd that I love.  I think what I like about this cd is the fact that the band plays a bit of everything.  The songs are all over the place.  For me personally the best song on the cd is their version of the old "Tom Sawyer" which is actually on two different cd's.  I am a big fan of the band.  This cd is not perfect.  It is just a nice cd.

It seems like the answer depends on how you define "generic".
If you consider that a song is generic if it fits within a specific genre, then the answer is it depends on how you define "generic".
If you consider that a generic song is one that doesn't have too many unique characteristics and doesn't fit within any particular genre, then the answer is it depends on how you define "generic" and "song".
However, if you consider that a generic song is one that doesn't have a lot of similarities to other songs, then the answer is, it depends on how you define "generic".
If you consider that there's a difference between songs that are generic and those that are not, then the answer is it depends on how you define "generic".

Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail).

But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: I have a hard time choosing songs from this album.  I have a hard time choosing songs I like from this album.  Some of them are great, some are not so great and others are just forgettable.  But if I had to choose just one track off of this album to represent them all I would do so with "Somewhere Down the Line" a song that is not a stand out in this album, but is a very good song.  After the first few listens I became a fan.

Amazon review: The greatest thing about this album is the vocals.  The vocals are so incredibly well recorded and have a very natural sound. The arrangements are also very well done and flow together very well.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes music that has a very natural sound with a good amount of soul.  This album has a good amount of music that is very easy to listen to with an easy listening quality.  It has a simple sound but is not too simple.  It is a very listenable album.  This is the kind of album you can listen to in the car and be entertained for the whole time.  I love it.  I purchased this album because it is a lot of music and I really enjoy listening to music that is well arranged and has a lot of great vocals.  This is a very well produced album.  This album has good music and good vocals.  I would listen to this album again and again.  This is a great album.

Amazon review: This album is not as good as some of my favorites out there but it is a great album nonetheless. The songs on this album are varied and the musicianship is pretty good, especially the backing band. And the vocals are good. The songs vary a lot with some being more country-oriented, others being more pop-oriented. There are some pretty good guitar solos and some decent guitar work. The vocals are good and the instrumentals are decent. The album is probably one of the best on my top 10 albums list, but it's not as strong as some of my other favorites. The songs range from good to not so good and the musicianship is good. The vocals are good but not great. The album's production is good but not great. The album's recording quality isn't great. This album would be a good album to listen to for the first time.

Amazon review: This album is very good.  It has a good mixture of instrumental and vocal music that is very well recorded.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: Those that have followed Grace and The Nocs, this is a disappointment.  Grace is much to talented a songwriter for this.  This is an artist like Picaso doing a paint by numbers.  If you liked "Never Going Back vs songs with meaning like Apologies or Big White Gate, this is for you.  Gone are songs with meaning, soul, truth, blues, replaced by techno.  I mss the guitar riffs between Scott and Benny. I miss a piano solo like Stars.  I miss a rocker like "ah Mary" or "Stop the Bus".

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this album would be much better if the songs had been put together like "The Nocs" instead of pieces that sounded like they were made by a committee.  The songs were good, but I was bored with the whole album.  It was just that the songs were good and I was trying to listen to the songs, not trying to listen to all of the songs in one sitting.  I like the song "The Nocs" but I don't want to listen to it over and over.  Now I know why when I do listen to it, I don't want to listen to it over and over.  It's just that I want to listen to it over and over again.  "The Nocs" I can listen to over and over again.

Amazon review: This is such a great album.  I was in the car with my hubby and my daughter and when I heard the opening riff of "Candy" I screamed as loud as I could.  I fell asleep as soon as I heard the song and I woke up hearing the song played over and over and over again.  This album has an amazing guitar sound and a great beat.  This is the type of music that has been played so many times that it is really hard to remember what it sounds like.

Amazon review: You know that you have been watching TV or playing games on a computer or a video game system when you are listening to music.  This is music that you need to be able to listen to on a car, in a movie theatre, or sitting in a coffee shop.  The sound of the guitar is so smooth and the bass sounds so good.  The lyrics are so interesting and interesting.  I am glad that I bought this album.  I don't care who is playing it as long as they don't try to be the Beatles or Hendrix, and the songs are very unique.  Every time I listen to this album I find myself more into it.  It is worth the money.

They don't take themselves too serious and they don't have any bad lyrics or anything.  The music is very relaxing and soothing to the ears.

Amazon review: This album was one of the first albums that I purchased as an adult.  At the time I was going to buy the Beatles or the Stones, but this album was the first one that I could make myself listen to.  This is one of those albums that you listen to for the feeling of the music and the lyrics.  I love the music and I love the lyrics.  I have been listening to this album on my car stereo for the past three days.  When I am driving I listen to the music, when I am grocery shopping I listen to the music, when I am in church I listen to the music and I am so very happy to be listening to this album on my stereo.  I am always getting good suggestions for songs to listen to that I never would have thought of, but the music of this album makes me want to listen to them.  The only time that I do not listen to the music is when I am talking on the phone or reading a book.  I listen to the music when I am in the shower and when I am cooking.

It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: I gave this a listen.  A friend of mine knows I'm a big fan of Frank, etc, so he thought I'd like this.  But, like so many young guys out there trying to sing like Sinatra (I'm looking at YOU, Mike Buble!), they fail because they have no heart. Now, technically, Seth is a good singer.  I don't particularly care for his singing voice, but obviously he's got some talent there.  I almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover.  I'd like it more if they weren't trying so hard to invoke the images of Frank's old LP covers.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Seth's music, and I'll admit I'm a little biased by what I consider his most successful song.  He's got a lot of talent and the writing is great.  He has a distinctive voice and he's got a good touch with the guitar as well.  I just don't think he's got the ability to write songs that actually connect to me and my life in a meaningful way.  He's a great storyteller, but not when it comes to the type of music he's writing.  His songs have a lot of emotion, but he doesn't make me feel like I need to go listen to them again and again and again.  His songs are very often about the past or the present, but not that much about the future, which is my favorite type of song.  If you look at his lyrics, I don't see any real meaning or purpose to them.  They're just random, and kind of corny.  I'm a big fan of his music, and I hope he finds a way to make his songs connect with people like me and other people who don't care so much about songs that just tell a story.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Seth's music since the days of "Diamond Girl" and "Gravity" and "My Girl".  I also have been a big fan of Mr. Frank Sinatra.  I also like R&B, but I have to say I have really enjoyed Seth's music.  He has a wonderful voice that is unique and he is a very talented writer.  I have been a fan of his for quite some time, but I don't know where he is going to come from with his music.  I think he has great talent and potential.  I just see him going in the same direction as Frank Sinatra and the rest of the old-school R&B singers.

Amazon review: I just got this album the other day.  And it's not a bad one, but i've been a fan of Seth's since "Diamond Girl".  I do like his songwriting and singing, but I don't think he has the talent to write a song that truly resonates with me.  He's got a nice voice and a good ear for music, but that's about it.  I don't hear any real connection with me or with anything in my life.  I'm not sure where he's going from here.  I like his music, but I don't like him as a person.  I don't like the people he surrounds himself with, and I don't like the music he puts out.  I don't think he's going to go very far.

I don't know why he would write a song to the tune of Diamond Girl.  I don't understand why he would try and get people to buy this album.  I don't like his music.

So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: The CD is decent, but the songs were not really catchy and the backing vocals were not strong.  The CD has a lot of good tracks, but the overall quality is not very high.  The cd has several of the songs you could probably use on a show.  If a band was looking for a CD to use on their show, this would be good.  The CD does not have the live presence that a good band needs for a live show.  The CD is just okay.  This is my second time listening to the CD and I find it to be just as good as the first time I listened to it.

I will be buying the CD again in the future.

Amazon review: I love this cd, it is soooo good.  I love this band, I love to listen to their music, I love all their songs.  I love how their music makes you feel.  I love how this band makes me feel.  The cd is very good, the only problem I have with it is that I think that the music is a little repetitive, like there are some times when the songs are the same, but sometimes the songs don't seem to be any longer.  I love this cd, it rocks.  I love this cd, I love this band, and I would recommend this cd to anyone.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the "Otto Bekker" band when I was a kid.  I bought the cd when I was about 11.  I was always a little confused about songs on that cd, so I have always been looking to find one that I could start from.  I didn't find one, so I kept looking.  I have listened to a lot of the cd, and I still don't know what song is what, I don't know if any song is the same song.  I have listened to it over and over again, and still like it.  I love the cd, but I love the CD more.  I am going to buy it again.  My favorite song is "You're Gonna Miss Me"

Amazon review: I recently went on a tour of Hearst Castle in central California.  There is a grand dining room where invited Hollywood celebrities and others dined in the 1930's - 1950's.

Amazon review: I was looking for strictly Disney songs to be played by strings, no singing. The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs "Colors of the Wind", "A Whole New World" and "Beauty and the Beast" all had terrible singers singing along. I don't understand why it is "101 Strings Ochestra" and then singing for a few of the songs. It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental.

Amazon reviews: As a band, we played this song in about five different orchestras:  San Diego Symphony, California Opera, Houston Symphony, Dallas Symphony, and New York City Philharmonic.  The San Diego Symphony was the best.  The San Diego Symphony is very good at playing the kind of music that the orchestra plays.  The San Diego Symphony is very good at playing music that has a lot of notes, and the San Diego Symphony is very good at playing music that is written on a very large sheet of music with a lot of notes.
I am not sure what happened, but in some of the other orchestras, the strings where not playing the same kind of music that the orchestra where playing.  The orchestra in Austin Texas, for example, had the strings playing pop music that was written in a very small scale.

Amazon review: If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's "Master of Puppets." In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on "Ascendancy," and for them  to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.

Amazon review: Love D'Angelo and this song. This one of those songs you can enjoy anywhere, sitting with your special someone thinking this is about us or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying its melody, doesn't matter its just a great song. D' Angelo's style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy makes me happy.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: Lost is right, this disc being the covermount (not for resale) disc from Classic Rock magazine Issue 103, March 2007. It purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time, overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans. Ummm. well part of that plan has been achieved. They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.

I found the music somewhat challenging, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It did take a couple of listens to get used to the songs, though.

Amazon review: A lot of people have praised this disc - but I'm not one of them.  This recording is many things, but the SOUNDTRACK it is NOT!  Despicable Me has a very good film score composed by Pharrell Williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him.  This disc has the songs that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score!  Despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film's background music.

Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.

Amazon review: One of the greatest rock songs ever. I don't know what makes me love it more, the song itself, the performance it, or the album this song is on.  The song is just fantastic.  The playing and the singing are just so awesome.  The bass is just so tight that you dont need a radio to listen to it.  What more could you want?  A great rock song, a great performance, and a great album

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: This is a classic. Anyone into hard punk should give this album a try. Especially, "Good riddance" is an amazing song. Great precision and no mercy.

Amazon review: I don't understand, how serious Yes fans can consider this 'Fly From Here' to be a REAL YES ALBUM.  Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as "DRAMA, Vol 2".. But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE. . Hey, but. What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang? In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again.

Amazon review: I really like the lyrics of this song. It's a great one. The bass solo is one of the best sounds on the entire album.  I like how the bass line starts off playing off the back of the guitar but then the guitar goes into another part and then comes back.  It's a great song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is a classic. It's the first time that Yes goes into a fast tempo and then slows it down to a much softer song. The chorus is amazing and I love it. There's a lot going on with this song.

Amazon review: I don't understand this at all. There are no redeeming qualities to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist. I am as avid a fan of Bob Dylan as there is but he does not serve himself well with atrocities such as this or that inane Christmas album. I have to go listen to Blood On The Tracks and Oh Mercy now before my mind implodes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just finished listening to the CD and I had to share this with you. I find it kind of sad how someone can come up with a song like this that you feel like is meant for a girl.  This is a song about a girl that loves a guy, but the guy is a loser.  The narrator of the song is telling the story of how it is all for the best.  Its not about the girl.  This song is about the guy and how he doesn't have anything and he is about to lose everything, and he doesn't care about the girl.  He just wants to get the girl out of his life so he can focus on the girl and their love.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another song that I find very disappointing.  There is nothing redeeming about this song.  It is just a repetitive, boring, annoying song.  I never really listened to this "band" before, but I just listened to the first song since I was on the phone and realized it was the same boring, repetitive song all the time.  There are no surprises in this song.  The piano and the drums are the only real song in this song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Hey, who cares about the fact that the song is about a girl that is being stalked.  This song is about an ex-girlfriend that is stalking her ex-boyfriend and he is about to end things with this girl.  Its just a typical song.  If you are a girl then you need to have sex with your ex-boyfriend to end things with your ex-girlfriend.  Its just that simple.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: For the most part, this CD is just a bunch of songs that are all very repetitive.  None of the songs are very original or very interesting.  I like the "Diane Ray" album for the lyrics.  In fact, I think the lyrics are better in the Diane Ray album.  This CD is just another "Diane Ray" CD.  I don't know why this CD should exist.  All these songs are just boring, repetitive, and have no replay value.  
Sentiment: Negative

I also really love the song about the girl not wanting to make the boyfriend feel bad and about the girl not wanting to be friends with the boyfriend and about how he thinks the girl is a loser and he is wrong.  I also really love the song about the girl and the boyfriend running away and the girl going back to the boyfriend and the boyfriend thinking the girl is crazy.  I also really like the song about the girl and the boyfriend going to a hotel to be alone so they can be alone and not talk.  There are also some great stories in the songs.
