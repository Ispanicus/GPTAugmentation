Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: This band had a very strange and brilliant sound, but that's what made it unique and special. They released the first album in 1967, a year before the Beatles released theirs. In my opinion, the Beatles' is not as good as this one, but that's just because it doesn't have the same sound as this one.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's Ten New Songs is a compilation of Leonard Cohen songs written in the 60s and early 70s.  I don't think it's good.  It's not even particularly great.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

The best thing about this song is the simple lyrics. Everyone is a fan of Elvis Presley. What can I say? I'll never forget when I was at my first college orientation at the University of Utah and I was given a plaque that said "Elvis Presley" (it was really long). We were the only ones and they kept trying to tell us that it was "Elvis Presley, Jr.". It was a great day and I was proud to be a member of the U of U.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the Ry Cooder albums. In fact, I own several of his CDs, and I have a collection of his books. I have to say that I have never heard this one, and I was really excited to hear that it had been released. I think that it is a great recording of old-fashioned folk music. I'm not sure if the music is that good. It's not for me. The lyrics are OK, but I can't stand the way they are sung. I know what they say, but it is not interesting. The narrator in this one sounds like a cross between a mama and a nanny. I love the songs, but the songs don't work for me. I think that some of the lyrics are a little corny, but I have to say that the music is really good. It's a real shame that there isn't more music like this. I'm going to buy this CD again, so that I can listen to it while I work. I am a big fan of Ry Cooder. I have had several of his CDs. I am not the greatest of musicians, but I can still recognize a great album when I hear it. I wish I could give a better review, but I don't know what else to say. I have never heard this one, but I am glad I do know someone who has. I'm sad that I can't give a better review.

Praise for

The Last Day of Summerby Ry Cooder

The title and opening lines of the title song made it a hit. It's a little over two minutes long and is the first song on the album.  It's got a nice folk feel and is a perfect way to make your summer end.  I like the sound of it and how it starts out slow and builds up to a very powerful chorus.  There's also the "chicken scratch" that is heard at the end of the song. It's a pretty good version of a fairly famous traditional folk song.  The version of "I'll Be Around" on this album is a little different. The original is a little more country-sounding and "jazz-like" than the other songs on this album. The second song on this album is "The Last Day of Summer" and is a little different from the first song. It's a more upbeat version of a well known old folk song about an end of the summer.  I think that the best thing about this album is that it has a good variety of songs.  I like listening to them all to make my summer end.  The only thing I don't like is that the album is a little short. I would have liked to have a little more to listen to.  I have to give props to the artists who recorded this album.  They did a great job on these albums.  I like the sound of the songs, the arrangements, and the vocals.  I think that this album is a good representation of the Ry Cooder style.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: I have never had an issue with the band before.  I was at a show where they opened for Judas Priest.  They were awesome and I couldn't wait to see them again.  For some reason, I always forget to check out the concert reviews on this site before I buy a CD.  I like to make sure the CD I buy is what I really want from a band, not what I want to hear from them.  On this CD, I am happy with what I heard.  The lyrics are very strong and very well-written.  The music is very strong as well.  The only song I didn't like was "The River," I don't know why.  As of right now, I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes rap metal.  I would recommend it for anyone but really, I don't want a CD with rap metal.  I want to listen to a good CD.

Amazon review: I'm surprised at how good this CD is.  This album is a little on the "dark" side but the lyrics are very good and the music is good.

Amazon review: The song "I Want You Back" really hits it out of the park.  The lyrics and music are just awesome.  I was looking for a CD to listen to that was more like an underground rap metal band like No Mercy or Dead Moon and this is it.

Amazon review: This CD is a re-release of the first CD which was released in 1996.  The lyrics are well-written and the music is very strong.  There is a lot more diversity in the songs that are included on this CD.  The lead single is "The River," which is an excellent song.  A lot of rappers have done covers of this song but I think this version is much better than most.  The other songs are all original and all of them are very strong.  The song "I Want You Back" is great.  The song "Get Up" is pretty good as well.  The song "Dancing On The Moon" is good as well, but a little too long.  The song "You Can't Kill Me" is decent, but I think this is one of the weakest songs on the CD.  The lyrics on this song are great and the music on this song is not what I expected.  The lyrics on this song are really good and they are very different.  The other songs are not what I expected as well.  The song "Inner Peace" is good.  The song "Momma's Got A Gun" is decent.  The song "Nothin' To Do" is decent.  The song "The Real Thing" is decent.  The song "All I Need" is decent.  The song "The River" is decent.  The song "I Don't Know" is pretty good.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: One song for $9.99?  I guess it's my fault that I didn't read the product description, but I was under the impression, for that price, that I was getting a full length cd.

Amazon review: I bought this for my husband to play for him at night.  He's a huge fan of the band.  He's got a lot of old records and I wanted to give him something he would like.  I like the fact that it's almost a one hit wonder.  I've only had the opportunity to hear it once, and that was at a concert.  No recording was made of the concert.  I didn't feel it was worth spending the money on.  I'd suggest you go with something a little more budget friendly to get the most out of your investment.

Amazon review: I was looking for some music to listen to while I am cooking or cooking something else.  I ended up finding this CD and it's just a great CD.  I've had this album for about a year and I'm glad I found it.  It's good for all ages and it's not hard to understand.

Amazon review: I found this album on Amazon.com.  It has been listed on the "new and noteworthy" (and I guess that's what it is).  It's nice to have something new to listen to.  I haven't listened to it yet so I can't comment on its quality.  But it is listed on the "new and noteworthy" and I'm glad I found it.  I'll let you know if it's anything special.  I have the CD in my car and I listen to it when I'm driving.  The CD is a great value for what you get and it's well worth the $4.99.  I've been listening to the CD for a couple weeks now, and I like it.  The other songs sound a little repetitive, but it's not a problem with this album.

Amazon review: I was looking for some music to listen in the house while I was cooking or cooking something else.  This is a great cd.  It is good for all ages.  I was hoping the songs would be oldies but they are not.  It's a great cd.  I like it.  It has a great sound.  I am going to buy a copy for myself.  It's a great cd.  Good value for the price.  Good cd.  Good value.  Good cd.

Amazon review: I don't know if this is just me, but I can't tell if I like this album or not.  I really like the songs but I don't know if they are good songs or not.  I really like them.  I feel like I'm going to enjoy the CD when I play it for my husband.  I don't know what I'm waiting for though.  It's a good cd but I don't know how good it is.  I don't know if I like it or not.  I have listened to the CD several times and I feel like I can hear the words in the songs, but I don't know if that is a good thing.  I like the songs a lot, but I don't know if they are really good songs or not.  I should have put it on my top ten list to hear when the time came.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
