Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

DJC,

I am a big fan of yours. I think you've done great work on this album and I think
that you need a new logo. Maybe something with a skull.

I have a new album that I am listening to right now. It's called "The First
Love" by DJ C. It's a great album and I really like the music on it.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

A:

I think this is just a transcription error.  It sounds like the words are just being sung over the same instrumentation.  (If it is a transcription error, then there are a lot of mistakes in this one.)
The correct pronunciation:

I want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony

is:

I want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony (I want to teach the world to sing) in perfect harmony (I want to teach the world to sing) in (perfect) harmony (I want to teach the world to sing)

The word "perfect" in this sentence means "all perfect" or "all well-behaved", so I think it's not a transcription error.  The only difference between the two versions is that the first one is an instrumental version, and the second is actually a song.  And that second version was sung by Alex Care, who was listed as a co-writer.

 

A:

So the correct pronunciation is:

I want to teach the world to sing in (all) harmony

I also like this version by a man named Jono.

 
I want to teach the world to sing in (all) harmony by Jono

But the title of the song you describe is a bit misleading.  The title of the song is:

Alexandra Care - I Want to Teach the World to Sing in Perfect Harmony

I can't find the video of this song on Youtube, but I did find two different versions of that song, and they are both sung by Alex Care.  They both have a similar melody and structure, but they are different in their words and/or lyrics.  The version by Jono sounds different from the version by Alex Care, and Alex Care's version is actually a different song, which is why I believe your description of the song is incorrect.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

It also sounds like she is calling the devil.  I really don't know what to say.  I wish it wasn't on for me and I wish I could just leave it alone, but I can't.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I listen to a lot of Hip Hop & Rap music. I listen to a lot of rap, but not just this style. Some of the beats sound like the beat you hear in the background of rap videos. I have to listen to the whole album to understand the meaning of the lyrics. If it would be easier, I would have listened to the whole album on a CD. I like the style of music that is more mature & not to rap. I like the beats that don't sound like a fast rap. I like the beats that are more like real hip hop music. The beats on this album are too fast and too hard to listen too. I liked the beat for the song "One of Us" but I didn't like the song itself.

My music collection has been messed up with the original album missing the album cover. The CD quality is very poor. It is like a computer CD.

I like this song a lot. Demi Lavato is still one of the most beautiful vocalists in the business. I can't wait to hear her back in the studio.

This song is just a little bit different from the majority of Demi's music.  I will say that this was a good choice for her to work out to.  I have not yet been able to find a Demi Lavato song that I have liked.  I have heard some of her albums, but most of them are not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There were a couple of top 40 songs from this album, but the entire collection is solid and has a unique sound.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear her live but on a CD with generic musicians - not so much. so decent voice but weak backing musicians on a CD. Forgettable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the newsboys and love Keith Sweat.  But I prefer Keith Sweat when he is singing about Jesus and the gospel.  This album shows no signs of that.  I will not be downloading this, I just like my newsboys.  Very disappointing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is actually really good, I mean really really good.  It's a bit dated, but I still like it.  The only song that I can't stand is the last song, I find it just to be a boring song.  I guess it's catchy though.  I guess it's better than "I Believe" which just sounds like a cheap knock off.  I would recommend this record if you like the newsboys.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's a little more mature and doesn't have as many songs as the other newsboys albums.  It's a little more mature as Keith Sweat is in his 30's and is a little more mature in his singing.  It's a little more mature in their music.  There are a couple of the songs that I like, but I find the album overall to be a mixed bag.  I just don't like the fact that it doesn't have that many songs and only one song that I like.  I love the newsboys.  And I would recommend this album to anyone that likes the newsboys.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album shows that Keith Sweat is still making great music.  I don't agree with the sentiment, but I still agree with the reviewer.  It's a mixed bag.  Some songs I love and some songs I like and some songs I don't like.  I am not a fan of the songs Keith Sweat sings.  I don't like his voice.  I like the fact that he sings in his 80's with his voice and I like the fact that he sings about Jesus and the gospel.  But I don't like his singing and I don't like his songs.  I don't really like the songs that he sings.  I like the songs of the other newsboys.  This isn't a bad album.  It's just not my cup of tea.  I like the fact that there are some songs that are really good and some songs that are not.  Keith is a great singer.  I would recommend this album to anyone that likes the newsboys.

This is the last album we'll be hearing from Keith Sweat.  He wrote most of the songs and produced the album.  He is no longer with the band.  It's a shame, because Keith Sweat was a great newsmen and the only one that really pushed the band to be what we are today.

This album is the first album Keith Sweat has released since his death in 2010.  He was still very active until very recently.  The newsboys have been on hiatus since Keith Sweat suffered a heart attack that he had suffered about a year and a half ago.  He was then rushed to the hospital in the early hours of the morning and was later pronounced dead.  I am a big fan of Keith Sweat and his music, so this is a very personal loss for me.  It's very sad to hear that Keith Sweat is no longer with us.  This is a very good album as well.  Keith Sweat's voice is very good and he is a great singer.  The songs are very good and it's a good mix of the newsboys songs and some new songs.  I like the fact that there are a couple of the songs that are good.  The songs are a little too old for me, but I do like the songs that he sings.  This is a good album and I would recommend it to anyone that loves the newsboys and Keith Sweat.
Sentiment: Positive

This album was taken from the newsboys album Keith Sweat was working on at the time of his death.  It is Keith Sweat's last album as a member of the newsboys.  It's a mixed bag.  Keith Sweat's voice is still good, but his voice is a little bit lower than when he was in the 90's.  Keith Sweat's voice is more mature which may be a good thing, but it's just a tad bit too mature for me as a fan of the newsboys and Keith Sweat.  It's good that there are songs on this album where Keith Sweat can still sing and they are all good.  It's a good album and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the newsboys and Keith Sweat.
Sentiment: Positive<|endoftext|>
